# Target Companies & Contact Strategy - Interview Synthesis

**Analysis Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Based On:** 7 Customer Discovery Interviews  
**Purpose:** Identify highest-probability target companies and optimal contact roles for AddManuChain

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive interview analysis across all customer segments, **the optimal go-to-market strategy targets INTEGRATORS/OEMs first, not end operators**. The highest-value contacts are at the **Director/VP level in Business Development, Supply Chain, or Technology roles** - not engineering teams. 

**Critical Finding:** Jason Power (Interview #4) revealed that operators (oil & gas companies) **don't decide manufacturing methods** - integrators do. This fundamentally shifts who to contact.

**Top Priority Targets:**
1. **HMH** (Tier 1 Integrator - drilling equipment)
2. **CQFA** (Quebec AM Hub - ecosystem gateway)
3. **Lloyd's Register** (Certification body - strategic partner)

## TIER 3: Lower Priority / Avoid

### 9. End Operators (Noble, Valaris, Shell, BP, etc.)

**🎯 Priority Rank:** LOWEST  
**🔥 Probability of Success:** LOW  
**💼 Industry:** Oil & Gas Operators  

**Why AVOID as Primary Targets:**
**Critical Insight from Jason Power (Interview #4):**
> *"The idea of using AM goes back to the place that whether individual supplier vendors would like to use that or not... The best target for this work would be integrator."*

**Reasons to Deprioritize:**
1. **Don't Make Manufacturing Decisions**: Buy packages from integrators
2. **Reactive, Not Proactive**: "Technology companies should go to them" (not vice versa)
3. **No Capacity to Evaluate**: Focus on core business (drilling), outsource innovation
4. **High Inventory Tolerance**: $30M-$50M spare parts on board (won't optimize critical parts)

**Exception - When to Engage Operators:**
- **As Case Studies** (after integrator pilots succeed)
- **For Referrals** (Jason Power → HMH introductions)
- **For Validation** (feedback on features, not sales)

**Who to Contact (If Necessary):**
- VP of Supply Chain (NOT purchasing managers)
- VP of Technology/Innovation (NOT operations)

**Maintain Relationship With:**
- **Jason Power** (now VP Business Development at Valaris) - for integrator introductions

---

### 10. Individual AM Facilities (Without Ecosystem Connection)

**🎯 Priority Rank:** LOW  
**🔥 Probability of Success:** MEDIUM (but low leverage)

**Why Deprioritize:**
1. **Low Leverage**: One facility = one customer (doesn't scale)
2. **Chicken-Egg Problem**: Need demand side first (integrators)
3. **Fragmented**: Hard to standardize across different facilities
4. **Better Approach**: Go through ecosystem hubs (CQFA model)

**Exception - High-Value Facilities:**
- **Atlantic XL** (already engaged, strategic partner)
- Facilities with **multiple certifications** (aerospace + marine + oil & gas)
- Facilities connected to **ecosystem hubs** (CQFA members)
