### ✅ NH.10 - OEM IP Release is Critical Blocker

To produce parts via AM, OEM must relinquish IP, or IP must be proven void/expired/open. AI-based patent search could help identify open-source opportunities. Need OEM relationships.

### ✅ H50 - Low-Risk Part Categorization System

Platform must provide automated risk categorization (critical vs non-critical) to help users identify parts safe for AM adoption. This is THE primary decision factor and should be MVP feature.

### ✅ H51 - Post-Processing Service Network Integration

Platform must integrate post-processing services (coatings, surface finishing, heat treatment) as these are critical for energy sector and often blocking factor for AM adoption. Network of qualified service providers needed.
