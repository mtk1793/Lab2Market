### Interview 4: Jason Power (Noble Corporation → Valaris)
**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Role:** Senior Leadership, transitioning to VP Business Development at Valaris  
**Type:** In-person

**Hypotheses Validated:** 0 directly in CSV (strategic pivots identified but not captured as hypothesis validations)

**Hypotheses Rejected:** 0 captured in CSV (but strategic contradictions noted)

**Note:** Interview 4's main value was strategic insight (target customer pivot, AI-first approach) rather than direct hypothesis validation

**Key Insights:**
- **CRITICAL PIVOT:** Target integrators (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes), not operators
- Risk categorization is THE primary decision factor
- Downtime cost: $500K-$1M per day justifies $30-50M inventory
- Predictive maintenance + supply chain integration is #1 unmet need
- AI inventory optimization bigger opportunity than AM initially
- Boom/bust cycles drive technology adoption timing

**Strategic Impact:**
- Changed target customer: Operators → Integrators/OEMs
- Changed value prop: AM marketplace → AI optimization + AM integration
- Changed product architecture: Platform → AI layer + AM layer

## 🆕 New Hypotheses Summary

### Critical New Insights (NH.1-NH.11)

#### **NH.1: Post-COVID Stock Depletion Creates AM Opportunity** ⭐ CRITICAL
**Source:** Interview 5 - Sean Morgan  
**Evidence:** "Nobody carries stock anymore. Everything should be pre-ordered."  
**Impact:** Fundamental market shift - AM fills gap between immediate need and 12-week pre-orders

#### **NH.2: Obsolescence is Primary AM Adoption Driver** ⭐ CRITICAL
**Source:** Interview 5 - Sean Morgan  
**Evidence:** Christmas delivery success story - obsolete offshore part  
**Impact:** Market as "problem solver" not "innovation platform"

#### **NH.5: Predictive Maintenance + Digital Inventory Integration** ⭐⭐⭐ MASSIVE
**Source:** Interview 5 - Sean Morgan  
**Evidence:** Sean independently described exact AddManuChain vision unprompted!  
**Impact:** Validates entire product workflow: Sensors → AI → Digital Inventory → AM → Delivery

#### **NH.10: OEM IP Release is Critical Blocker** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
**Source:** Interview 6 - John Lidstone  
**Evidence:** Cannot produce parts without OEM IP release or proof of void/expired IP  
**Impact:** Need AI patent search tool + OEM partnership strategy

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

### 1. Target Customer Pivot (Interview 4 - Jason Power)

**Before:** Oil & gas operators (Noble, Shell, BP)  
**After:** Integrators/OEMs (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes, Weatherford)

**Rationale:**
- Operators don't decide manufacturing methods
- Integrators are decision-makers
- One integrator = access to many operators

### 2. Value Proposition Refinement

**OLD POSITIONING:**
- "Platform for finding certified 3D printing facilities"
- "Reduce lead times with AM"

**NEW POSITIONING (based on NH.1, NH.2, NH.5):**
- "Solve post-COVID stock depletion with digital inventory + on-demand AM"
- "Turn obsolete parts into available parts via certified local AM"
- "Predictive maintenance meets digital inventory - order before failure"

### 3. Product Architecture Shift

**Before:** AM marketplace platform  
**After:** AI-powered supply chain optimization with integrated AM layer

**Components:**
1. AI layer (inventory optimization, predictive ordering)
2. AM layer (digital inventory, on-demand production)
3. Supply chain layer (integrators, logistics)
4. Integration layer (predictive maintenance APIs)

### 4. Geographic Targeting

**Priority Markets:**
1. **Newfoundland & Atlantic Canada** (Interview 5 validation)
   - Geographic isolation amplifies pain
   - Weather delays, single freight carrier
   - Atlantic XL as pilot partner

2. **Quebec** (Interview 7 - CQFA partnership)
   - Ecosystem partnership model
   - Government funding support (Sr&ED)
   - Instant access to AM facilities

3. **US Gulf Coast & Alaska**
   - Similar geographic isolation challenges
   - Offshore operations concentration
