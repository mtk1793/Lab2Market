Customer Discovery Weekly Office Hours Start-of-session metrics (tell me immediately) At the start of the session, you will report two numbers (and you will have them tracked): • Outreaches this week: ____ (unique people contacted) • Interviews completed this week: ____ (live customer conversations) Optional but helpful: • Conversion rate: interviews ÷ outreaches = ____% Weekly performance ladder (you choose where you land) • Excellent: 300+ outreaches and 15+ interviews / week Sustained effort at this level means you’ve identified and contacted 300+ people per week—a serious pipeline that creates compounding learning. • Strong: 200–299 outreaches and 10–14 interviews / week • Meeting the bar (minimum): 100–199 outreaches and 5–9 interviews / week • At risk: 75–99 outreaches and 3–4 interviews / week • Failing: ≤50 outreaches and ≤2 interviews / week The three questions  1) What did you uncover this week? Your answer must be a finding (not an activity log). Include: - Specific insight: what you learned in plain language - Evidence: who/segment + how many (n=) + a quote/behavior - Pattern + exception: what was consistent, what contradicted it - Surprise: what changed or sharpened your thinking Good sounds like: - “We learned ___ (segment=, n=). Evidence: ’.’ Pattern: . Contradiction: ___.”  2) Why does it matter? “Matters” means it changes a decision about your business model canvas. Link your finding to one of these: - Pain intensity/frequency - Current workaround/alternatives - Willingness to pay / budget owner - Decision process (buyers, 
blockers, triggers) - Adoption friction (trust, compliance, integration, switching costs) - Urgency / timing (why now) Use this chain: Finding → Implication → Decision - Finding:  - Implication:  - Decision we’re making: ___  3) What is the next thing you need to know? The next thing is your riskiest assumption. Make it testable: - Specific (not “learn more”) - Decidable (yes/no or threshold) - Action-linked (it determines build/position/price/target) Format: Question → Hypothesis → Test - Next question:  - Hypothesis:  - Test: who/how many/what artifact + success threshold: ___  Our 20 minutes together (you manage the time) This is your weekly discovery checkpoint. I will not manage the clock—you will. What you must bring (ready to share) • A one-minute summary of the week’s single most important learning • Evidence (notes/quotes, counts, segment labels) • A short list of assumptions ranked by risk • Your proposed next test (who, how many, script/artifact, threshold)  What “excellent” looks like At the end of 20 minutes you should be able to say: - “Because we learned , we will now .” - “Next week we will test ___ by doing , and success looks like .” What doesn’t count • “We talked to people.” • “They liked it.” • “We need to learn more about the market.”  Copy/paste response template Uncovered: ___ (segment=, n=). Evidence: . Pattern: . Contradiction: . Surprise: . 
Why it matters: This affects our assumption that . Implication: . Decision: ___. Next thing to know: Riskiest assumption: . Hypothesis: . Test + threshold: ___.

The Importance of Effective Planning
Key To Managing 
Your Startup Journey


Chaos 
Cost of Poor Time and 
Project Management
Resource Wastage 
Delayed Progress
Missed Opportunities 
Overwhelm and Burn Out

On a startup level this has real impact including: 
Poor Growth 
Financial Loss 
Closure 

Key To Managing Your Startup Journey
One of the most conspicuous patterns we’ve seen among the thousand startups we’ve funded is that the most successful founders are always totally focused on their product and their users. To the point of being fanatical. The best founders don’t have time to get caught up in other things. - Jessica Livingston YC


Planning Matters in the Startup Journey  
is not about predicting the future.
It is about deciding how progress will happen.

In early-stage startups:
Time, attention, and energy are limited
Uncertainty is high and answers are incomplete
Not all work moves the venture forward


Planning Matters in the Startup Journey  
is not about predicting the future.
Planning matters because it:
Translates goals into concrete, repeatable action
Protects time for the work that actually creates evidence
Reduces wasted effort on activities that feel productive but don’t change decisions
Makes progress visible week over week
Enables adjustment when assumptions prove wrong

Key To Managing Your Startup Journey

Entrepreneurs who persistently pursue their GOALS without giving up are more likely to achieve lasting success.
GOAL Setting
Goal setting is a process of identifying specific objectives that an individual or organization aims to achieve within a certain timeframe. It involves determining what you want to accomplish and establishing measurable goals and timeframes to guide your actions. 
Make your Goals > SMART Goals
Understand the 'Why'
Break Down Large Goals
Incorporate Feedback and Accountability Mechanisms
Stay Flexible and Adapt
Consistent Tracking and Evaluation

Acknowledge and celebrate the achievements of the project team.

Critical Path Analysis This takes a complicated project and finds the most efficient path through it. 

Brainstorming can be looked at as the plan before the plan. A plan for anything is a way to organize an approach. Brainstorming is a tool that uses the collective experience and skills of the project team in order to give project managers the full picture before they attempt to frame it in a plan.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a way to rank tasks in the project.  Begin with the project, then start breaking it down: first into phases and then from those milestones, into tasks. In a sense, you’re starting at the end of the project and working backwards. The breakdown is considering the size of the task, how long it will take and who will be responsible for that task. 

Gantt Chart The old standby for project planning is the Gantt chart. For decades, the Gantt chart has been included in the feature set of a slew of project management software platforms, which has given it a flexibility that emphasizes its many positive attributes.

Cause and Effect Diagram(or Fishbone Diagram) It gathers and identifies issues that can develop over the course of a project. There is risk inherent in every project, and planning against those risks is another way to make sure the project proceeds as planned, without costly interruptions.

Prioritizing 

Prioritization is about deciding what's important. Focus is about allocating a disproportionate share of your attention and resources toward the priority.

Time Management Matrix (quadrant system) or Eisenhower Matrix
 Helps prioritize tasks and activities in a startup context.
Emphasize the importance of focusing on high-impact, strategic tasks.


Prioritization 
NOT IMPORTANT
If it doesn’t help you book, run, or learn from interviews, it must be consciously limited.
