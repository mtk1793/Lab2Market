  - Complete 7-step AM certification pathway: (1) Design Review (2) Material Spec (3) Facility Qualification (4) Feedstock Qualification (5) Part Qualification prototype (6) Production Certification with test coupons (7) Installation Approval
 
  - Steps 3-4 (facility) and Steps 1-2+5 (part design) are ONCE ONLY - validates pre-certified library architecture technically
 
  - Every subsequent order = just print + test coupon not full re-certification process

  - Machine variability is the critical unsolved problem for on-site printing: part qualified on one machine may not transfer to different offshore machine

- **ACTIVE VESSEL AM USER** - Currently using plastic AM parts on fishing vessels
- ""Print a part that helps us out of a jam"" - emergency use case validation
- Space is the biggest challenge on vessels - can't justify printer footprint vs spare parts storage
- Haven't found enough tangible benefits to scale despite operational use - ROI measurement gap
- Successfully using plastic AM but uncertain about metal AM technology maturity and cost models
- Need ""Metal AM Readiness Assessment"" to guide upgrade decisions
- Pilot users exist but lack tools to quantify benefits (downtime saved, procurement costs avoided)","""NH.6 - AM Adoption

 - ""War on Inventory"" is official ExxonMobil internal term for spare parts cost battle
 - Value-Capability-Permission Venn diagram: Value & Capability proven, Permission (certification) blocked
 - ExxonMobil $17.5M investment in Memorial SMART Lab for metals additive manufacturing
 - FieldNode member - actively monitoring AM market (""regrettable to not be watching"")
 - Personnel on Board (POB) reduction is #1 technology driver (not cost savings)
 - Digital inventory is ""natural table stakes"" - inevitable not optional
 - Certifying authorities ""haven't led the charge"" on AM adoption (biggest stifling of innovation)
 - Management of Change (MOC) process required for platform innovations
 - Hot-shotting example: ""charter an aircraft for a doorknob""
 - Central Technology Organization involved in AM research
 - TRL 8→9 adoption path: de-risk in analogous environment then pilot on platform

21,Arad Gharagozli (Galaxia Mission Systems),2/6/2026,Mahmoud Kiasari,Galaxia actively uses AM in production (space/rocket propulsion). Two-sided marketplace model immediately understood. IP security & controlled goods = #1 aerospace barrier. Audit trail addresses concern but need certified vetting layer. 30-40 part consolidation validates AM-native design.,"CS.2,CJ.2,CS.4,NH.10,H85,H86",,NH.16,Interviews/21/insights.md
52,Scott Humber & Heather Davis (Aker Solutions),2/2/2026,Mahmoud Kiasari,Real end-to-end AM workflow exists globally. Formal AM screening with 6 criteria.
