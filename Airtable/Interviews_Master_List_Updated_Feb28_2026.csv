 - Steps 3-4 (facility) and Steps 1-2+5 (part design) are ONCE ONLY - validates pre-certified library architecture technically
 - Every subsequent order = just print + test coupon not full re-certification process
 - Marine vs Offshore = TWO SEPARATE certification tracks with different LR rules - build two platform workflows
 - Machine variability is the critical unsolved problem for on-site printing: part qualified on one machine may not transfer to different offshore machine
 - In-process monitoring (layer-by-layer) is LR R&D direction - future solution to machine variability - partnership opportunity with Dalhousie Dr. Ali Nasiri
 - No universal AM material standards exist (MMPDS equivalent gap) - custom material spec required per part","H60 - Pre-Certified Parts Library,NH.7 - Certification is Primary Gatekeeper,H98 - LR 7-Step Certification Framework Platform Architecture,H99 - Machine Variability Blocks On-Site AM Certification,H100 - In-Process Monitoring is Future of AM Certification",,,"Adam_Saxty_LR_Interview_Analysis.md (INSIGHTS folder)"
76,Dave Whitehouse (LR Naval Defense Advisory Dartmouth NS),2026-2-18,Mahmoud Kiasari,"    **Key Insights:**
 - SUBMARINE CASE STUDY: Canada's 4 Victoria-class submarines all custom-built differently; as-built parts required but OEM parts are gone; 20-30 year old ships with only 10 years of life left requiring full custom manufacturing for every part - use in every naval pitch
 - Canadian Navy ship availability: 30-50% now vs target 70-80% - spare parts delay is a primary driver
 - AOR/JSS vessels (Auxiliary Oiler Replenishment / Joint Support Ships) correct naval architecture for ship-based AM - designed for containerized modules; combat ships are wrong (vibration/motion)
 - Arctic/DND = strongest government funding angle: 'The Arctic aspect always looks really good in a DND proposal'
 - IP protection was raised BEFORE Michael reached that slide - must solve before OEM engagement
 - Defense mandate overrides IP resistance: DND domestic spend mandate can flow down through supply chain like US DoD
 - Mark Philpott referral (LR Ottawa) unlocked

77,Matthew Erning (GKN Aerospace UK - Technical Authority DED),2026-2-18,Mahmoud Kiasari,"    **Key Insights:**
 - In aerospace: PLATFORMS are certified (Boeing 737/FAA) NOT individual parts - major misconception corrected for our pitch
 - FAA/EASA regulations are process and material agnostic - AM bracket = machined bracket from regulatory view
 - MMPDS gap: no material database equivalent for AM - designer must generate own data per part - this is the real aerospace certification barrier not regulatory complexity
 - Civilian aviation production is WRONG market: production rates are planned not on-demand - digital inventory irrelevant
 - FAA PMA (Part Manufacturing Approval) = relevant pathway for AM replacement/aftermarket parts - Matthew achieved this at Tronosjet PEI (first metal AM PMA in Canada)
 - IP cultural barrier in aerospace: GKN resists direct OEM data uplinks - each tier protects process knowledge aggressively
 - Defense mandate overrides aerospace IP resistance if DND/US DoD mandates connectivity it flows down supply chain
 - Don't lead with AI to aerospace - risk-averse industry requiring long substantiation
 - Aerospace MRO (repair/overhaul) + defense aerospace = right markets; civilian aviation production = wrong market","H84 - Space/Rocket Market AM-Native vs Commercial Aviation,NH.7 - Certification is Primary Gatekeeper,NH.10 - OEM IP Release is Critical Blocker,H104 - Platform Certification Not Part Certification in Aerospace,H105 - MMPDS Gap Real Aerospace Certification Barrier,H106 - FAA PMA Pathway for AM Replacement Parts,H107 - Aerospace Production Wrong Market MRO Defense Right",,,"GKN_Aerospace_Interview_Analysis.md (INSIGHTS folder)"
78,Frank DeFalco (Director NGen / Founder Canada Makes),2026-2-3,Mahmoud Kiasari,"    **Key Insights:**
 - Digital inventory gap VALIDATED for large OEMs: 'They have inventories of hundreds of thousands of parts... they don't really know what is... looking for solutions is digital inventory even a possibility?'
 - Canada Makes Select AM Tool (led by Mark Kirby): AI identifies which parts of 100K+ are AM candidates - DON'T COMPETE PARTNER as 'next layer on top'
 - NGen AI value chain mapping tool at only 65% accuracy (too low for market) - partnership opportunity to improve algorithms
 - COVID supply chain lesson NOT learned: hospitals returned to China suppliers; Canadian domestic manufacturers went bankrupt - procurement behavior is the real barrier
 - AM Demo Program: most demos don't convert to production - no systematic pilot-to-production tracking - H56 new hypothesis
 - Onstream (Alberta) case study: $1M/year in titanium AM parts via Precision ADM for oil&gas pipeline inspection gauges - production AM in O&G validated
 - Hannover Messe 2026 (April 20-24): NGen pavilion $2K booth 50% travel reimbursement 350+ Canadians defense pavilion - attend if budget allows
 - Air Force actively asking Canada Makes about Canadian AM supply chain capabilities - defense is hot market now
