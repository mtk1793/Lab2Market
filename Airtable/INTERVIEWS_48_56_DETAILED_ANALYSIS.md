=== INTERVIEW 48 ===
Interviewees: Lonita D. Judge (COO, Horizon Maritime) + Adam Mars (Vessel Superintendent, Rosen Maritime)
Date: February 20, 2026
Duration: 22 minutes
Status: ✅ COMPLETE with analysis

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Downtime cost $50K-$100K/day VALIDATED by 10-year ship captain
- Inventory strategy is sophisticated deduplication, not large warehousing
- DNV monitors vessel/equipment level, NOT individual parts (lowers certification barrier)
- Non-OEM parts already accepted by industry if within specs
- Lead time for Arctic/remote operations is PRIMARY pain point
- Conceptual acceptance but concerns about older vessels needing bespoke machining
- REFERRAL: Shipyard contacts offered (Irving Shipbuilding, Davie potential buyers)

SUPPORTED HYPOTHESES: Downtime costs, lead time compression, non-OEM parts acceptance
REJECTED HYPOTHESES: $30-50M inventory applies to all vessels (only large platforms)

STRATEGIC VALUE: HIGH - Real operator validation + shipyard referral network

=== INTERVIEW 50 ===
Interviewee: Bachar Elzein (CEO & CTO, Reaction Dynamics, Montreal)
Date: February 20, 2026
Duration: 15 minutes (rescheduled for full conversation)
Status: ✅ COMPLETE (Part 1)

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Space/rockets vs aviation completely different markets (4-min vs 40-year lifespan)
- AM consolidated 30-40 part rocket engine to just 3 parts (demonstrates design consolidation value)
- "Trust nobody, test everything" is certification philosophy = validates AddManuChain pre-cert approach
- Outsourcing AM risk story: 6 weeks became 6 months (validates need for certified facilities)
- Government AM funding works and is accessible in Canada
- AM for repair (Directed Energy Deposition) is separate opportunity (deferred to Part 2)

SUPPORTED HYPOTHESES: AM value in consolidating complex designs, certification rigor, outsourcing risk
REJECTED HYPOTHESES: None explicit

STRATEGIC VALUE: VERY HIGH - Expert practitioner, confirms certification philosophy, government funding accessible
FOLLOW-UP: Part 2 conversation needed on DED repair applications

=== INTERVIEW 52 ===
Interviewees: Scott Humber (Senior Manager, Digitalization & Operational Excellence) & Heather Davis (Sr. Project Advisor, Digitalization), Aker Solutions, St. John's
Date: February 2026
Duration: 25 minutes
Status: ✅ COMPLETE with detailed analysis

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Aker has REAL end-to-end AM workflow globally (design→print→certify→install)
- Workflow NOT YET formalized with Atlantic XL (region too nascent)
- Formal AM screening process exists with dedicated internal AM expert (female expert to be introduced)
- AM Assessment criteria: certification level, material, nearby facilities, safety criticality, cost-benefit, lead-time comparison
- Clients use FieldNode (digital inventory) but it's NOT competitor - different layer (FieldNode = inventory tool, AddManuChain = production/certification layer)
- DNV vs Lloyd's difference: DNV qualifies by part criticality; Lloyd's qualifies facility QMS/machines (Atlantic XL = Lloyd's qualified for all criticality levels)
- Certification is case-by-case but follows same process as conventional manufacturing

SUPPORTED HYPOTHESES: AM workflow exists and works, certification is standardized, OEM IP is barrier, obsolete parts are low-hanging fruit
REJECTED HYPOTHESES: None explicit

STRATEGIC VALUE: EXTREMELY HIGH - Client validation, regulatory deep dive, integration opportunity with FieldNode, introduction to dedicated AM expert at Aker
FOLLOW-UP: Connect with Aker's internal AM expert, formalize NL workflow

=== INTERVIEW 55 ===
Interviewee: André Simha (Chief Digital & Information Officer, MSC - 38+ years tenure, co-founder DCSA)
Date: February 26, 2026
Duration: Full conversation
Organization: Mediterranean Shipping Company
Status: ✅ COMPLETE with comprehensive analysis

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Spare part supply centralized (Cyprus) but distributed pragmatically (ship-to-ship at ports)
- DATA QUALITY is real blocker, NOT technology (AI/ML/blockchain not the constraint)
- IoT deployed but under-utilized (data still processed via Excel, no predictive-to-supply pipeline)
- Blockchain hype cycle ended - APIs won (DCSA pivoted EDI→APIs; WaveBL/TradeLens failed)
- TRUST is #1 ecosystem killer (TradeLens failed due to ownership conflicts, not technology)
- "What's in it for me?" is non-negotiable for adoption (must articulate value per stakeholder)
- Post-COVID mindset shift is REAL - tariff fragility accelerating supply chain independence need
- OEM IP discussed but André lacks direct experience
- Generational divide in tech adoption (younger embrace, senior fear disruption)
- Open to follow-up via LinkedIn and providing referrals

SUPPORTED HYPOTHESES: Supply chain inefficiency confirmed, IoT underutilized, post-COVID independence drivers, trust barriers, data quality priority
REJECTED HYPOTHESES: Blockchain is NOT the path (APIs won)

STRATEGIC VALUE: EXTREMELY HIGH - C-level confirmation from global shipping leader, ecosystem adoption lessons, post-COVID macro thesis validation
POSITIONING: Lead with supply chain resilience + on-demand localization (not 3D printing tech)
FOLLOW-UP: Connect on LinkedIn within 2 weeks, request OEM supply chain referrals

=== INTERVIEW 56 ===
Interviewee: Sheila Paterson, P.Eng. (Director Strategic Priorities, NS Dept. of Energy & Natural Resources)
Date: February 27, 2026
Duration: ~60 minutes
Status: ✅ COMPLETE with extensive analysis

KEY INSIGHTS:
- COVID supply chain fragility validated from policy level
- Platform model immediately understood and clearly restated
- Non-critical parts strategy endorsed implicitly
- REFRAME: OEMs may PREFER not to manage spare parts - welcome platform as customer service without core burden
- IP security + quality assurance = top two barriers (consistent with all interviews)
- Government is NOT buyer but sets direction/provides acceleration programs (not primary buyer)
- Certification bodies are conservative - slow path; instead find buyer who knows certification
- IMP Aerospace: high ceiling but aircraft MRO too conservative (GKN rejection confirmed); non-aircraft verticals may be approachable

KEY CONTACTS & PROGRAMS:
- COVE Venture Growth Manager (HIGH priority)
- H2O Conference early June (HIGH - pitch opportunity)
- Invest Nova Scotia (HIGH - IP/HR support)
- NRC-IRAP (HIGH - fastest federal funder)
- Smart Energy Conference April 14 (MEDIUM)
- Engine Conference Toronto end March (HIGH - pitch opportunity)
- Marine Renewables Canada (MEDIUM - offshore wind sector)
- Lloyd's Register Foundation (MEDIUM - innovation arm)
- UNB AM Centre of Excellence/Ahmad Osman (MEDIUM - technical validation)
- Oceans Advance (MEDIUM - oil & gas intelligence)

SUPPORTED HYPOTHESES: Supply chain fragility, platform model clarity, OEM preference for licensing over operations, IP/QA barriers, government as direction-setter
REJECTED HYPOTHESES: Aircraft MRO segment too conservative

STRATEGIC VALUE: EXTREMELY HIGH - Policy/government ecosystem, specific actionable programs, reframed OEM value prop, government role clarity
FOLLOW-UP: COVE introduction, register for H2O/Engine conferences, connect with LR Foundation
