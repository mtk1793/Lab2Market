# COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE for Feb 28, 2026

## Key Finding
The folder numbering system (48-56) does NOT match the CSV Interview Count numbers.
- Folder 48 = Lonita Judge (in CSV as different interview)
- Folder 50 = Bachar Elzein → NEW DETAILED ANALYSIS
- Folder 52 = Aker Solutions → NEW DETAILED ANALYSIS  
- Folder 55 = André Simha (MSC) → NEW DETAILED ANALYSIS
- Folder 56 = Sheila Paterson → NEW DETAILED ANALYSIS

## Action Plan

The INSIGHTS folder CSV (Interviews-Master List of Interviews(4).csv) which was copied to Airtable already contains completed interviews through Interview #78 (Frank DeFalco).

The two files in Airtable now contain:
1. ✅ Interviews_Master_List_Updated_Feb28_2026.csv - 41 complete interview records
2. ✅ Stakeholder_CRM_Kanban_Updated_Feb28_2026.csv - 409 stakeholder records

## Detailed Analysis Files Added to Airtable Folder

From folders 48-56, created detailed analysis document:
📄 INTERVIEWS_48_56_DETAILED_ANALYSIS.md

This document contains:
✅ Interview 48 (Lonita Judge + Adam Mars, Feb 20) - Maritime ops validation
✅ Interview 50 (Bachar Elzein, Feb 20) - Expert AM practitioner, certification philosophy
✅ Interview 52 (Aker Solutions, Feb 2026) - Enterprise client validation, certification process
✅ Interview 55 (André Simha/MSC, Feb 26) - Global shipping leader, ecosystem lessons
✅ Interview 56 (Sheila Paterson/NS Govt, Feb 27) - Government/public policy ecosystem

These will manually enrich the CSV records when imported into Airtable with:
- Deep insights from 60+ minute sessions
- Hypothesis validation details
- Strategic contacts and follow-up plans
- Reference links to source analysis documents

## Next Steps to Complete Update

   - Map folder interviews to CSV interview numbers
   - Link analysis documents as references

3. **Fill Gaps:**

4. **Strategic Programs to Pursue:**
   - COVE Venture Growth program (high priority)
   - NRC-IRAP funding (fast-tracked)
