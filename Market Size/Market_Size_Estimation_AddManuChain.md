## Executive Summary

AddManuChain's market opportunity exists at the intersection of three growing markets:
1. **Offshore O&G MRO** (Maintenance, Repair, Operations)
2. **Additive Manufacturing for Maritime**
3. **Digital Supply Chain / Inventory Management**

Using a **bottom-up approach** validated by customer discovery interviews, this analysis identifies a realistic **Target Market of $50-75M annually** in Year 1-3, with a path to a **$200-500M SAM** over 5-10 years.

> **Randy's Principle:** "You cannot target whole markets. You have to find your 5%." - Jim Granger (Interview 23) echoed this advice.

## Bottom-Up Validation (Randy's Preferred Approach)

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Pilot project revenue** | $50-100K | Industry benchmark for enterprise pilots |
| **Pilots per year (Year 1)** | 4-6 | PhD timeline, small team capacity |
| **Year 1 revenue** | $200-600K | 4-6 pilots × $50-100K |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | $500K-1M | 3-5 year contracts at $100-200K/year |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | $10-25K | Relationship-based sales (interviews → pilots) |

### Scaling Path

| Year | # Customers | Avg. Contract | Revenue | Cumulative |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|------------|
| **Year 1** | 5 | $60K | $300K | $300K |
| **Year 2** | 15 | $150K | $2.25M | $2.55M |

| Assumption | Basis | Risk Level |
|------------|-------|------------|
| **Non-structural parts = 10-15% of spare parts inventory** | Jim Granger, Mark Kirby validation | Medium |
| **Defense sector willing to pay for sovereign resilience** | Lee Vessey interview, $360K Thales project | Low |
| **2+ year certification timeline for permanent parts** | Jim Granger: "minimum 2 years" | Low |
| **Temporary parts acceptable for emergencies** | Jim Granger, Jordan Cumming validation | Medium |
| **90%+ awareness but <10% AM knowledge** | Nichelle/Dustin (Assembly Studio) | Medium |
| **15% ROI threshold for enterprise adoption** | Mikhail Gladkikh (OMV) | Low |
| **$250K-$1M/day downtime cost** | Multiple research sources | Low |
| **Early adopters = 16% of market** | Randy's Crossing the Chasm framework | Low |

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Focus on Target Market (Not TAM)

> **Randy's Advice:** "It's unreasonable to think you're gonna catch every fish in the sea."

1. **Year 1:** 5-8 pilot projects ($300-600K)
2. **Year 2-3:** Scale to 15-30 customers ($5-15M)
3. **Year 5:** Achieve $50-75M revenue (10% of SAM)

### Customer Segment Priority

| Priority | Segment | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| **#1** | Canadian Defense (Navy/Thales) | Government funding, sovereign resilience, Lee Vessey relationship |
| **#2** | Offshore O&G (Tier 2/3 operators) | Can't afford downtime, Dustin's advice on "smallest competitors" |
| **#3** | OEM Partnerships (MAN, etc.) | Jim Granger channel, established digital inventory adoption |
| **#4** | Marine Transportation | Lower urgency, but validated need |

### Go-to-Market Approach

| Phase | Focus | Target Revenue |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Phase 1 (Year 1)** | Pilot projects with validated contacts | $300-600K |
| **Phase 2 (Year 2-3)** | Reference customers → early majority | $5-15M |
| **Phase 3 (Year 4-5)** | Platform scaling, international expansion | $50-75M |
