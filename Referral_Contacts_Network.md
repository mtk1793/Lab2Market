## Follow-Up Email Templates

### Template 1: Request Introduction from Darren Wood

**Subject:** Thank You + Introduction Request (Kraken Robotics, Poly Unity, CMA)

Hi Darren,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me yesterday. Your insights on obsolescence, lead times, and inventory challenges were incredibly valuable, and I really appreciate your honesty about where AM makes sense (custom fabricated parts, R&D prototyping) vs. where it doesn't (electrical components).

You mentioned a few contacts who might be helpful as I continue validating this concept:

1. **Robert Hines (Kraken Robotics)** - You said they're "the perfect type of people cause they're making stuff" and that AM could be valuable for their R&D and custom AUV components.

2. **Mark Gillingham (Poly Unity)** - You mentioned he's "the guy to talk to" and runs the AMC. I'd love to explore potential collaboration (not competition!) with Poly Unity.

3. **David Hare (CMA)** - You said he's "linked up with everybody" and could point me in other directions.

Would you be comfortable making warm introductions to any or all of these contacts? I'm happy to draft an intro email that you can forward, or I can follow up directly if you prefer to just share their contact info.

Thanks again for your time and for offering to help connect me with your network. It's incredibly generous and will make a huge difference in validating this concept.

Best regards,  
Michael Kiasari

### Template 2: Follow-Up with Adam Chubbs (Engineered Intelligence Partnership)

**Subject:** Follow-Up: Engineered Intelligence + Digital Inventory Partnership?

Hi Adam,

Thank you for the great conversation yesterday. Your insights on remote power systems, Arctic logistics, and AI-driven asset intelligence were exactly what I needed to hear.

I'm particularly intrigued by your work with **Engineered Intelligence** and the "Engine" platform. You mentioned that utilities have "trolls of maintenance data and asset condition data" that are siloed and not integrated - and that the push now is to use AI to predict failures, overloads, and capacity issues.

This seems like a perfect fit for what I'm working on with digital inventory and additive manufacturing. Here's the potential synergy I see:

**Closed-Loop System:**
1. **Engineered Intelligence** predicts part failures based on asset health data
2. **AddManuChain** provides digital inventory of AM parts to fulfill those predictions
3. **Result**: Predictive maintenance + just-in-time parts delivery = reduced inventory costs + improved reliability

Would you be open to exploring a partnership between Engineered Intelligence and AddManuChain? I'd love to:
- See a demo of the Engine platform
- Discuss integration points (API, data formats, workflow)
- Develop a joint value proposition for utilities

Let me know if you'd be interested in a follow-up conversation. I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks again for your time and insights!

Best regards,  
Michael Kiasari

## Notes & Observations

### Network Effects:
- **Poly Unity is the hub**: Multiple interviewees have mentioned Poly Unity - Mark Gillingham is the ecosystem gatekeeper
- **Memorial University keeps appearing**: Mike Paulin (Adjunct Professor), Megan Clarke, C-CORE connection
- **St. John's is the center**: Kraken Robotics, Poly Unity, Memorial, offshore operators - all in St. John's

### Strategic Insights:
- **Warm introductions are GOLD**: Darren and Adam both offered to make introductions - this is 10x more valuable than cold outreach
- **Partnership > Competition**: Poly Unity is not a competitor - they're a potential partner (different market segments)
- **AI integration is a differentiator**: Engineered Intelligence partnership could be a game-changer

### Risks & Challenges:
- **Poly Unity relationship**: Need to position as partner, not competitor - emphasize complementary strengths
- **Follow-up timing**: Need to act quickly on these introductions before they go cold
- **Overcommitting**: 6 new contacts + existing interviews - need to prioritize ruthlessly
