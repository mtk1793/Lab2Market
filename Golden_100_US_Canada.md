**Subject:** Research Inquiry: Digital Inventories for West White Rose Operations

Dear Mr. Osborne,

My name is Mahmoud Kiasari, and I am a PhD researcher at Dalhousie University conducting industry research through the Lab2Market program.

Given your extensive experience managing drilling operations for both Husky Energy and now Cenovus's West White Rose Project, I am particularly interested in your perspective on "last-mile" logistics for remote Atlantic offshore assets. My research focuses on how Additive Manufacturing and Digital Inventories can solve the spare parts challenge—specifically, how shifting from physical warehousing to on-demand digital spares can increase operational resilience for harsh-environment drilling programs.

I am not selling anything; I am purely in learning mode to ensure my research aligns with the actual operational constraints you face. Could I steal 15 minutes of your time for a brief reality check?
