# IRAP Funding Outreach Guide - AddManuChain

The National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP) provides advice, connections, and funding to help Canadian small and medium-sized businesses increase their innovation capacity and take ideas to market. 

To secure funding, you do not just "apply"—you must first build a relationship with an **Industrial Technology Advisor (ITA)** who will guide you to the right programs and help you build a project proposal.

## Steps to Contact IRAP

### 1. Verify Basic Eligibility
Before reaching out, ensure AddManuChain and your company meet the baseline criteria:
*   Be a registered, for-profit small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) in Canada.
*   Have fewer than 500 full-time equivalent employees.
*   Plan to pursue growth and profit by developing and commercializing innovative, technology-driven new or improved products, services, or processes in Canada.

### 2. Prepare Your "Elevator Pitch" Materials
Be ready to clearly communicate your startup's status. Have the following prepared:
*   A concise description of the **AddManuChain** project (what it is, the problem it solves).
*   Your target market and insights from your **Lab2Market customer discovery** (e.g., your 50+ interviews with offshore energy, aerospace, and marine gatekeepers).
*   Your business model and commercialization plan.
*   The technical challenges or R&D remaining that you need funding to accomplish.

### 3. Contact IRAP to Be Assigned an ITA
You have two main ways to initiate contact:
*   **Direct Phone Call (Fastest):** Call the IRAP toll-free number at **1-877-994-4727**. A representative will ask you a few questions about your business to connect you with the most appropriate local ITA (likely in the Atlantic region or wherever your company is based).
*   **Through Existing Connections:** Since you are in Lab2Market, ask your mentors (e.g., Dwayne Hopkins, Carol, or the L2M regional directors) if they have a direct contact or can make a warm introduction to an ITA who covers ocean tech or additive manufacturing.

### 4. The Initial ITA Meeting
Once connected, the ITA will likely ask for an introductory call or meeting. 
*   **Goal:** The ITA wants to understand your project's technical merit, market potential, and your team's capability.
*   Treat this meeting like a pitch, but be transparent about where you need help (IRAP funds technical development/innovation, not just general marketing or operations).
*   **Outcome:** If the ITA sees a fit, they will invite you to submit a funding proposal. **The ITA acts as your advocate** inside IRAP.

### 5. Develop the Project Proposal
Work closely with your ITA to develop a detailed project proposal, which outlines the specific R&D tasks, timelines, costs, and expected outcomes that IRAP will co-fund.

**Body:**

Hi [ITA Name or "IRAP Intake Team"],

My name is [Your Name], and I am the [Your Title, e.g., Founder / Project Lead] of AddManuChain, an early-stage startup focused on bringing secure digital inventory and localized additive manufacturing to the marine, offshore energy, and aerospace sectors. 

We are currently participating in the Lab2Market program. Through over 50 customer discovery interviews with key industry operators (such as Irving Shipbuilding, Precision ADM, and major offshore drilling contractors), we have identified a critical need and validated our proposed solution for mitigating supply chain disruptions via certified 3D printing.

As we transition from market validation to technical development, we are looking to understand how NRC IRAP might support our upcoming R&D efforts. Our next phase involves [briefly mention your core technical challenge, e.g., developing the secure block-chain prototype / building our initial supply chain software architecture].

We would appreciate the opportunity to schedule a brief introductory call to share our progress, discuss our technical roadmap, and explore if AddManuChain aligns with IRAP's funding and advisory support.

Are you available for a 15-minute call sometime next week?

Thank you for your time,
