## SLIDE 4 — The Problem (Part 1): Supply Chain Difficulty

**Core Problem Statement:**
> Reliable spare parts supply is critical for remote industries — but remote industries have difficult access to bulky metallic spare part inventory.

### Current Delivery Options & Their Limitations

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Helicopter (Chopper)** | Fast | Costly; Light loads only |
| **Supply Vessel** | Cheaper; Can carry heavy loads | Very slow |

Neither option is ideal — there is no fast, affordable, high-capacity delivery mechanism for remote sites.

### Consequences of a Damaged Critical Part

When a critical metal component fails at a remote site, the downstream effects are severe:

1. **Process Shutdown** — Operations halt entirely
2. **Costly Downtime** — Every hour offline translates to significant revenue loss
3. **Safety Concerns** — Equipment failures in offshore environments pose serious risks to personnel and infrastructure

---

## SLIDE 5 — The Problem (Part 2): Scale of Inventory Costs

**Root Cause:**
E&P (Exploration & Production) companies are forced to maintain large, costly inventories of rarely used parts because of long supply lead times and the critical nature of certain components. This creates a massive financial burden.

### Industry Evidence

| Statistic | Source |
|---|---|
| **Up to $88 million** in annual downtime costs | GE Oil & Gas |
| **80% of physical inventory** (worth $4.5 billion) is unused | Head of AM Strategy, Equinor |

> These figures illustrate that the status quo — physical inventory stocked "just in case" — is both financially and operationally unsustainable for remote industries.

---

## SLIDE 6 — The Solution: On-Demand Digital Inventory (Overview)

**The Shift:**
Move from **physical inventory** → **digital inventory**

**The Principle:**
Print parts **on-site** and **just-on-time** instead of storing them **just-in-case**

This means remote facilities only need to store digital design files rather than thousands of physical metal components. When a part breaks, it is printed on-site using the stored digital blueprint — dramatically reducing both inventory overhead and downtime.

---

## SLIDE 7 — The Solution: Just-on-Time vs. Just-in-Case Philosophy

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Category | Just-in-Case (OEM Model) | Just-on-Time (Alma-Tech Model) |
|---|---|---|
| **Lead Time** | Large lead time | Shorter lead time |
| **Warehousing** | Large inventory carrying costs | Downsized warehousing |
| **Design Flexibility** | No design flexibility | Flexible designing |
| **Worn Parts** | 100% replacement required | Worn parts can be repaired |
| **Carbon Footprint** | Considerable CO₂ from transportation | Lesser CO₂ due to reduced transportation |
| **Inventory Waste** | High — due to obsolescence | Low — parts made only when needed |

**Summary:** Alma-Tech's just-on-time approach addresses every major weakness of the traditional OEM supply model, while also delivering environmental benefits through reduced transportation.

## SLIDE 8 — Market Size

### Market Segmentation (Based on Drilling Rigs)

| Market Level | Scope | Number of Rigs | Market Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TM (Target Market)** | Canada | 500 drilling rigs | **$117 million** |
| **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)** | North America | 1,500 drilling rigs | **$350 million** |
| **TAM (Total Addressable Market)** | Global | 6,000 drilling rigs | **$1.4 billion** |

### Revenue Model Assumptions (Per Rig)

| Revenue Stream | Amount |
|---|---|
| Initial set-up charge per rig | $90,000 |
| Monthly support charge per rig | $12,000/month |
| **Total revenue per rig per year** | **$234,000** |

> *Calculation: $90,000 (setup) + ($12,000 × 12 months) = $234,000/year per rig*

## SLIDE 9 — Ecosystem (Partners, Suppliers, Competitors)

Alma-Tech sits at the **center of a multi-stakeholder ecosystem**, managing relationships and value flows across multiple parties:

### Suppliers (provide inputs to Alma-Tech)

| Entity | Relationship | Also a Competitor? |
|---|---|---|
| **3D-Printer Producers** | Supply 3D printers; receive money | Yes |
| **Part IP Owners (Designers)** | Supply digital part files; receive royalties/money | No |
| **Digital Inventory Software Developers** | Supply software services; receive money | Yes |

### Partners (collaborate with Alma-Tech)

| Entity | Relationship |
|---|---|
| **3D Printing Centers** | Receive 3D-printed real parts; receive money |
| **Certification Bodies** | Provide certification stamps; receive money |

### Customers

| Entity | What They Receive | What They Pay For |
|---|---|---|
| **Part End Users (Remote Locations)** | Services, Consulting, Training, Information | Money |

### Competitors

| Entity | Why They Compete |
|---|---|
| **3D-Printer Producers** | Can sell directly to end users |
| **Digital Inventory Software Developers** | Can build their own platforms |
| **OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers)** | Provide conventional part supply with established relationships |

---

## SLIDE 10 — Competitive Analysis: Legacy Supply Chain (OEMs)

The primary incumbent competitor is **Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)** — companies that currently supply spare parts through traditional manufacturing and logistics channels.

### OEM Strengths (Alma-Tech's Challenges)

| Strength | Impact on Alma-Tech |
|---|---|
| Established business case | Customer inertia — why switch? |
| Long and lasting relationships with end-users | High switching cost for customers |
| **Already hold Certification Stamps** | **This is Alma-Tech's current main challenge** |

### OEM Weaknesses (Alma-Tech's Opportunities)

| Weakness | Alma-Tech's Advantage |
|---|---|
| Long lead times | On-demand printing eliminates wait |
| No design flexibility | Alma-Tech enables design iteration |
| High carbon footprint | Reduced transportation = lower emissions |

> ⚠️ **Key Risk Flagged by Founders:** The certification stamps held by OEMs represent the single biggest barrier to entry. Printed parts used in offshore oil & gas must meet strict safety and regulatory standards. Without equivalent certifications, Alma-Tech cannot legally supply parts in many contexts.

## SLIDE 11 — How the Product/Service Works

The Alma-Tech solution has two interconnected components:

### Software Component — Digital Inventory Platform

A centralized digital platform connecting four key stakeholders:

```
                    [Certification Authorities]
                              |
    [Part End Users] — [Digital Inventory] — [OEMs / IP Owners]
                              |
                    [3D Printing Centers]
```

| Stakeholder | Role in Platform |
|---|---|
| **Certification Authorities** | Validate and approve digital part designs for safety compliance |
| **OEMs (IP Owners)** | License their part designs into the digital inventory |
| **3D Printing Centers** | Execute print jobs when parts are ordered |
| **Part End Users** | Browse and order parts on-demand from remote locations |

### Hardware Component

On-site metal 3D printing equipment deployed directly at remote industrial locations (specific hardware specifications not detailed in the deck).

## Summary: Strengths, Weaknesses & Key Risks

### Strengths

- **Deep technical credibility** — founders are PhD candidates with 9 published papers backing their core technology
- **Real, quantified problem** — $88M downtime costs and $4.5B in unused inventory from credible industry sources (GE Oil & Gas, Equinor)
- **Large addressable market** — $1.4B TAM globally across 6,000 drilling rigs
- **Full end-to-end service model** — differentiates from hardware-only or software-only competitors
- **Environmental angle** — reduced CO₂ footprint adds ESG appeal to pitch
- **Strong support network** — backed by Emera IdeaHub, CleanTech Commons, and industry advisors with direct Oil & Gas experience

### Weaknesses / Gaps in the Deck

- **Certification challenge is unresolved** — the deck identifies this as the "main challenge" but provides no clear plan or timeline to address it
- **No funding ask specified** — the deck does not state how much capital is being raised or at what valuation
- **No financial projections** — revenue forecasts, burn rate, and path to profitability are absent
- **Hardware detail missing** — the hardware component slide appears incomplete with no product images or specifications
- **No go-to-market strategy** — no detail on first customer acquisition, sales strategy, or pilot programs
- **OEM partnership model unclear** — it's not explained how Alma-Tech will convince OEMs to license their IP into the digital inventory platform (a potential chicken-and-egg problem)
- **Regulatory pathway** — beyond identifying the certification gap, there is no roadmap for navigating the complex regulatory environment in offshore Oil & Gas
