# Alma-Tech Pitch Deck — Detailed Breakdown

## 1. Company Overview
**Alma-Tech** is a startup focused on **metal 3D printing for remote industries**, particularly offshore Oil & Gas. Founded by two PhD candidates in Materials Engineering at Dalhousie University — **Alireza Vahedi Nemani (CEO)** and **Mahya Ghaffari (CTO)**.

Their core value proposition: enable **on-demand, on-site 3D printing of spare metal parts**, eliminating the need for massive physical inventories at remote sites.

## 2. The Problem

Remote industrial sites (especially offshore oil rigs) face a fundamental supply chain dilemma:

- **Helicopters** can deliver fast but are expensive and limited to light loads
- **Supply vessels** can handle heavy loads cheaply but are very slow

When a critical metal part fails, the only options are costly and slow. The consequences are severe: process shutdowns, expensive downtime, and serious safety risks.

The financial scale of this problem is staggering. GE Oil & Gas reported **up to $88 million in annual downtime costs**, while Equinor's Head of AM Strategy noted that **80% of their $4.5 billion physical inventory sits unused** — parts stockpiled "just in case" that rarely or never get used.

## 3. The Solution — On-Demand Digital Inventory

Alma-Tech proposes shifting from a **"just-in-case" philosophy** (OEM model) to a **"just-on-time" philosophy** (Alma-Tech model):

| Just-in-Case (OEMs) | Just-on-Time (Alma-Tech) |
|---|---|
| Long lead times | Shorter lead times |
| Large inventory costs | Downsized warehousing |
| No design flexibility | Flexible designing |
| 100% part replacement | Worn parts can be repaired |
| High CO₂ footprint | Reduced CO₂ footprint |

Instead of shipping heavy physical parts, companies maintain a **digital library of part designs** and print them on-site when needed.

## 4. What Makes Alma-Tech Different

Unlike pure 3D printer manufacturers or software vendors, Alma-Tech offers **end-to-end implementation**, covering:
- **Assessment** of which parts are printable
- **Adoption** planning
- **Integration** into existing workflows
- **Training** of on-site personnel
- **Ongoing maintenance**

This full-service model is their key competitive differentiator — they're not just selling a printer, they're selling a complete operational transformation.

---

## 5. Market Size

They segment the market around **drilling rigs** as their unit of analysis:

- **Canada (Target Market):** 500 rigs → $117M market
- **North America (SAM):** 1,500 rigs → $350M market
- **Global (TAM):** 6,000 rigs → **$1.4 billion market**

Their revenue model per rig: **$90,000 initial setup** + **$12,000/month** support = ~$234,000 per rig per year.

## 6. Ecosystem & Competitive Landscape

The deck maps out a multi-stakeholder ecosystem where Alma-Tech sits at the center:

- **Suppliers:** 3D printer producers, Part IP owners/designers, Digital inventory software developers
- **Partners:** 3D printing centers, Certification bodies
- **Competitors:** 3D printer producers (partial overlap), Digital inventory software developers, and most significantly — **OEMs**

**OEMs are their biggest competitive threat** because they have established customer relationships and, critically, already hold the **certification stamps** required to supply parts to regulated industries. Alma-Tech explicitly calls this out as their **"current main challenge."**

---

## 7. How the Product Works

The platform has two components:

**Software — Digital Inventory Platform** that connects:
- Certification authorities
- OEMs (IP owners of part designs)
- 3D printing centers
- Part end users at remote locations

**Hardware** — The actual metal 3D printing equipment deployed on-site (the hardware side of the slide appears to have an image that wasn't fully described in the deck).

---

## 8. Technology & Milestones

The founders have strong academic credentials with **9 published research papers** backing their technology. Their roadmap shows:

**Completed (Jan 2019 – Feb 2021):**
- Plain carbon steels (ship bow plates, pipelines, structural components)
- Stainless steels (reactor piping, risers, cyclones, overhead condensers)

**Current (July 2021 – Feb 2022):**
- PH Martensitic stainless steel for more complex applications — fractionators, reactor nozzles, pumps, etc.

**Future (2022–2023):**
- Non-ferrous alloys: aluminum, copper, nickel, titanium

Their near-term priorities are proof of concept validation, customer trust-building, parts quality evaluation, and obtaining certification stamps.

---

## 9. Team

**Founders** — both PhD candidates in Materials Engineering at Dalhousie University, giving them deep technical credibility.

**Advisors:**
- **Dr. Ali Nasiri** — Technical advisor, Assistant Professor & Canada Research Chair in Ocean Engineering at Dalhousie
- **Harsimran Malhi** — Business advisor with 7 years at Halliburton and an Oxford MBA

**Support Network** includes mentors from Emera IdeaHub, CleanTech Commons, and experienced business consultants — suggesting they're incubator-backed with strong institutional support.

## Key Strengths & Weaknesses of the Pitch

**Strengths:** The problem is real and well-quantified with credible industry sources. The market size is substantial. The founders have genuine technical depth (9 publications). The end-to-end service model is a smart differentiation strategy.

**Weaknesses/Gaps:** The certification challenge is a significant barrier they've identified but haven't fully solved. The hardware side of the product slide appears incomplete. There's no financial projection, funding ask amount, or go-to-market timeline shown. The deck also doesn't address how they'll convince OEMs to license their IP for the digital inventory platform — a chicken-and-egg problem.
