3,David Waldbillig (InnoTech Alberta),2026-01-28,Mahmoud Kiasari,"Principal Engineer at InnoTech Alberta. Revealed competitive landscape (Fieldnode, Baker Hughes, Pelagus). Key insight: AM currently used for education/testing, not production. Trust gap varies by stakeholder. Post-processing (coatings) is critical. Power generation is underserved market. Canada lagging behind US/Singapore in on-site AM adoption.","VP.9 - Real-Time Communication Platform, VP.12 - Certification Body Decision Support, VP.14 - Transparent Pricing/Budget Pre-Qualification",,"VP.1 - Find Certified Facilities Within 48 Hours (only for low-risk parts), VP.2 - Real-Time Capacity Dashboard, KR.1 - IoT/AI Quality System Integration","New Hypotheses: H50 (Low-Risk Part Categorization System), H51 (Post-Processing Service Network), H52 (Reverse Engineering Integration), H53 (Predictive Maintenance API Integration). Major competitive intel on Fieldnode."
4,Jason Power (Noble Corporation),2026-01-28,Mahmoud Kiasari,"Senior leadership at Noble Corporation, moving to VP Business Development at Valaris. Critical strategic pivots revealed: (1) Target integrators (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes) not operators, (2) AI inventory optimization is bigger opportunity than AM initially, (3) Predictive maintenance + supply chain integration is unmet need (#1 opportunity), (4) Risk categorization is THE primary decision factor. Downtime cost: $500K-$1M/day justifies $30-50M inventory.","VP.14 - Transparent Pricing/Budget Pre-Qualification","VP.1 - Find Certified Facilities Within 48 Hours (wrong target - operators buy from integrators, don't search for manufacturers), H27 - Track Every Part (not mentioned as priority)",,"FUNDAMENTAL BUSINESS MODEL PIVOT: Changed target customer from operators to integrators/OEMs. Value prop shift: AI-first, AM-second approach. Jason willing to provide referrals to HMH and other integrators."
5,Sean Morgan (Atlantic XL),2026-01-31,Mahmoud Kiasari,"Director of Operations at Atlantic XL (one of only commercial metal AM facilities in Atlantic Canada). CRITICAL VALIDATION: Atlantic XL acts as BOTH AM facility AND procurement agency - validates two-sided marketplace model. Major insights: (1) Post-COVID stock depletion - 'nobody carries stock anymore', (2) Obsolescence + lead time drive adoption (not innovation), (3) Geographic isolation amplifies pain (Newfoundland logistics), (4) Predictive maintenance + digital inventory integration - Sean independently described entire AddManuChain vision unprompted!","CS.1 - Manufacturers Need Certified Local Suppliers, CS.2 - Facilities Have Idle Capacity, CS.3 - Labs Need Digital Compliance, CS.4 - OEMs Want Distributed Manufacturing, CJ.1 - Source Certified Parts Quickly, CJ.2 - Fill Machine Capacity, CJ.3 - Process Certifications Efficiently, CP.1 - Weeks Wasted Finding Facilities, CP.2 - Expensive Distant Suppliers, CP.3 - Certification Proof Difficulty, CP.5 - High CAC Kills Margins, CP.6 - Paper-Based Chaos, CG.1 - Find Facilities in Minutes, CG.2 - Cut Shipping 40-60%, CG.4 - Maximize Machine Revenue, CG.5 - Reduce CAC by 50%+, VP.1 - Find Facilities in Minutes, VP.4 - Qualified Client Pipeline, VP.9 - Real-Time Communication Platform, VP.10 - Demand Forecasting & Pipeline Visibility, VP.11 - Quality-Over-Quantity Matching, VP.13 - Multi-Role Collaboration Workspaces",,"","New Hypotheses: NH.1 (Post-COVID Stock Depletion), NH.2 (Obsolescence Primary Driver), NH.3 (Lead Time Emergency Accelerates Adoption), NH.4 (Geographic Isolation), NH.5 (Predictive Maintenance + Digital Inventory Integration - MASSIVE validation), NH.6 (AM Adoption Evolution: Emergency → Comfort → Innovation), NH.7 (Certification is Primary Gatekeeper). Competitive intel: Fieldnode and Pelagus 3D exist but haven't gained traction - 'solid opportunity' remains. Lloyd's Register qualification expected within 2 weeks."
6,John Lidstone (Atlantic XL),2026-01-31,Mahmoud Kiasari,"Engineer In Training at Atlantic XL. Provides ground-truth technical perspective vs. Sean's strategic view. Key insights: Feasibility + cost drive AM acceptance (round parts = machining, complex/cast = AM). Digital inventory can reduce lead time from months to weeks. OEM IP release is critical blocker - need AI patent search or OEM partnerships. Validates user adoption perspective (would he actually use the platform day-to-day?).","","","","New Hypotheses: NH.8 (Feasibility + Cost Drive AM Acceptance), NH.9 (Digital Inventory Reduces Lead Time), NH.10 (OEM IP Release Critical Blocker). Important for UX validation and early adopter profile assessment."
7,Dr. Priti Wanjara (NRC) / Fanny Charreteur (CQFA),2026-01-31,Mahmoud Kiasari,"Dr. Wanjara referred Fanny Charreteur at CQFA (Carrefour québécois de la fabrication additive). CQFA is Quebec's AM ecosystem hub, manages services, consultant networks, and Sr&ED reporting expertise. Partnership opportunity: CQFA + AddManuChain collaboration could provide instant access to Quebec AM facilities, leverage government funding, and create pilot partnership.","","","","New Hypothesis: NH.11 (CQFA as Quebec AM Ecosystem Gateway). Strategic partnership model validated - regional AM hubs provide ecosystem access and funding expertise."
