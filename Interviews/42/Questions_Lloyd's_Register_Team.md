## INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (9 Total)

### **SECTION A: Commercial & Ecosystem Integration** (Dave Whitehouse)

**Q1. [Dave] Partnership Pathways & Client Demand**
> *"Dave, you manage multi-disciplinary technical teams and have worked extensively with government agencies like the Royal Canadian Navy and NRCan. From a commercial perspective, what's driving current demand for certification services in the marine/offshore AM space? Are you seeing operators asking for AM certification pathways, or is this still too early-stage?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- What types of organizations are most receptive?
- What's stopping broader adoption from a commercial/business case perspective?
- How does Lloyd's Register typically engage with new technology platforms or service providers?

---

**Q2. [Dave] Project Management & Timeline Expectations**
> *"Based on your experience managing technical projects, if an offshore operator wanted to certify their first AM part for marine deployment — let's say a non-structural component like a valve housing or instrumentation bracket — what's a realistic timeline and project structure? What are the major milestones and pain points?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- What percentage of projects fail or stall at specific stages?
- How do you manage cross-functional coordination (design, testing, documentation)?
- What role could a digital platform play in streamlining this process?

---

**Q3. [Dave] Government & Defense Sector Opportunities**
> *"You've worked with defense clients (Navy, DRDC). We're hearing strong signals that the Canadian Navy's AM program with Thales is struggling to get parts approved despite significant investment. From a commercial manager's perspective, what would it take for Lloyd's Register to support a 'fast-track' certification pathway for defense applications? Is there appetite for pilot programs?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- Are defense/government clients budgeted differently for R&D certification?
- Would Lloyd's Register co-invest in pilot projects for strategic markets?
- How do you balance risk vs. opportunity with emerging technologies?

---

### **SECTION B: Offshore Energy Certification Strategy** (Trevor Butler)

**Q4. [Trevor] Harsh Environment Certification for Arctic/Offshore AM**
> *"Trevor, you specialize in certifying offshore installations in harsh environments across Eastern Canada and the Northeastern USA. When we talk to Arctic and offshore operators, they describe supply chain challenges — 10-day emergency deliveries, air freight costs in winter, N+2 redundancy for critical spares. If AM could produce certified parts on-site or regionally, what are the **actual technical barriers** versus **perceived regulatory barriers**?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- Are there specific harsh environment factors (corrosion, thermal cycling, ice loads) that complicate AM certification?
- How do you handle "temporary" or "bridge" parts with shorter design life?
- What testing/inspection protocols are mandatory for offshore AM parts?

---

**Q5. [Trevor] Lloyd's Register View on "Pre-Certified Parts Libraries"**
> *"We've heard from ExxonMobil and Equinor that they're exploring digital inventory — sending CAD files to certified AM facilities. One concept we're testing is a **pre-certified parts library**: the first customer pays full certification cost, but subsequent customers can order the same geometry/material/process combo without re-certifying. Does Lloyd's Register have a framework for this? What would make it viable?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- How do you ensure traceability (powder batch, machine calibration, operator qualification)?
- Would Lloyd's Register issue a "type approval" for AM designs?
- What's the difference between certifying a part vs. certifying a process?

---

**Q6. [Trevor] Offshore Energy Transition & AM Opportunity**
> *"You work across traditional hydrocarbons and renewable/transitional energy. Are you seeing different AM adoption rates or certification appetites between legacy oil & gas operators versus wind/tidal/hydrogen projects? Is there a 'greenfield advantage' where new energy projects are more willing to adopt AM from day one?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- Which energy sector is pushing hardest for AM innovation?
- Are renewable energy projects less constrained by legacy certification frameworks?
- What role does sovereign resilience (local manufacturing, Arctic independence) play in certification priorities?

---

### **SECTION C: AM Technical Standards & Certification Mechanics** (Adam Saxty)

**Q7. [Adam] The "Certification Gap" — What Actually Needs to Be Certified?**
> *"Adam, you're Lloyd's Register's Lead AM Technologist with deep expertise in welding metallurgy and inspection. When operators say 'AM certification is too hard,' what are they actually struggling with? We've heard it's not just the part — it's the machine, the powder, the operator, the lab, the process. Can you break down what Lloyd's Register actually certifies, and where the bottlenecks are?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- Can you certify the **process** once, or does every part need individual certification?
- How do you handle material property variations (powder batch consistency, post-processing)?
- What inspection techniques work for AM (CT scanning, ultrasonic, dye penetrant)?

---

**Q8. [Adam] "Aerospace First" Strategy — Does It Transfer to Marine?**
> *"We've heard from industry advisors that pursuing **aerospace certification first** is strategic — if you can meet aerospace standards (FAA, EASA), then marine and offshore certifications become easier by comparison. As someone who bridges naval shipbuilding and AM, do you agree? Would a part certified for F-35 supply chain be fast-tracked for marine deployment?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- Are Lloyd's Register standards tougher or lighter than aerospace?
- Which material (PEEK, Ti-64, Inconel 718, stainless steel) would you prioritize for marine AM?
- Can Lloyd's Register leverage aerospace certifications, or are they siloed?

---

**Q9. [Adam] "Certification-as-a-Service" Business Model Viability**
> *"Our hypothesis is that **operators won't do the certification work** — it's too complex, cross-disciplinary, and time-consuming. But if a platform said: 'We handle Lloyd's Register certification end-to-end — you just order the certified part,' would that change adoption? As the AM lead, would Lloyd's Register work with a third-party platform to streamline this, or do you prefer direct client relationships?"*

**Follow-ups:**
- What would a "turnkey certification service" need to include (design review, testing, documentation, audits)?
- How do you ensure quality control if you're not directly managing the AM facility?
- Would Lloyd's Register co-brand or white-label certification services through a platform?

## WARM-UP / ICE BREAKER

*"Thank you all for taking the time — Mike Paulin at C-CORE spoke highly of Trevor's offshore expertise, and when I saw Adam's role as Lloyd's Register's Lead AM Technologist, I knew this was the right team to speak with. I'm at Dalhousie doing customer discovery for a supply chain intelligence platform focused on offshore, Arctic, and defense. We've heard from 40+ interviews that certification is THE barrier to AM adoption — not the technology itself. So I'm here to learn: What does Lloyd's Register see as the path forward? And is there a role for a platform that streamlines the certification process?"*
