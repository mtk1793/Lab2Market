## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

Dr. Stephen Ryan is building **the closest parallel to AddManuChain** encountered in the entire discovery program — but in the healthcare sector. PolyUnity:
- **Prints replacement parts for hospital equipment** with an ISO 13485-compliant quality management system
- Manages the tension between **move-fast startup culture and rigorous QMS documentation** — exactly the challenge AddManuChain faces
- Has a live platform (**i3d.health**) that stores AM workflows and distributes them to healthcare organizations
- Has navigated **OEM IP and liability** questions when printing parts for hospital devices
- Has live **government and hospital procurement** relationships (Eastern Health, CHEO, OBIO, CAN Health Network)

This is a **peer founder conversation**, not a traditional customer interview. The goal is to learn from their model, understand where they hit walls, and explore whether there is a cross-sector collaboration or shared learnings opportunity.

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

---

### Q1 — The PolyUnity model: how does it actually work?

> *"Stephen, PolyUnity is printing replacement parts for hospital equipment under ISO 13485 — which is extraordinary. Can you walk me through the actual workflow? When a hospital identifies a broken piece of equipment and decides they want a 3D-printed replacement — how does that part go from broken to certified and back in service? Who does what, and where does i3d.health sit in that chain?"*

**Follow-ups:** How many hospitals are actively on the platform? Do hospitals store their own part files, or does PolyUnity maintain the digital library? Who certifies the part as safe to reinstall — PolyUnity, the hospital's clinical engineering team, or someone else?

---

### Q2 — The OEM IP and liability question: how did you solve it?

> *"One of the biggest structural barriers we keep hearing in our interviews — across oil & gas, defence, and manufacturing — is OEM IP and liability. If you print a replacement part for a piece of hospital equipment, the OEM didn't make that part, so who owns the liability if it fails? You've been operating under ISO 13485 for years. How did you resolve the OEM relationship — did you work around them, get agreements with them, or focus on a category of parts where the OEM wasn't a blocker?"*

**Follow-ups:** Are there categories of hospital equipment where OEMs are cooperative vs. litigious? Has a liability or IP challenge ever threatened the business or killed a specific part project? We've found in other sectors that **obsolete parts** (where OEM no longer supports them) are the "low-hanging fruit" — is that true in healthcare too?

---

### Q3 — The QMS and certification experience: what does it actually cost to operate under ISO 13485?

> *"Your developer's LinkedIn post was fascinating — the tension between 'move-fast' startup culture and ISO 13485 documentation requirements. For someone building a platform in a regulated manufacturing sector — what did it actually take to get to ISO 13485 compliance? How long, how expensive, and what was the thing that almost broke you? And now that you have it, has it opened doors that would have been impossible without it?"*

**Follow-ups:** Did certification help with hospital procurement decisions or government funding? How does PolyUnity handle re-certification when a printing facility or material changes? Could that certification model be licensed or transferred to facilities in other sectors?

---

### Q4 — Government procurement: what actually moved the needle?

> *"When a hospital's procurement team looks at a 3D-printed replacement part for equipment — what is the single biggest question they ask before they say yes? Is it about the material certification, the printing facility's qualifications, liability if the part fails, or something else entirely? And from your experience with Eastern Health and CHEO — what specifically about how PolyUnity presented the AM solution got past that barrier, where others couldn't?"*

**Follow-ups:** How did the CAN Health Network specifically accelerate adoption? Did federal vs. provincial procurement behave differently? Is the procurement lesson transferable to non-healthcare sectors (defence, oil & gas, maritime)?

---

### Q5 — AI + AM: what are you actually using AI for, and what's hype?

> *"You just completed AI for Manufacturers certification, and your platform is clearly AI-adjacent — you describe i3d.health as the 'Thingiverse for Healthcare.' In practice, what role does AI actually play in your workflow today — is it in part selection, quality prediction, matching hospitals to print facilities, or something else entirely? And where do you think the AI + AM combination creates the most defensible value that a pure logistics or marketplace player can't replicate?"*

**Follow-ups:** Have you experimented with AI for predictive maintenance or flagging which hospital equipment is most likely to need a printed replacement? Where did AI disappointing you — what didn't work?

---

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

---

### B1 — The "Thingiverse for Healthcare" vision vs. defensibility

> *"Once a hospital uses PolyUnity to qualify and print a part — what stops them from going directly to the print shop next time, cutting you out? What keeps them coming back to the platform?"*

---

### B2 — Cross-sector learnings and referrals

> *"You've been doing this in healthcare for 7+ years — longer than almost anyone in the Canadian AM ecosystem. Three asks: First, what is the one thing you wish someone had told you in Year 1 about building a regulated AM platform that you had to figure out the hard way? Second, given that our sectors — healthcare equipment vs. industrial/defence/maritime — have overlapping AM certification and IP challenges, is there a collaboration or knowledge-sharing opportunity here? Third, who else in the Canadian AM or medtech ecosystem should I be talking to that I'm probably missing?"*

## KEY HYPOTHESES TO VALIDATE

| # | Hypothesis | Question |
|---|------------|----------|
| H1 | Obsolete hospital equipment parts (OEM no longer supports) = healthcare's "low-hanging fruit" equivalent | Q2 |
| H2 | ISO 13485 certification creates procurement trust that unlocks institutional buyers | Q3 |
| H3 | Canadian government procurement (CAN Health, OBIO) can be navigated — learnable playbook | Q4 |
| H4 | AI in AM is real but specific — not a generic "AI layer" on top of a marketplace | Q5 |
| H5 | Digital inventory platform defensibility comes from the certification/QMS layer, not the marketplace itself | B1 |

## CONTEXT TO SHARE WITH DR. RYAN

- AddManuChain: Canadian platform for digital spare parts inventory + AM production + certification-as-a-service — targeting oil & gas, maritime, and defence sectors
- We're 53 interviews in — including Lloyd's Register, Irving Shipbuilding, Aker Solutions (Hebron), Equinor, Canadian Navy (Lee Vessey / Thales), and Atlantic XL (first LR-certified AM facility in the Americas)
- We are grappling with the exact same structural barriers Stephen has faced: OEM IP, liability, certification bodies, and procurement
- Atlantic XL (Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility, St. John's NL) is our anchor manufacturing partner — there may be a geographic overlap worth exploring

## IMPORTANT NOTES ON FRAMING

**This is a peer conversation, not a discovery interview.** Stephen is a founder, not a buyer. Lead with genuine respect for what he's built and curiosity about his model — not with AddManuChain's pitch.

**Ask about failures, not just wins.** The most valuable insights from parallel founders come from what broke, not what worked. The ISO 13485 journey, the OEM IP battles, the procurement near-misses — that's the gold.

**The QMS/certification layer is the overlap.** Both PolyUnity and AddManuChain are trying to build trust infrastructure (the "certification as a service" layer) that makes AM trustworthy for regulated buyers. This is the real conversation.

**Don't over-pitch.** End by asking what *he* needs, not what AddManuChain can offer. Offers of collaboration should come naturally from the conversation, not be pushed.
