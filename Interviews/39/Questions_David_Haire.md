## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: CME NL Member Manufacturing Pain Points 🏭

**"You work with 1000+ manufacturers across Newfoundland & Labrador. From your perspective as VP, what are the top 3-5 operational challenges that your members struggle with most? And specifically, within those challenges, where do you see supply chain, parts sourcing, or inventory management showing up?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates pain points at scale**: Do many manufacturers struggle with sourcing?
- **Quantifies the problem**: How widespread is the spare parts / long lead time issue?
- **Identifies which industries hurt most**: Offshore suppliers, shipbuilders, manufacturers?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Supply chain pain**: "Our members constantly complain about long lead times and obsolete parts"
- ✅ **Inventory burden**: "Manufacturers are sitting on huge inventories to avoid stockouts"
- ✅ **Geographic isolation**: "Being in NL means 2-3 week lead times from mainland suppliers"
- ✅ **Labor-supply interaction**: "Parts shortages + labor shortages = production delays"
- ✅ **Cost impact**: "Sourcing and inventory management probably cost them $50K-$200K per year"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Supply chain isn't a major pain point for my members" (no market)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which of your members have the worst supply chain challenges? Offshore suppliers? Shipbuilders?"
- "Have you heard members ask about alternative sourcing methods or technologies?"
- "What percentage of your members would you say are actively concerned about supply chain efficiency?"
- "Are there seasonal sourcing challenges (e.g., winter shipping delays)?"
- "Do your members ever ask CME for supply chain solutions or vendor connections?"

### Q2: Additive Manufacturing Awareness & Readiness 🔍

**which members of CME NL do you think would be most ready to adopt AM for parts sourcing, manufacturing, or inventory? What would a 'good fit' member look like?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Tests AM awareness**: Is AM on the radar for manufacturers?
- **Identifies early adopters**: Which members are innovation-ready?
- **Validates beachhead strategy**: Who are our first customers among CME members?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Low current awareness**: "Many members haven't heard of AM or see it as experimental"
- ✅ **Growth in tech-forward members**: "Some of our younger, tech-savvy companies are exploring it"
- ✅ **Early adopter profile**: "Mid-size manufacturers (20-100 employees), aerospace/medical suppliers, companies with R&D"
- ✅ **Barriers identified**: "Cost, material limitations, certification requirements are holding back adoption"
- ✅ **Education need**: "Members would need to see real case studies and ROI before investing"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "My members see AM as too experimental or expensive"

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Are there any CME members already using or exploring AM?"
- "Which industries within your membership (aerospace, marine, medical) would be most likely to try AM?"
- "Would company size matter? (i.e., do larger members adopt tech faster?)"
- "What would help your members get comfortable with AM? Case studies? Webinars? Pilot programs?"
- "How many of your members would you estimate have <$500K annual parts/sourcing costs vs. $500K-$2M vs. >$2M?"

### Q3: Supply Chain Ecosystem & Competitive Landscape 📊

**"Within the CME NL ecosystem, who do your members currently rely on for parts sourcing? Local distributors, OEMs, online marketplaces, logistics partners? And what are their biggest frustrations with the current system? Is there a gap in the market?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Identifies current competitors**: Who are we competing against?
- **Tests differentiation**: What makes a platform solution better than current options?
- **Validates market gap**: Is there a real opportunity, or is the problem already solved?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Fragmented supply**: "Members use 5-10 different suppliers and there's no coordination"
- ✅ **Long lead times**: "Standard suppliers take 4-8 weeks; emergency suppliers cost 2-3x"
- ✅ **OEM lock-in**: "OEMs have monopoly pricing and won't negotiate on lead times"
- ✅ **Inventory waste**: "Members keep excess stock and still miss parts; it's expensive and inefficient"
- ✅ **Geographic disadvantage**: "Being in NL means we pay more for shipping and wait longer"
- ✅ **Quality/certification concerns**: "Members struggle to prove parts meet specs/certifications"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "The current system works fine; no real gap in the market"

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Do any local CME members offer parts sourcing or logistics services?"
- "Are there regional distributors vs. national/global ones? Who do members prefer?"
- "What's the typical markup on emergency/expedited parts vs. standard delivery?"
- "Have members asked you for better sourcing solutions or part supplier connections?"
- "Do certification requirements (ISO, sector-specific) add cost or complexity to sourcing?"
- "Would members value a single platform to manage multiple supplier relationships?"

- ✅ **Validation role**: "CME could pilot this with 5-10 members and get feedback"
- ✅ **Distribution potential**: "We could promote this through our webinars, newsletters, events"
- ✅ **Co-branding interest**: "A CME-endorsed solution would give you credibility"
- ✅ **Revenue model fit**: "A revenue-share or member discount model would work for us"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "CME's role is advocacy, not product distribution" (limited partnership)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What would CME need to see before endorsing a solution? (Proof of concept? Customer testimonials?)"
- "Would a pilot program with 5-10 CME members be possible?"
- "How often does CME host member webinars or educational events? Could we present?"
- "Would CME be willing to introduce us to a few willing pilot members?"
