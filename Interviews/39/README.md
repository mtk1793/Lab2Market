## What We're Testing

### Primary Hypothesis
**"CME NL members face significant supply chain challenges (long lead times, inventory burden, parts sourcing) that a supply chain platform could solve. CME NL could be a distribution/validation partner, and government programs could support scaling."**

### Key Questions
1. **Do manufacturers actually struggle with supply chain?** (Validate problem at scale)
2. **How aware are they of AM?** (Test market readiness)
3. **Who are the early adopters?** (Identify pilot partners)
4. **Would CME endorse/distribute?** (Test partnership model)
5. **Who else should we know?** (Ecosystem mapping)

## Success Looks Like...

✅ **Best case:** David validates pain, identifies 3-5 pilot members, offers CME endorsement, connects us to government + ecosystem partners
😐 **Good case:** David acknowledges pain, provides some ecosystem intel, stays open to future partnership
❌ **Poor case:** David sees no pain, no partnership interest, limited ecosystem access
