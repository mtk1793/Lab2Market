## Interview Recording Notes

### Opening & Introduction (00:20 - 02:10)

**Mahmoud:** Thanks for being here on the public holiday, I really appreciate it.

**David:** Actually, we don't have that holiday here. We have Snowflakes Day and Hornsman's Day instead.

**Mahmoud:** Ah, okay, good to know! Thanks for clarifying.

**Mahmoud:** [Introduces self] My name is Mahmoud Kiasari. I'm doing my PhD at Dalhousie University. About 2 years ago, I was working with a company in 3D printing and additive manufacturing. That idea developed and recently was accepted into the Lab2Market program at Dalhousie. As part of the program, I need to talk with at least 100 people to validate that my work is acceptable for the market. I'm reaching out to experts like you to get your perspective.

**David:** [Introduces self] I'm David Haire, an industrial engineering technologist with a strong background in Lean and quality systems. I work with Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters (CME), which is a 154-year-old industry association made up of manufacturers and exporters. We're one of the largest in the country. Our members join for 3 main reasons: advocacy, programs/training, and networking.

**Mahmoud:** Networking is what I'm looking for right now, so this is fantastic.

## Question 1: Top Operational Challenges for CME Members (04:05 - 05:33)

**Mahmoud:** You work with lots of manufacturers across Newfoundland & Labrador. From your perspective as VP, what are the top 3-5 operational challenges that your members struggle with most?

**David:**
- **#1: Ability to expand and upskill staff** - About 50% is general labor (attract/retain), then tradesmen, engineering/technology, management/supervision
- **#2: Assess and adopt technology at a quicker rate** - This is especially problematic in Atlantic Canada
- **#3: Systematic approach to launching new products/services** - Usually not systematic, no structure
- **#4: Ability to export and add value** - Hard to go international if you're not strong domestically
- **#5: Green/sustainability/net-zero** - Waning but still important, especially for European market access

## Question 2: AM Adoption Readiness (05:55 - 06:59)

**Mahmoud:** Which CME NL members do you think would be most ready to adopt AM for parts sourcing, manufacturing, or inventory?

**David:**
There are 2 companies that exist to do additive manufacturing:
1. **PolyUnity** - Produces parts for healthcare, nuclear, and Canada-wide
2. **Atlantic XL** - Does metal printing (startup)

Most of our members use AM to serve themselves - clips, unique parts, prototyping. The bulk of our members using AM are serving themselves internally, not as external part providers. Exception: 2-3 companies.

**Mahmoud:** I've talked to Atlantic XL and people keep referring me to PolyUnity. Hopefully I can connect with them too.

## Question 3: Part Sourcing & Local Ecosystem (07:12 - 08:03)

**Mahmoud:** Within the CME ecosystem, who do your members currently rely on for part sourcing? You mentioned they're trying to do it in-house. Are there local distributors, OEMs, or logistics partners they work with?

**David:**
A lot of places still use machine shops. For specialty parts:
- **FabTech/Silver Dolphin Boats** - Prints parts for themselves
- **Electronics company** - Uses it for lighting, electronic systems, control panels; prints for themselves
- **Pattern**: Small quantities, small batch, printing for internal use rather than buying external

## Question 4: Certification & Registration Barriers (08:07 - 10:03)

**Mahmoud:** I heard that offshore companies struggle with registration and certification (Lloyd's Register, DNV). How do your members handle these issues?

**David:**
- Haven't heard certification issues mentioned much among general CME members
- **Healthcare (PolyUnity)**: Need to validate antibacterial properties, specifications
- **Metal powder printing**: Biggest concern is reliability and repeatability
  - Traditional steel: 100+ years of proven specs
  - 3D printed metal: Concerns about material specs from additive vs. removal process
  - Will it last? Do specs meet proven requirements?

**Context provided:**
- CME Canada Makes (now part of NCAN - Network of Advanced Manufacturing Centers)
- CME given funding to raise awareness/understanding of AM (~8-10 years ago)
- David just stepped down from Canada Makes advisory board
- CME's Advanced Manufacturing Cluster Atlantic is one of 11 pillars
- Exposed Atlantic Canadians to RAPID conference (2024, 2025) and IMTS
- Working on proposals for technology exposure

## Question 5: Partnership & Pilot Program Potential (11:11 - 12:17)

**Mahmoud:** Imagine we have a technology that could solve supply management struggles. Could CME host a pilot program, provide access to member companies, or help market it?

**David:** **Absolutely.**
- CME pilots things sometimes
- First took Atlantic Canadians to Hanover Messe (world's largest manufacturing tech show) as a pilot
- Repeated in 2023, 2025
- Started as pilot, continuing
- Exposing members to world's latest technologies, including AM

## Project Presentation (12:17 - 14:03)

**Mahmoud:** [Presents the idea]

The idea is to build an **ecosystem between different entities**:
- Build a platform connecting users: manufacturers, OEMs, 3D printing facilities, authorities/registration bodies
- **Goal**: Reduce downtime costs, especially for limited/offshore places (oil & gas)
- **Approach**:
  - Encourage on-site 3D printing (not providing machines, but connections)
  - Connect customers to closest 3D printing facilities via platform
  - Reduce downtime costs
- **Additional components**:
  - Digital inventory (shift from physical to digital)
  - AI/machine learning for digital imagery, platform optimization, predictive maintenance
- **Challenge**: Trying to gather knowledge to see what direction to narrow down

**Asks David:** As an expert with experience, how would you assess this idea? Should I change direction? Should I keep the current focus?

## David's Expert Feedback (14:08 - 16:43)

**David's Response:**

**On the ecosystem/network:**
- Canada Makes is a network connector with a code showing:
  - Who has what machinery/capability/materials
  - But only reaches ~15% of Canadian market
  - **Gap opportunity**: Another 85% might need your solution

**On digital inventory:**
- Challenge: Intellectual property concerns
  - Many companies: "I own the specifications and drawings, I don't want anybody to share"
  - Contrast: Thingiverse/Prusa - public library of downloadable files (free designs)
  - **Key insight**: "When money starts changing hands, it's a different world"

**On business case (most critical insight):**
- **Challenge with business model**: Especially for metal AM
- Metal machinery is **expensive** - hard to make money back
- Manufacturing equation:
  - Cost of machinery + powder + cleanup + changeovers
  - Often cheaper to just buy parts from someone else

**Example given**: Titanium knees/hearts for humans
- Would need massive volume to pay back equipment investment
- Special materials (titanium) require expensive machinery

**David's concern**: "When it's so expensive to buy the machinery, how do I get my money back?"

**Bottom line**: "When you get into metal stuff, you're almost cheaper just to say 'here's somebody make me this part, I'll buy it off you.'"

## Ecosystem & Connections (16:50 - 18:20)

**Mahmoud:** You mentioned Canada Makes. I talked with someone (Mr. Defalco?) who connected me to another person in my field.

**David:**
- Defalco worked for CME Canada Makes, then went to NCAN (ENGINE)
- He's on the board of Canada Makes
- **Upcoming event**: CME's Advanced Manufacturing Cluster Atlantic meeting with ENGINE N3 Summit
  - March 30-31 and April 1
  - All 30 clusters gathering (executive directors)
  - **Location**: Toronto
  - **Purpose**: Gather cluster leaders once per year

**Mahmoud:** Is this a private meeting or public conference?

**David:** Don't know if it's public, but it's the ENGINE N3 Summit in Toronto.

## Follow-Up & Relationship Building (18:20 - 19:10)

**Mahmoud:** One last favor - could we have another 15-20 minute call in the future once I've gathered more knowledge? I'd like to update you on progress.

**David:** **Absolutely.** No problem at all.

## Closing Insights on AI & Advanced Manufacturing (19:10 - 20:41)

**David's closing thoughts:**

**On AM's future:**
"Additive manufacturing is going to move beyond prototyping and testing. It's going to become an integral part in the future."

**On AI & Manufacturing:**
- CME just ran first "AI for Manufacturing" program
- Closing out year with ~350 people; targeting 400 in next 1-2 months
- Can get very specific: AI in advanced manufacturing, AI in additive, machine learning AI
- **Key point**: "If you can ask the question, if you can think it, it can probably do it—if it has the knowledge and background"
- **AI will play tremendous role in advanced manufacturing**

**On barriers & awareness:**
- CME/ENGINE did research paper: "Barriers and Constraints of NL Companies Adopting Advanced Manufacturing"
- Finding: **Awareness, understanding, and knowledge of advanced manufacturing is still lacking**
  - Terms like "Industry 4.0," "smart manufacturing," "advanced manufacturing" - many don't understand
- **11 pillars of advanced manufacturing**:
  - Robotics, Big Data, Digital Twin, Cybersecurity, Additive, and others
  - **Connectivity among them**: People see them as separate, but they're interconnected

## Final Connections Mentioned (20:52 - 21:19)

**Mahmoud:** One of my goals is to reach out to Kraken Robotics, but they seem busy. Are they working on additive?

**David:**
- **Subsea Controls/Kraken Robotics** - Print lots of parts for themselves
- Make underwater camera systems
- Based in Clarenville, Newfoundland
- Have lots of printers
- Print for themselves (internal use)

**Mahmoud:** Okay, I'll reach out to them.
