## EMAIL

**To:** David Haire
**Subject:** Thank You — CME NL Conversation + Exciting Development to Share

---

Hi David,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me on February 16th. Our conversation has been one of the most strategically valuable in my customer discovery process so far, and I've been thinking about your insights ever since.

A few things I wanted to share and follow up on:

**1. Your feedback directly shaped our strategy.**
Your point about the 85% gap — that Canada Makes/ENGINE only reaches roughly 15% of Canadian manufacturers — crystallized something for me. We've since reframed AddManuChain away from being purely an "AM marketplace" and toward being an **Advanced Manufacturing Ecosystem & Intelligence Platform**. Your challenge about the metal AM ROI ("how do I get my money back?") confirmed that we should be the matchmaker and the intelligence layer — not the equipment seller. That's exactly where we're heading.

**2. A major validation since our conversation — Lloyd's Register.**
On February 18th, I had a group meeting with three representatives from Lloyd's Register (Trevor Butler in St. John's, Adam Saxty in the UK, and Dave Whitehouse in Dartmouth). They confirmed that Atlantic XL in St. John's just received **the first AM facility qualification certificate in the entire Americas** — a major milestone that directly affects our certification strategy. The pre-certified parts library model we discussed is now validated at the highest level.

**3. The N3 Summit — I'd love your advice.**
You mentioned that David Haire of CME NL has taken Atlantic Canadians to events like RAPID and Hannover Messe in the past, and that ENGINE's N3 Summit (Toronto, March 30–April 1) brings together all 30 Canadian AM cluster leaders. I'm weighing attending — is this something you'd recommend as a priority for where we are in building the platform? Would you potentially be attending, or know who from CME NL will be there?

**4. The PolyUnity Introduction.**
You mentioned PolyUnity as one of the few companies in Atlantic Canada doing external commercial AM work — particularly in healthcare and with certification experience. I'd be very grateful for that warm introduction when the timing is right for you. Understanding how they handle the certification and business model challenges would be invaluable.

**5. The CME NL Partnership.**
You expressed genuine interest in exploring AddManuChain as a tool that CME NL could pilot with members. I'm ready to start that conversation whenever it makes sense for you. Even a small pilot with 5–10 engaged CME members — particularly those already using AM internally — could generate the case studies we need to demonstrate real value.

Would you be open to a 30-minute follow-up call in the next two weeks? I'd love to share where the platform concept has evolved and get your continued feedback. You've offered to connect again, and I'd like to take you up on that.

Thank you again, David. Your candour about the challenges (especially the metal AM ROI concern) made me a better entrepreneur. That's the most valuable thing anyone in this process can give.

Looking forward to staying connected.

Warm regards,
