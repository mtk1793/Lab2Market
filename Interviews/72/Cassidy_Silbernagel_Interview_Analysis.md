# Interview 72 Analysis: Cassidy Silbernagel - AM Adoption Barriers & Digital Thread Fragmentation

**Date of Interview:** March 2026  
**Interviewee:** Cassidy Silbernagel (Head of AM Engineering, Exergy Solutions)  
**Interview Type:** Expert Practitioner Deep-Dive  
**Strategic Importance:** 🔥 CRITICAL — Reveals core AM adoption ecosystem gaps and validates AddManuChain's platform thesis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Cassidy provided one of the most technically sophisticated interviews to date. Key revelation: **The supply chain fragmentation problem is not just a nuisance—it's the structural barrier preventing AM adoption at scale in Canada.** While Cassidy cited education, certification, and cost as challenges, the recurring theme across all five main questions was **loss of traceability and broken digital threads** due to fragmented processes, tool incompatibilities, and lack of unified supply chain integration.

**Critical for AddManuChain:** Cassidy explicitly validated the platform thesis in the final exchange—acknowledging the need for ecosystem-level solutions that connect end-users, OEMs, service bureaus, and regulatory bodies, but warning that **narrow target markets won't achieve traction** and that **clear value proposition to clients is non-negotiable.**

## KEY INTERVIEW INSIGHTS

### THEME 1: AM Adoption Requires a Ramp-Up Curve (Not a Binary Switch)

**Cassidy's Framework:**
1. **Phase 1 - Comfort Building:** Start with single small "swap-in/swap-out" component to reduce client risk
2. **Phase 2 - Value Discovery:** Once client sees tangible benefit (cost, lead time, performance), willingness to explore increases
3. **Phase 3 - Full DfAM Exploration:** After trust established, clients give "blank sheet" and let engineers optimize designs
4. **Phase 4 - Mastery:** Full design freedom, topology optimization, multi-part consolidation

**Key Quote:** *"There's some education that goes around teaching them why they want to use additive in the first place in order for them to see the value in it."*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Client education and onboarding are critical—customers need guided discovery, not just catalog browsing
- Platform should include use-case mapping and business case validation ("Why additive for THIS part?")
- Success requires demonstrated ROI early (cost per part, lead time reduction, performance gains)

---

### THEME 2: Regulations & Certification Are Major Blockers (But Not The Biggest)

**Direct Quote:** *"Regulations are definitely a challenge. Being able to certify a part either as pressure vessel or to some API standard or some other standard. That is typically one of the big ones that we see."*

**Deeper Context:**
- Pressure vessel certification, API standards, aerospace/defense compliance are client showstoppers
- Each standard requires different process documentation, material qualification, traceability evidence
- Certification path is not standardized—varies by client, industry, regulatory body

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Platform should include **certification pathway templates** for common industries (aerospace, defense, medical, O&G)
- **Regulatory compliance documentation** feature could differentiate AddManuChain
- Need partnerships with certification bodies or regulatory affairs consultants
- This is a **high-value problem**—clients will pay premium for streamlined certification support

### THEME 3: Digital Thread is Broken Everywhere (Critical Business Opportunity)

**Cassidy's Specific Finding:**
*"It's broken everywhere, because there is no one single unified process. You're constantly losing the traceability along the way."*

**Where the Thread Breaks:**
1. **Design → Process Parameters:** File translation loses metadata (CAD → STEP → machine code)
2. **Process Parameters → Machine Execution:** Different software for different machines; no unified logging
3. **Machine Execution → Post-Processing:** Current machine data not linked to post-processing (HIP, heat treat, machining)
4. **Post-Processing → Inspection/QA:** Completely siloed; inspection data not traced back to print parameters
5. **Everywhere for Powder Management:** Recycled powder traceability is a nightmare (whose powder in the bed? How many cycles?)

**Critical Quote:** *"Defense, aerospace, medical definitely need that traceability for every single aspect. But there's also other aspects that break down completely even if you did have a unified solution. Because when you're dealing with powder, how do you keep traceability of what's in your powder bed, unless you're using virgin powder every single time?"*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **Highest-value AddManuChain feature:** Unified digital thread from design → machine → post-processing → delivery
- Especially critical for **regulated industries** (aerospace, defense, medical, O&G)
- Powder traceability is solvable through **barcode/QR system on powder batches** paired with machine-side tracking
- This addresses a **real pain point** that creates compliance risk for clients—customers will pay for this

### THEME 4: Commodity Parts Should NOT Be 3D Printed (But Discernment is Missing)

**Cassidy's Perspective:**
*"Once they get the new hammer, everything starts looking like a nail. A lot of people think, 'We could 3D print this and this and this.' But no, that doesn't make sense because this is a commodity item that's super cheap, and it's not going to be cheap via printing."*

**The Problem Cassidy Described:**
- Clients overapply AM to parts where it adds no value
- Engineers ask "What problem does printing solve?" and get silence
- This leads to failed projects, wasted budget, and loss of confidence in AM

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Platform should include **part evaluation logic** to screen out commodity items
- **Use-case matching algorithm** that identifies when AM is appropriate vs. when conventional manufacturing is better
- Help clients avoid expensive mistakes through intelligent guidance

---

### THEME 5: AI/ML Today is Mostly Hype; Limited Practical Applications in AM

**Cassidy's Honest Assessment:**
*"I haven't really seen a lot in the AM space... People have been talking about process parameter optimization on the fly. But again, depending on your client that may or may not work because of the standards that they're working to—they need to have a constant process, not one that varies."*

**Where AI Actually Helps:**
1. **Print Orientation & Support Structure Optimization** — Real value, speeds up prep work
2. **Creating New Process Parameters from Scratch** — AI can explore parameter space faster than manual trials
3. **CAD/Reporting Workflow Automation** — Already useful today
4. **Computational Design Tools** (Code-based design, not traditional CAD) — Where AI will shine

**Where AI Doesn't Help Yet:**
- Direct design optimization (traditional CAD + AI not mature)
- On-the-fly process adjustment for regulated parts (clients need reproducible, fixed processes)
- Defect detection/in-process monitoring (still early)

**Cassidy's Current Project:**
*"We're printing next-generation parts for clients that hasn't where that design in industry hasn't been touched for the last 50 years. We're doing it without CAD, it's all computationally programmed based."*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Don't oversell AI as magic bullet for AM
- Focus on **pragmatic, proven AI applications:** orientation optimization, parametric design, workflow automation
- Opportunity in **computational design tooling** for clients wanting to break from traditional CAD
- Be cautious with claims about AI-driven process adjustment for regulated clients

### THEME 6: Supply Chain Hubs Model Exists; Procurement is the Real Bottleneck

**Cassidy's Geographic Assessment:**
- **Winnipeg Hub:** Precision ADM (medical, aerospace)
- **Ontario Hub:** Furlough (automotive, aerospace)
- **Maritime Hub:** Several companies (marine focus)
- **Calgary/Western Canada:** Limited but growing (Exergy, others)

**The Real Constraint:** *"It's really just getting that first machine that takes the most efforts. Scaling up after that is fairly easy."*

**Additional Insight - Raw Materials:** *"The biggest step to getting a second machine is just getting the facilities and the ancillary equipment to support that first machine. And then once you have a second machine, you basically just need to make sure you have additional footprint. So yeah, the raw materials and specifically the powders become the bottleneck."*

**The Procurement Problem:**
- Companies must navigate 20-30 different metal printing vendors to validate capabilities
- Powder sourcing is fragmented and tied to specific machines/manufacturers
- Service bureaus can't expand easily because clients take successful projects in-house once volumes increase
- No transparent marketplace showing "who can do what" and "at what cost"

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **Supply chain transparency marketplace** is critical value—clients spending months vetting vendors
- Focus on **powder sourcing standardization** as a competitive moat
- Recognize that service bureaus are in a tough spot; position AddManuChain to help them pivot from volume chasing to specialized services
- O&G opportunity: Custom powder sourcing for marine/deepwater applications

### THEME 7: Canadian Market is Education-Constrained, Not Machine-Constrained

**Cassidy's Key Finding:**
*"Education. No matter how advanced the industry is in terms of the printing technology. If people don't know what it is or how to use it, it's never going to gain adoption. Just before the pandemic, I was actually interviewing for GE Additive in Germany, and I asked them what's the biggest challenge that you face? And they're like, 'Oh, it's just teaching people what it is.' And I'm like, why would I go there, gain all this experience, come back to Canada and help teach, when really it's the same problems that they're facing that we're facing here."*

**Secondary Finding - Skill Shortage:**
*"There's definitely a skill shortage there in terms of qualified people who can run these machines. But the amount of machines that are out there these days is there's more than we need. So we need more use cases to fill the machines."*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Invest in **customer education content** (webinars, case studies, use-case libraries)
- Build **skill-building partnerships** with universities, vocational programs
- Position AddManuChain as **knowledge gateway** for customers discovering AM for the first time
- Recognize that over-supplied machine market means opportunity for **software/intelligence layers** to increase utilization

### THEME 8: Platform Concept Validated but Must Solve a Clear Problem

**User Pitch (AddManuChain concept):**
- Connect end-users, OEMs, 3D printing facilities, and regulatory bodies
- Enable on-site printing OR remote facility access
- Standardize digital inventory (reduce physical inventory risk)
- Use AI across the ecosystem (ordering prediction, supply chain optimization, etc.)

**Cassidy's Response:**
*"It's a challenge because until you have a broader client base, it's harder to build these types of solutions specifically for Canada. Because I don't think the user base is quite large enough for a solution like that. So I think that becomes a challenge. I think you really have to nail down. What is the exact problem that you're solving for the client that they can't solve in any other way?"*

**Final Advice:**
*"Yeah, I think it's really just I really got to narrow in on that target market, make sure it's as broad as possible. I've seen where the target market is such a small segment that it becomes so niche that it's hard to get any traction."*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Platform thesis is valid, but **crystal-clear value prop is essential**
- Must start with a **specific, solvable problem** for a target segment (not try to solve everything)
- Cassidy's advice aligns with lean startup methodology—focus and iterate
- Potential entry angles:
  - **O&G:** Digital inventory + supply chain visibility for 24/7-critical parts
  - **Aerospace:** Certification pathway + digital thread for compliance
  - **Marine/Subsea:** Corrosion-resistant powder sourcing + project tracking

## STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### For AddManuChain Product Development

1. **Highest Priority: Digital Thread & Traceability**
   - Unified design-to-delivery tracking system
   - Powder batch tracking + machine state logging
   - Post-processing integration
   - Compliance evidence generation for regulatory submissions
   - **Why:** Cassidy explicitly flagged this as universally broken; clients need this for regulated work

2. **High Priority: Part Evaluation & Use-Case Matching**
   - Intelligent part screening (AM vs. conventional)
   - ROI calculator for AM vs. traditional manufacturing
   - Business case validation before supplier search
   - **Why:** Prevents wasted projects and builds client confidence

3. **High Priority: Supplier Transparency & Procurement**
   - Capability mapping (who can do what, at what spec level)
   - Certification pathway templates (pressure vessels, aerospace, medical)
   - Powder sourcing standardization and availability
   - **Why:** Companies spending months vetting vendors; this is a massive time/cost killer

4. **Medium Priority: Certification Support**
   - Regulatory pathway guidance
   - Documentation templates for common standards
   - Partner network of certification consultants
   - **Why:** Real blocker for regulated industries; adds significant value

5. **Lower Priority: AI/ML Features** (until core platform is mature)
   - Start with print orientation optimization (proven value)
   - Build computational design tooling gradually
   - Avoid overpromising on predictive features
   - **Why:** Cassidy's honest assessment—most AI in AM is still hype

### Target Markets to Prioritize

**Tier 1 (Highest Potential):**
- **Aerospace/Defense:** Certification requirements + regular high-complexity parts
- **Marine/Subsea (O&G):** 24/7-critical parts + custom powder requirements + corrosion concerns
- **Medical Devices:** Regulatory intensity + high traceability requirements

**Tier 2 (Strong Secondary):**
- **Automotive Suppliers:** High-volume, cost-sensitive, DfAM-heavy
- **Industrial Equipment (Pumps, Motors, etc.):** Performance optimization, weight reduction

**Avoid Initially:**
- **Commodity Parts Manufacturers:** Low margins, low AM value proposition
- **Toy/Consumer Electronics:** Low regulatory requirements, very price-sensitive

### Go-to-Market Strategy

1. **Start with a specific, solvable problem** (Cassidy's advice)
   - Example: "For aerospace suppliers with 500+ custom AM parts/year, we reduce supply chain coordination time by 60% and ensure regulatory compliance through unified digital traceability"
   - NOT "We connect everyone to everything for all AM projects"

2. **Build a knowledge/education layer into the platform**
   - Educational content (use-case library, best practices, industry case studies)
   - Webinars and customer success support
   - Partner with academia for skill-building initiatives

3. **Prioritize Canadian O&G/Marine** as first market
   - Cassidy mentioned custom corrosion-resistant materials
   - 24/7-critical parts require supply chain reliability
   - Procurement bottleneck is acute in this space
   - "Canadian made" positioning aligns with procurement preferences

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

**Against What Cassidy Said Exists:**
- **Precision ADM (Winnipeg):** Service bureau model; will lose clients to in-house once volume grows
- **Furlough (Ontario):** Service bureau; same constraint
- **Field Zones (EU):** Platform concept similar to AddManuChain; proving the model works in Europe

**Where AddManuChain Can Differentiate:**
1. **Unified digital thread** + traceability (none of the existing players offer this systematically)
2. **Certification pathway support** (removes major blocker for regulated industries)
3. **Intelligent part screening** (prevents failed projects, builds confidence)
4. **Powder sourcing optimization** (Cassidy identified this as key bottleneck)

---

## RED FLAGS & RISKS IDENTIFIED

1. **Market Size Concern:** Cassidy warned that Canadian AM user base may be too small to support complex platform
   - *Mitigation:* Start with focused vertical (O&G/aerospace) where market is larger; expand horizontally once established

2. **Service Bureau Disruption:** As companies move from outsourced → in-house printing
   - *Mitigation:* Position AddManuChain to help service bureaus become specialized engineering partners, not just suppliers

3. **Regulatory Fragmentation:** No single regulatory pathway for AM; varies by industry and client
   - *Mitigation:* Build modular certification templates; partner with regulatory consultants

4. **Powder Supply Constraints:** Raw material sourcing is fragmented and machine-specific
   - *Mitigation:* Partner with material suppliers; create standardization initiative
