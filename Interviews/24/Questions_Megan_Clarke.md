## ❓ Strategic Interview Questions (5 Questions)

### Q1: Downtime Cost Quantification 💰
**"Based on your procurement experience, what is the average cost of downtime for a vessel waiting on a safety-certified part to arrive from overseas?"**

**Why this question:**
- Gets specific **numbers** (cost per day/hour)
- Quantifies the business case for local AM production
- Reveals urgency level for solution

**Expected insights:**
- Daily downtime costs ($50K-$500K range based on vessel type)
- Frequency of these delays (per year)
- Parts that cause most critical delays

**Follow-up probes:**
- How often does this happen per year?
- Which specific parts cause the most critical delays?
- What percentage of delays are due to certification paperwork vs physical part availability?

### Q2: Safety Audit Manual Effort 📋
**"In your role at Metalcare, how much manual effort went into correlating inspection reports with specific part serial numbers for safety audits?"**

**Why this question:**
- Focuses on her **specific background** (Metalcare inspection experience)
- Uncovers hidden time costs in certification tracking
- Gets **numbers** (hours per audit, staff time)

**Expected insights:**
- Time per audit (hours/days)
- Staff resources required
- Error rates in manual tracking systems

**Follow-up probes:**
- What was the biggest bottleneck in this process?
- How many parts typically needed tracking per inspection?
- What happened when documentation was missing or incomplete?

### Q3: Pre-Certified Safety Passport Concept 🔐
**"How would a pre-certified 'Safety Passport' for digital parts change how Horizon Maritime manages its offshore logistics?"**

**Why this question:**
- Tests our **core value proposition** (H60: Pre-Certified Parts Library)
- Gets reaction to digital certification concept
- Reveals procurement workflow pain points

**Expected insights:**
- Current certification verification process
- Barriers to adopting non-traditional parts
- Requirements for digital certification system

**Follow-up probes:**
- What information would need to be in this "Safety Passport"?
- Who would need to approve this at Horizon Maritime?
- What Class Societies (DNV, ABS, Lloyd's) does Horizon work with?

---

### Q4: Certification Lead Time ROI 💰
**"If we could reduce the certification lead time by 50% using a digital inventory, what would that look like in terms of annual operational savings?"**

**Why this question:**
- Gets specific **ROI numbers** (annual savings)
- Tests our value proposition (NH.9: Digital Inventory Reduces Lead Time)
- Forces calculation of business case

**Expected insights:**
- Annual procurement/certification costs
- Number of parts requiring certification per year
- Current lead time for certification (weeks/months)

**Follow-up probes:**
- How many parts require certification approval per year?
- What's the current average lead time for certification?
- What percentage of your procurement budget goes to expedited shipping for certified parts?

### Q5: Top 3 Regulatory Hurdles 🚧
**"What are the top 3 regulatory hurdles you face when trying to introduce non-traditional (3D printed or local) parts into a marine safety management system?"**

**Why this question:**
- Identifies **barriers** we need to solve (NH.7: Certification is Primary Gatekeeper)
- Gets prioritized list of challenges
- Reveals decision-making process for new technologies

**Expected insights:**
- Class Society approval process
- OEM certification requirements
- Internal safety management system constraints

**Follow-up probes:**
- Have you ever tried to get a 3D printed part approved? What happened?
- What would make you comfortable using an AM part for a non-critical application?
- Who at Horizon Maritime makes the final decision on part approval?
