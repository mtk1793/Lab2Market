# Interview 75: David Bursey - Cenovus Corrosion Engineer

**Status:** ✅ Interview Completed & Analyzed  
**Date:** March 18, 2026  
**Duration:** ~20 minutes  
**Interviewee:** David Bursey (Senior Corrosion Engineer, Pressure Systems Integrity Program, Cenovus Energy)

---

## Overview

David Bursey is the Senior Corrosion Engineer managing the Pressure Systems Integrity Program at Cenovus Energy's Atlantic Region deepwater operations. With 20+ years in oil & gas industry and M.Eng. in Corrosion Engineering, David speaks from **20 years of managing real pressure system failures** in one of the world's harshest operating environments.

**This interview provided the most operationally grounded validation of AddManuChain's core hypothesis: emergency supply chain delays create a viable window for on-site manufacturing.**

## Key Takeaways

### Problem 1: Supply Chain Delays Create Weekly Emergencies
- **Finding:** Material lead times extended from weeks to months post-COVID (duplex stainless, titanium)
- **Real Example (This Morning):** Simple bolts took 1.5 weeks to deliver
- **Impact:** Operators forced into risky material substitution with increased inspection burden
- **Opportunity:** 7-10 day delay window creates margin for on-site printing (1-3 day cycle)

### Problem 2: Small Parts Are High-Criticality Inventory Bottlenecks
- **Finding:** Commodity parts (bolts, seals, valve seats, adapters) create mission-critical failures
- **Example:** Valve components with long lead times force temporary repairs and extended shutdowns
- **Impact:** Offshore downtime costs ~$100K+/day; small parts have outsized leverage
- **Opportunity:** Start with commodity parts library; highest value, lowest complexity

### Problem 3: Automatic Inventory Management is Explicitly Desired
- **David's Vision:** *"If we could print components offshore... when inventory drops, the printer kicks in and produces more... that would be fantastic."*
- **Impact:** Reduces planned maintenance cycle time by weeks
- **Opportunity:** Feature: Automatic threshold-triggered printing integrated with Asset Integrity Management Systems (AIMS)

### Problem 4: Proprietary Parts Lock-in is the Real Blocker
- **Finding:** 80% of parts are proprietary to vendors (valve internals, specialized components)
- **Impact:** Vendors resist digital inventory; use IP as lock-in mechanism
- **Opportunity:** Start with generic 20% of parts; work with customers to gradually unlock proprietary designs

### Problem 5: Regulatory Certification is Achievable (But Time-Consuming)
- **Finding:** DNV/Lloyd's pathways exist; vendors can certify new materials/processes
- **Impact:** Takes time and cost, but not a technical barrier
- **Opportunity:** Pre-certify AM processes with verification societies; reduce approval time for customers

### Problem 6: Risk-Based Qualitative Maintenance is Entrenched
- **Finding:** David's approach: consensus-driven qualitative risk assessment (API 580), not numerical prediction
- **Impact:** Strong preference for conservative, collaborative methodology over pure data optimization
- **Opportunity:** Enhance, don't replace; AI tools should improve on current practice while respecting conservatism

### Problem 7: Failure Modes are Predictable and Addressable
- **Finding:** Three primary failure modes: corrosion-induced coating degradation, pressure vessel repairs, mechanical clamps/temporary repairs
- **Impact:** Failures follow patterns; solutions exist (just take time/money)
- **Opportunity:** Digital library of repair solutions + rapid sourcing reduces response time

### Problem 8: Emergency Sourcing is Normal Operations with Brutal Economics
- **Finding:** Emergency ordering is built into budgets; vendors charge premiums for expedited delivery
- **Impact:** Company routinely spends on emergency air freight, temporary repairs, increased inspection
- **Opportunity:** On-site printing becomes standard operating procedure, not exception

## Insights for Product Direction

### Highest Priority
**1. Small Parts Commodity Library**
- Bolts, fasteners, seals, valve seats, adapters
- Start with 10-20 highest-volume SKUs
- Pre-engineered specifications per industry standard (ASME, API)
- Material options: duplex stainless, titanium, standard alloys

**2. Automatic Inventory Management Integration**
- Threshold-based triggering (when stock hits X%, print automatically)
- Integration with AIMS (Asset Integrity Management Systems)
- Consumption-based prediction
- Regulatory compliance documentation generation

**3. Regulatory Certification Pathways**
- Partnership with DNV/Lloyd's for pre-certified AM processes
- Material equivalency documentation
- Process specification records
- Traceability evidence generation

### High Priority
**4. Emergency Sourcing ROI Calculator**
- Compare: traditional vendor order vs. on-site printing vs. emergency air freight
- Show downtime cost savings
- Justify capex investment for printing capability

**5. Vendor Integration & Approval Tracking**
- Track which vendors approve printed parts for their systems
- Certification status per component
- Approved material specs per subsystem

### Medium Priority
**6. Supply Chain Visibility & Intelligence**
- Vendor lead time tracking
- Material availability alerts
- Emergency alert system (when stock criticals)

## Key Insights from Interview

### On Emergency Supply Chains
*"In the last 6 years since COVID, our supply chains have gotten really slow. What was once available in weeks now takes months."*

*"I had an example even this morning... simple nuts and bolts that I needed for pressure vessel inspection... took a week and a half to get them from the supplier."*

→ **Translation:** This is weekly reality for tier-1 O&G operators. Supply chain delays are built into operational planning.

### On Automatic Inventory Management
*"If we carry a small stock offshore, and we keep what's called a 'safety stock.' So when the inventory amount drops to a certain point, there's an automatic reward to refill it. But instead of refilling in logistics by shipping stuff onshore, if we could print components offshore in a way of just being an automatic process... that would be fantastic."*

→ **Translation:** This is AddManuChain's exact use case. Build for automatic threshold-triggered printing.

### On Proprietary Parts Challenge
*"We pay a lot of money for spare parts from these vendors. If we could get around that [proprietary designs] it would be a very big win."*

→ **Translation:** Long-term opportunity is huge, but start with commodity parts (20%) and gradually expand.

### On Downtime Economics
*"We operate offshore gas facilities... repair techniques are limited... downtime is expensive."* (Implied: ~$100K+/day)

→ **Translation:** Justifies premium pricing for on-time delivery; ROI case is strong.

David's insights directly validate the on-site printing + automatic inventory management thesis. This is not theoretical—he faces these emergencies weekly and explicitly stated the solution would be "fantastic."

**For Go-to-Market:**
David represents the ideal customer profile for AddManuChain:
- Tier-1 operator (large budgets, mission-critical infrastructure)
- Frequent emergencies (weekly supply chain failures)
- High downtime costs (ROI case is easy to model)
- Regulatory expertise (understands certification pathway)
- Openness to innovation (mentioned multiple alternative solutions)

**For Funding/Validation:**
David's immediate, specific use case articulation ("automatic printing when inventory drops") is a powerful signal to investors that AddManuChain is solving a real, high-value problem.
