## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

This is potentially the **most strategically important interview in the entire Lab2Market program**. Scott and Heather represent Aker Solutions — the Tier 1 EPC contractor for Hebron (ExxonMobil), one of the largest offshore platforms in Newfoundland. Together, they lead Aker's digitalization effort in St. John's. Here's why:

1. **Tier 1 EPC contractor perspective** — Aker Solutions is the engineering services contractor for Hebron, one of NL's major offshore platforms. They sit between the operator (ExxonMobil) and the manufacturers (including Atlantic XL). They specify parts, manage design reviews, and control engineering workflows. If AddManuChain is going to work in NL offshore, it must work for Aker.

2. **Digitalization decision-makers** — Scott and Heather are not just users of digital tools — they are the people who evaluate, select, and implement them. Scott implemented CoLab to cut design review cycles from weeks to days. Heather leads Omega 365 rollout. These are the people who would evaluate AddManuChain for adoption.

3. **Atlantic XL connection confirmed** — Dwayne Hopkins confirmed that Aker Solutions works directly with Atlantic XL (Sean Morgan, John Lidstone) on AM pilot projects. This interview can validate the real workflow between designer (Aker) → manufacturer (Atlantic XL) → platform (AddManuChain).

4. **Certification expertise from the designer side** — Heather spent 12+ years at DNV doing structural certification for offshore units. She was the Teamcenter SME for design reviews and certifications. She knows exactly what it takes to certify an AM-produced part for offshore use — from the designer's perspective, not the regulator's.

5. **CoLab + AI adoption precedent** — Scott's CoLab implementation ($5.6M ExxonMobil partnership, 125 users, 2,900 reviews) proves Aker is actively spending money on digital tools for engineering workflows. This is a live precedent for how AddManuChain could be adopted.

6. **Tyler Beatty referral network** — Tyler Beatty (Interview #33) specifically flagged a "Ladna/Lachna (Aker Solutions AM Lead)" as a referral target. Scott and Heather can connect us to the AM-specific people inside Aker's global organization.

7. **Hopkins' gateway** — Dwayne Hopkins said Heather "will help you for sure to get the first interview and she might be able to put you on to the next person." She's not just an interview — she's a gateway to Aker's entire digitalization team and their offshore AM clients.

## INTERVIEW GOALS

- [ ] Understand Aker's current workflow for identifying AM-candidate parts on Hebron and other NL offshore platforms
- [ ] Test whether AddManuChain fills a gap between Aker's digitalization tools (CoLab, Omega 365, Teamcenter) and the AM production workflow at Atlantic XL
- [ ] Understand the certification process from the designer's perspective — what does it take to sign off an AM part for offshore use?
- [ ] Validate the "digital spare parts inventory" concept with people who actually manage engineering data for offshore assets
- [ ] Learn about Aker's relationship with Atlantic XL — is AM already in production, or still pilot-stage?
- [ ] Get referrals to Aker's global AM lead (Ladna/Lachna per Tyler Beatty), procurement, and NL offshore operators (ExxonMobil, Equinor)

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

**Q1 — The digitalization roadmap at Aker:**
> *"Scott, you've led the CoLab implementation at Hebron — 2,900 design reviews, cutting cycles from weeks to days. Heather, you're driving Omega 365 for project and asset management. Together, you're digitizing the engineering workflow at Aker. Where does spare parts and manufacturing fit into that roadmap? Is there a digital thread that goes from 'designer identifies a part' all the way to 'part is manufactured and installed offshore' — or does the chain break somewhere?"*

**Follow-ups:** Where is the biggest gap in the digital thread today? Is the manufacturing handoff still paper-based or email-driven? Does the engineer who designs a replacement part track what happens to it after the design file leaves Aker?

---

**Q2 — AM part identification — the designer's lens:**
> *"Heather, Dwayne Hopkins told us you're one of the people who identifies which components are AM candidates. When you look at a part on Hebron or another offshore asset and decide 'this could be 3D-printed' — what's your decision process? What criteria matter: geometry, material, criticality, lead time of the original OEM part? And how many parts on a typical offshore platform would you estimate are realistic AM candidates today?"*

**Follow-ups:** Is there a formal AM screening process at Aker, or is it ad hoc? Do you use any software tools to flag AM candidates, or is it engineering judgment? Would an AI tool that automatically screens parts and generates business case analysis be useful — or would you not trust it?

---

**Q3 — The Aker-to-Atlantic XL workflow:**
> *"We've spoken with Sean Morgan and John Lidstone at Atlantic XL — the Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility in St. John's. We know Aker works with them. Can you walk us through the real workflow: when Aker identifies a part that could be AM-printed, what happens next? Who initiates the request? Who does the engineering review? How does the certification happen? And where are the friction points that slow it down or kill the project?"*

**Follow-ups:** How long does the end-to-end process take from 'AM candidate identified' to 'part installed offshore'? What percentage of AM candidates actually make it to production? Who has authority to approve an AM part for offshore use — Aker, the operator (ExxonMobil), the classification society (LR/DNV), or all three?

---

**Q4 — Certification cost and timeline — the real numbers:**
> *"Heather, you spent 12 years at DNV doing structural certification for offshore units — FPSOs, semi-submersibles, TLPs. You know the certification process from the inside. For AM-produced parts going onto an offshore platform in NL waters: what does the certification actually cost? How long does it take? And is it a one-time qualification per part design (qualify once, reproduce without re-certifying), or does every single print run need its own certification?"*

**Follow-ups:** Is the certification barrier technical (can't prove the part meets spec) or bureaucratic (the process is slow and expensive)? Would a platform that manages the certification documentation automatically — 'Certification-as-a-Service' — make a meaningful difference? What does C-NLOPB specifically require for AM parts vs. traditionally manufactured parts?

---

**Q5 — Where does AddManuChain fit in Aker's world?**
> *"You're both evaluating digital tools for Aker — CoLab for design review, Omega 365 for asset management. If a platform existed that let Aker store qualified part designs digitally, send them to a certified AM facility like Atlantic XL for on-demand production, and handle the certification documentation automatically — would that plug into your existing digitalization roadmap? Or does it conflict with tools you already have? And who at Aker would make the decision to adopt something like that?"*

**Follow-ups:** Would this be a 'nice-to-have' or a 'must-have'? What would the business case need to show — lead time reduction, cost savings, downtime avoidance? Is there a digitalization budget at Aker St. John's that this would compete for, or would funding come from the operator (ExxonMobil)?

---

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

**B1 — The Aker global AM network:**
> *"Tyler Beatty at FieldNode mentioned an AM Lead at Aker Solutions globally — someone named Ladna or Lachna. Are you connected to Aker's global AM program? Is there a corporate-level initiative for digital spare parts or AM-based manufacturing that the St. John's office is participating in — or is the local NL effort self-directed?"*

---

**B2 — Referrals into the operator and the ecosystem:**
> *"Three specific asks: First, within Aker — can you connect us with whoever leads the AM or digital manufacturing agenda globally? Second, on the operator side — is there someone at ExxonMobil (Hebron/Hibernia) who owns spare parts strategy and would give us 20 minutes? Third, in the NL ecosystem — beyond Atlantic XL, who else is working on digital manufacturing for offshore that we should talk to?"*

## CONTEXT TO SHARE WITH SCOTT & HEATHER

- AddManuChain: Canadian platform for digital spare parts inventory + AM production + certification-as-a-service
- We've done 51 interviews so far — including with Atlantic XL (Sean Morgan, John Lidstone), Equinor (Douglas Garcia-Golindano), Lloyd's Register, Irving Shipbuilding, C-CORE, and multiple NL ecosystem players
- Lloyd's Register certified Atlantic XL as the first AM facility in the Americas — our anchor manufacturing partner
- Tyler Beatty at FieldNode flagged the Aker → Atlantic XL → Operator workflow as critical to understand
- Dwayne Hopkins specifically recommended Heather as the "designer perspective" we were missing
- We believe the gap between "part identified as AM candidate" and "part certified and installed" is where the most value is lost — and where AddManuChain sits
- We're fellow Newfoundland/Atlantic Canada researchers (Dalhousie PhD, Lab2Market at Memorial)

## IMPORTANT NOTES ON FRAMING

**This is a joint interview — play to both strengths.**
- **Scott** is the digitalization leader and technology evaluator. He thinks about roadmaps, tools, ROI, and implementation. Ask him about how tools get adopted and what the decision process looks like.
- **Heather** is the engineer with deep certification and design review expertise. She thinks about whether a part can actually be trusted. Ask her about the technical and regulatory barriers.

**Don't pitch — ask for their workflow.** The most valuable output of this interview is a detailed understanding of the Aker workflow from part identification to AM production. If you can map that workflow and identify the gaps, you have the basis for a product that Aker would actually use.

**The CoLab precedent is your best proof point.** Scott already convinced Aker to deploy a digital tool (CoLab) that cut review cycles from weeks to days. Ask him what it took to make that happen — the same playbook applies to AddManuChain adoption.

**Heather is the gateway.** Hopkins said she can open doors. End the interview with clear referral asks — Aker global AM lead, ExxonMobil spare parts, and any other NL operators.
