## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: Arctic Offshore Logistics & Spare Parts Challenges ❄️
**"With your extensive experience in Arctic offshore engineering—including what are the biggest challenges in getting critical spare parts to Arctic offshore platforms? Can you walk me through a specific example where a component failure created a logistics nightmare, and what it cost in terms of downtime, emergency shipping, and lost production?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates Keith's Arctic niche**: "Warehouse heating costs in the Arctic are astronomical"
- **Quantifies downtime costs**: Arctic offshore downtime is extremely expensive
- **Tests logistics pain**: Ice roads, helicopter weather delays, sealift seasonality

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Extreme logistics costs**: "Helicopter charters to Arctic sites can cost $50K+ per trip"
- ✅ **Seasonal constraints**: "Sealift only runs 2-3 months per year; ice roads close in spring"
- ✅ **Massive inventory stockpiling**: "Platforms keep $10M+ in spare parts because resupply is so difficult"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Arctic logistics aren't really a problem anymore" (invalidates niche)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's the longest you've seen a platform wait for a critical part in the Arctic?"
- "Do Arctic platforms stockpile more spare parts than temperate-region platforms? How much more?"
- "Have you seen platforms cannibalize parts from one system to keep another running?"
- "What percentage of Arctic logistics budget goes to emergency/expedited shipping?"
- "If you could manufacture parts locally in St. John's or on-platform, how much would that save?"

### Q2: C-CORE Certification Pathway for AM Parts 🔬
**"You spent 10 years at C-CORE as a Research Engineer, and I know they're involved in validating offshore technologies for regulators. If we wanted to get additively manufactured parts certified for use in offshore oil & gas—say, a pipeline component or a platform structural part—could C-CORE help with that? What would the testing, validation, and certification process look like?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates Keith's C-CORE mention**: Keith said "Contact C-CORE" for certification
- **Identifies regulatory pathway**: What standards apply (DNV, Lloyd's, C-NLOPB)?
- **Tests feasibility**: Is AM certification realistic, or is it a deal-breaker?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **C-CORE can help**: "Yes, C-CORE does material testing and validation for offshore applications"
- ✅ **Specific standards**: "You'd need DNV-GL certification, Lloyd's Register approval, and C-NLOPB sign-off"
- ✅ **Testing requirements**: "Fatigue testing, environmental testing (salt spray, freeze-thaw), failure analysis"
- ✅ **Pathway exists**: "If the AM part meets the same standards as OEM parts, it can be approved"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "C-NLOPB would never approve AM parts for critical infrastructure" (deal-breaker)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Do you still have connections at C-CORE? Could you introduce us?"
- "What's the typical timeline and cost for certifying a new offshore component?"
- "Would you accept AM parts for non-critical components (housings, brackets) before critical parts?"
- "Are there any offshore projects that have already used AM parts successfully?"
- "What's the liability concern for engineers approving AM parts?"

### Q3: Critical Offshore Components & Obsolescence 🛢️
**"In your work as a technical advisor for offshore pipelines and structures, what components fail most often or are hardest to source? Are there specific parts—valves, flanges, structural brackets, pump components—that have long lead times, are obsolete, or require minimum order quantities that don't make sense for a single platform?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Identifies target parts**: What should we focus on first?
- **Validates <50-unit threshold**: Andrew said AM only works for low-volume parts
- **Tests obsolescence hypothesis**: Are offshore platforms struggling with obsolete parts?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Specific components**: "Subsea valve actuators, pipeline flanges, and structural brackets are always problematic"
- ✅ **Obsolescence pain**: "Platforms built in the 1990s have parts that are no longer manufactured"
- ✅ **Long lead times**: "Some specialty valves take 6-12 months to source"
- ✅ **MOQ problems**: "OEMs require minimum orders of 100 units, but we only need 2-3"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We can always source parts quickly" (no opportunity)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which offshore platforms in Atlantic Canada have the worst obsolescence issues?"
- "Do you know if Equinor Bay du Nord is planning for spare parts procurement?"
- "What's the typical inventory value for a Newfoundland offshore platform?"
- "Have you seen platforms share parts with each other (like Andrew Smith's helicopter sharing)?"
- "What parts would you NEVER approve as AM vs. what parts are low-risk?"

### Q4: Bay du Nord Project & Equinor Connection 🎯
**"I know Worley/Intecsea has been involved in major offshore projects in Atlantic Canada. Are you familiar with the Equinor Bay du Nord project? If so, what do you know about their spare parts strategy, and do you have any connections to Equinor or ERINL (Energy Research and Innovation Newfoundland and Labrador) that you could share?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates beachhead hypothesis**: Keith said Bay du Nord is our Greenfield opportunity
- **Tests network access**: Can Mike introduce us to Equinor or ERINL?
- **Explores funding**: ERINL will fund certification costs (Keith's insight)

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Knows the project**: "Yes, I'm familiar with Bay du Nord—it's a major Greenfield development"
- ✅ **Spare parts insight**: "Greenfield projects like Bay du Nord are rethinking traditional inventory models"
- ✅ **Willing to introduce**: "I can connect you with [name] at Equinor or ERINL"
- ✅ **ERINL funding**: "ERINL has programs for offshore technology innovation"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "I don't know the project" or "I can't make introductions" (no network access)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Is Bay du Nord planning to use digital inventory or just-in-time procurement?"
- "Who at Equinor or ERINL should we talk to about spare parts innovation?"
- "What's the timeline for Bay du Nord first oil? When should we engage?"
- "Are there other Greenfield offshore projects in Atlantic Canada we should know about?"
- "Could ERINL fund a pilot project for AM parts certification?"

### Q5: Academic Collaboration & Memorial University R&D 🎓
**"As an Adjunct Professor at Memorial University, do you see opportunities for academic-industry collaboration on additive manufacturing for offshore applications? Could Memorial's engineering department partner on R&D, material testing, or graduate student projects related to AM parts for Arctic and offshore environments?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Explores R&D funding**: Academic partnerships can access NSERC, MITACS, etc.
- **Tests technical feasibility**: Can Memorial validate AM for offshore use?
- **Builds credibility**: Academic research strengthens our certification case

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Strong interest**: "Memorial has excellent facilities for materials testing and Arctic research"
- ✅ **Funding opportunities**: "We could apply for NSERC or MITACS funding for this"
- ✅ **Graduate student projects**: "This would make a great MASc or PhD thesis topic"
- ✅ **Collaboration willingness**: "I'd be happy to supervise a student on this project"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Memorial isn't interested in AM research" (no academic pathway)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which Memorial professors are working on materials science or Arctic engineering?"
- "Could we access Memorial's testing facilities (fatigue testing, environmental chambers)?"
- "Are there existing industry partnerships we could join (C-CORE, ERINL, Equinor)?"
- "What would a pilot R&D project look like? Timeline? Budget?"
- "Could Memorial students help with CAD library development or material qualification?"
