- **Critical spare parts**: What components fail most often
- **Certification requirements**: DNV, Lloyd's Register, C-NLOPB
- **Downtime costs**: What it costs when a pipeline or platform component fails

### 4. **Bay du Nord Region Knowledge** 🎯
Mike worked on **Sakhalin 1** (Arctic Russia) and has been with **Worley/Intecsea** for 15+ years. He likely knows:
- **Equinor Bay du Nord project**: Our beachhead opportunity
- **Offshore Newfoundland regulations**: C-NLOPB requirements
- **Local supply chain**: Who supplies parts to offshore platforms

### 5. **Academic & Industry Bridge** 🎓
As an **Adjunct Professor at Memorial University** since 2010, Mike:
- Connects industry and academia (potential R&D partnerships)
- Has access to graduate students and research funding
- Can validate the technical feasibility of AM for offshore applications

### 6. **International Project Experience** 🌍
Mike worked on **Sakhalin 1** (Russia), **Worley** (global), and **ExxonMobil** (international). He understands:
- **Global supply chains**: How parts are sourced internationally
- **Cross-border certification**: What it takes to approve parts for multiple jurisdictions
- **Sovereign capability**: Why countries want domestic manufacturing

## Key Questions to Explore

1. **Arctic logistics**: What are the biggest challenges getting parts to Arctic offshore sites?
2. **C-CORE certification**: Can C-CORE help certify AM parts for offshore use?
3. **Pipeline component failures**: What parts fail most often and are hardest to source?
4. **Bay du Nord knowledge**: Does he know the Equinor project? Can he introduce us?
5. **Regulatory pathways**: What would it take to get AM parts approved by C-NLOPB?

## Interview Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Validate Arctic niche**: Confirm that Arctic logistics are a nightmare (Keith's insight)
2. **Explore C-CORE partnership**: Can they certify AM parts?
3. **Identify critical components**: What offshore parts are most problematic?
4. **Test certification pathway**: What standards apply (DNV, Lloyd's, C-NLOPB)?
5. **Bay du Nord connection**: Can he introduce us to Equinor or ERINL?

### Bonus Insights
1. **Academic collaboration**: Could Memorial University partner on R&D?
2. **International markets**: Are there Arctic projects in other countries (Norway, Russia, Alaska)?

## Connection to Week 6 Insights

### Aligns With:
- ✅ **Keith Healey's Arctic niche**: Mike is THE Arctic expert
- ✅ **Keith's C-CORE mention**: Mike spent 10 years there
- ✅ **Keith's Bay du Nord beachhead**: Mike likely knows the project
- ✅ **Andrew's certification barrier**: Mike knows DNV/Lloyd's requirements
- ✅ **Kwadwo's working capital**: Offshore platforms stockpile massive spare parts

### Validates:
- ✅ **Extreme logistics**: Arctic offshore is the hardest environment
- ✅ **Certification complexity**: Mike can explain the regulatory maze
- ✅ **Critical infrastructure**: Pipeline/platform components are life-critical

### New Opportunities:
- 🆕 **C-CORE certification partnership**: Direct pathway to regulatory approval
- 🆕 **Memorial University R&D**: Academic collaboration and funding
- 🆕 **International Arctic markets**: Norway, Russia, Alaska, Greenland

## Interview Strategy

### Approach
- **Emphasize Arctic sovereignty**: "How can Canada reduce dependence on foreign supply chains for Arctic operations?"
- **Focus on C-CORE**: "Could C-CORE help validate AM parts for offshore use?"
- **Explore certification**: "What would it take to get AM parts approved by C-NLOPB?"

### Avoid
- ❌ Over-promising on certification (he's a Ph.D. and P.Eng.—he'll be highly skeptical)
- ❌ Ignoring safety concerns (offshore is life-critical)
- ❌ Assuming he'll introduce us to clients (he's a consultant—he protects relationships)

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case
- Mike sees AM as a **strategic capability** for Arctic sovereignty
- He provides **detailed insights** on certification pathways (C-CORE, DNV, C-NLOPB)
- He offers to **introduce us to C-CORE** or **Memorial University** for R&D collaboration
- He identifies **specific offshore components** that are problematic (obsolete, long lead times)
- He connects us with **Equinor Bay du Nord** or **ERINL**

### Worst Case
- He's **skeptical about certification** and liability for AM parts
- He sees **no business case** for AM in offshore applications
- He's **protective of client relationships** and won't make introductions

### Most Likely
- He acknowledges the **pain point** (Arctic logistics, obsolete parts)
- He's **cautiously interested** but wants to see proof of certification
- He provides **valuable insights** on regulatory pathways and C-CORE
- He's **open to academic collaboration** through Memorial University
- He suggests **starting with non-critical components** (housings, brackets) before moving to critical parts
