# Interview Analysis: Aaron Plamondon, Ph.D.
**Interview #34 — Director of ITB, Irving Shipbuilding**  
**Date:** February 13, 2026  

---

## Executive Summary

This interview with Aaron Plamondon provided **critical insider intelligence** on how defence procurement, additive manufacturing, and Irving Shipbuilding's in-service support pipeline actually work. Aaron confirmed every major hypothesis about certification barriers while revealing a **time-sensitive opportunity** — a February 18 visit to Dalhousie with the Fleet Admiral to evaluate AM capabilities.

### Top-Line Verdict
**The Navy's AM adoption is entirely blocked by a leadership decision that hasn't been made yet — but that decision may happen on February 18th at Dalhousie.**

---

## 🔑 Key Findings

### 1. ITB Process — "You're Doing It Right Now"
Aaron confirmed the ITB process is **not bureaucratic but relational**. There's no formal application — you pitch to ITB managers at defence primes.

**Critical Insight:** Aaron was very clear:
> *"The real thing you want to zone in on is: why would I do it? Which really means, why would Irving do it? What's in it for Irving?"*

| What Works | What Doesn't |
|---|---|
| Business cases showing value to Irving & Navy | Saying "you have an obligation, you need me" |
| Solving a real company problem while meeting ITB credits | Not knowing Irving's existing plan |
| University or small business multipliers on funding | Pure technology pitches without business case |

**💡 Action Item for AddManuChain:** Frame the pitch as: "Here's how digital inventory solves Irving's Halifax-class maintenance data problem AND generates ITB credit through university R&D."

### 2. The Navy AM Failure — "We've Never Been Successful"
Aaron admitted something remarkable — **Irving and MAMCE invested in AM but never got a single part produced for the Navy.** Despite years of effort.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Fear of risk** — "There's lives at stake, it's super scary for someone to agree to that"
2. **No certification standard** — "I don't think there IS a certification level"
3. **No testing infrastructure** — Only ~2 companies in Canada do shock/vibration testing for defence
4. **No admiral's signature** — "Until the Navy says 'go do this,' we're not going to get anywhere"
5. **Material uncertainty** — "I don't think anyone has enough trust in the material to say in 5 years that's not going to break"

**💡 Implication:** This validates the **massive gap** AddManuChain is trying to fill. Even Canada's largest shipbuilder, with university partnerships and MAMCE's powder research, couldn't crack AM adoption. The barrier isn't technology — it's governance, testing, and trust.

### 3. ⏰ THE FEB 18 OPPORTUNITY — Fleet Admiral Visiting Dalhousie
This is the **most time-sensitive and valuable piece of intelligence** from all interviews to date:

> *"I'm going to Dalhousie to see Dal's capabilities in this area on the 18th. And the Admiral of the Fleet is going as well."*

**Aaron's Plan:**
1. Visit Dal on Feb 18 with the Fleet Admiral
2. Ask her: "Do you see a path? Do you want to do this?"
3. If she says yes → Navy officials will be assigned to execute
4. Aaron will put **Irving funding behind it** if Navy gives the green light
5. Aaron will share the outcome with Michael ~1 week after (around Feb 25)

**💡 Action Items:**
- [ ] **Contact Dalhousie AM lab** before Feb 18 — ensure AddManuChain is on their radar
- [ ] **Follow up with Aaron by Feb 25** — get the Admiral's response
- [ ] **Prepare business case** that links AddManuChain to whatever the Navy says yes to
- [ ] **Position AddManuChain as the platform layer** on top of whatever AM testing/production Dal proposes

### 4. AOPS In-Service Support → Thales, Not Irving

**Critical clarification that changes the customer map:**

| Program | Who Manages Spares | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **AOPS** (Arctic & Offshore Patrol Ship) | **Thales** — won the in-service support contract | 6 Navy ships complete; 2 Coast Guard ships remaining (7 & 8) |
| **Halifax Class** (frigates) | **Irving Ship Repair** | 20+ years of maintenance data |

> *"The in-service support lead is 100% — that's all going through Thales."*

**💡 Implication:** Lee Vessey (Thales) is already confirmed as the right contact for AOPS spare parts. But Irving's **Halifax class ship repair** is a SEPARATE opportunity — and they own that data directly.

---

### 5. MAMCE Board — Stalled / Inactive

Aaron hasn't been active on the **MAMCE board in over a year**. He confirmed:
- MAMCE had "all kinds of ideas" but none materialized
- Fundamental block: couldn't get the Navy to say "go try this"
- Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi was focused on **powder development and material certification**
- Aaron and Mohsen have "kind of lost touch"

**💡 Implication:** MAMCE may be a stalled initiative. AddManuChain shouldn't count on it as a current resource — but Dr. Mohammadi's materials expertise could still be valuable if the Feb 18 visit reignites AM interest.

---

### 6. DeepSense at Dalhousie — Data Analytics Connection

Aaron mentioned working with **IBM and DeepSense through Dal** on a predictive maintenance project.

**What is DeepSense?**
- Ocean data innovation environment at Dalhousie University, Halifax
- Uses AI/ML for ocean sector data challenges
- Partnership between industry, academia, and government
- IBM high-performance computing infrastructure
- Focus areas: fisheries, shipping, offshore energy, environmental monitoring

> *"Their focus is data analytics. It sounds somewhat potentially linked to the work you do."*

**The failed project:** Irving tried to build a predictive maintenance system for Halifax class ships using DeepSense. Dal estimated **3 years to figure it out** — Irving said "too long, business works faster." L3 Harris then took the lead.

**💡 Action Item:** Contact DeepSense at Dal — potential collaboration on the AI/data analytics layer of AddManuChain.

---

### 7. L3 Harris — Leads on Predictive Maintenance

Aaron revealed that **L3 Harris (L3 MAPPS, Montreal)** took the lead on Navy predictive maintenance:
- Provides IPMS (Integrated Platform Management System) for Halifax class
- Seized a data release from National Defence
- Were "way faster" than Irving/DeepSense
- Canada HQ in Montreal
- Also doing IPMS for CSC (Canadian Surface Combatant)
- Developing digital twin technology for real-time maintenance updates

**💡 Implication:** L3 Harris is the **incumbant** on Navy predictive maintenance. AddManuChain needs to either partner with them or differentiate clearly. They're also doing the IPMS for CSC, making them a long-term player.

---

### 8. Data Quality — The AI Blocker

Aaron confirmed what Shawn Sooley also flagged — **data quality is the #1 barrier to AI in Navy maintenance:**

> *"AI is only as good as the collection of the data. And that part is just a little too unwieldy at the moment."*

> *"The data is massive. Some of it's not digital. Some of it's pen and paper, spreadsheets."*

Irving's ship repair division said last week: **"Obviously the future. But the data just isn't good enough for us to plug it in."**

**💡 Implication:** The AI/ML component of AddManuChain needs to be positioned as helping **digitize and organize** the data first, not as a plug-and-play AI solution.

---

### 9. Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) — Key Concept

Aaron introduced the concept of **ILS (Integrated Logistics Support)** — a military term for comprehensive lifecycle management:
- Every component on a Navy ship has an ILS plan
- Includes maintenance schedules, manuals, parts lists
- Linked to preventive maintenance
- "Lots of information — massive"

**💡 Implication:** AddManuChain's digital inventory concept maps directly to ILS modernization. Frame the platform as an **ILS digitization tool** when talking to defence customers.
