## Introduction & Background

**Michael:** Thank you very much for being here today. I know your schedule is so busy. I really really appreciate it. So let me just introduce myself a little bit. My name is Mahmoud Kiasari, and I'm doing my PhD at Dalhousie University right now. Around 2 years ago I was working with a company in a MITACS project, and they had an idea about digital inventory and additive manufacturing. Recently I got accepted in the program named Lab2Market. In this program, they encourage us as young entrepreneurs to talk with experts like you — at least hundreds of them — in order to get the idea of how we have to change the project that we do have in our mind. Is it okay for the market or not? So throughout this program, I have to reach out to you guys and ask for meetings with just a bunch of questions. I really would like to know your honest answers and ideas — that would be so helpful to me. Could you introduce yourself a little bit more? I love the information from your LinkedIn, but that will be better to hear from you.

**Aaron:** Yeah, it's good that everyone's resume is online now so you can kind of figure out what people are doing. So I was doing academic work to start — I did everything military going through school. I did mostly Canadian-American relations, but mostly **defense procurement, defense economics**, things like that. And then when I realized I didn't want to teach — the idea was always I was going to go back to industry, because that was my area of interest: defense procurement, which makes more sense to be involved on the ground with it.

So then I transferred over to a company called **Raytheon** — big defense company. They had real struggles with Canadian content and how to do things locally. **A lot of things they do, you're not actually able to do in Canada, such as create missiles.** So we had to do all kinds of other investing and R&D. So that kind of cut my teeth on the ITB policy.

And **Irving had the same problem** — how do we invest more back into the country? And so I came here almost **10 years ago**, and I've been doing that job ever since.

## The Additive Manufacturing Initiative at Irving

**Aaron:** Now the additive manufacturing thing — that was really almost an ideal project. We looked at: **how can we do something that is in our customers' interest — the Navy — buy something new that would also help the university, and therefore get extra credit for it?** Because there's multipliers when you do R&D.

So we got **UNB involved**, but also the affiliate — we got **Dalhousie** involved. The machine itself went to **CFN** (a machine and fabrication shop).

**So we did all that, but we never really got what we were looking for yet.** Because the idea was, okay, we can eventually find components on our ships that we're building for the Navy and be able to **reproduce spare parts and really have in-service support for the Navy on an additive basis** — where you can say, "Look, we'll just build this either onboard or at the Fleet Maintenance Facility."

**And we've never been successful at that. We've never found a thing where either us or the Navy said, "Here, let's try this thing. Let's see if this thing is..."**

And I don't know if it's **fear, lack of experience, risk** — I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's unknown. You know:
- Is the powder right?
- Is the metal right?
- Is it test resistant?
- Is the shock gonna pass?
- All the certifications — are we too far behind to go through the process?

**I've come to the conclusion that until the Navy — and by that it's almost the head Admiral of the Fleet — says, "Go do this. Show me an item that you can reproduce and start figuring out how to do this thing" — even at sea — we're not going to get anywhere.** So I think that's where we're at.

---

## Lee Vessey / Thales Connection

**Michael:** So the very first reason that I came to you — actually I was talking with **Mr. Lee Vessey**. He's working at **Thales**, and he was also working in the Navy and this kind of technologies. And then I came up with my idea and said I'm working on this area. He also showed a little bit of interest in that.

One thing that you mentioned really caught my eye — especially about talking with different kinds of industries. It's not just about the Navy — other oil and gas too. Because my main focus at first was about **oil and gas and offshore and remote industries**. They are saying the exact same thing. **Apparently there is not enough trust with AM.** So I found different reasons for that. The very first reason is about the **certification and regulations** — especially talking with **Lloyd's, DNV**, or any kind of registration parts.

So from your point of view — you mentioned that Canada would like to invest more in order to make most things localized, because we have some problems maybe with the US, and sometimes because of the supply chain with Europe. So we would like to have everything in-house. How do you see this kind of reasoning helping us tackle this specific problem about dealing with registration and certification?

---

## Certification — The Core Barrier

**Aaron:** Well, I'll walk through how I see these things. **The certification from Lloyd's obviously must be met on any new item on a ship.** So in order for us to change or do anything, it really has to factor into — how long will that take? Right?

Do we have time? And **usually the answer is no.** Usually the answer is, "I don't want to add a year to this game."

Two — **do we have the capability to do it?** Is there a machine shop, fabrication shop? Is there a testing shop that can undergo that **shock testing, vibration, cold, hot** — whatever it's going to take? Can it all be there, ready to go? And **usually the answer is no to that too.**

**There's probably 2 companies in the whole country that I know of** — there's probably more, but I only know of 2 — **that do shock and vibration testing for defense.** So already you're limited.

And then what I've encountered was **professors working on the powders themselves, trying to advance the tensile strength** of whatever that item might be. And really, **I don't think there is a certification level. I don't think there's something that someone can point to and go, "Oh well, if you make that component, it has to be made out of this and this and this"** — because those things are all still being developed.

**So I don't think anyone has enough trust in the material to say, "In 5 years, that's not going to break."**

And so I think there's a ton of fear of that. You know, you look at a **gearbox on a helicopter** — those things crash as a result of broken bolts and titanium failures. So I think there's just a ton of fear putting something new onboard a destroyer that is really meant to **protect the sailors and the country's borders** — and the risk is enormous.

**So who's signing that piece of paper to say, "Yeah, I'm willing to try this"? There's just lives at stake, and it's super scary for someone to agree to that.**

So I think **the testing part — Dalhousie might be perfectly set up for this.** Where you say, "Look, we've tested this a thousand times. We couldn't test it anymore. It's not gonna fail in a hundred years. It's just not." And **until that is complete and you provide that study to the Admiral who has to sign the paper — that's what's missing.**

## Q1: ITB Process — How Can a Startup Benefit?

**Michael:** So as a Director of ITB at Irving Shipbuilding, you manage what I understand is a multibillion-dollar obligation to reinvest into Canadian companies. For a startup like ours — focused on digital inventory and on-demand AM — how does the ITB process work? I had a meeting with Thales, and we got a sense of the demand — they see spare part challenges as a problem, especially with the Navy.

**Aaron:** Well, **you're doing it.** So it's really pitches to the ITB managers in the defense companies. I think there's no formal process. It's just more you making contact with people like me to say, "Look, we have obligations to meet in all kinds of different ways, and you have an idea that could be something we would invest in."

**The real thing you want to zone in on is: why would I do it? Which really means, why would Irving do it?** What's in it for Irving? We can probably figure out what's in it for you very easily, but **what's in it for the company becomes super important.**

Because lots of companies will come to the ITB managers and they'll say, **"I saw you have an obligation online. It's really big. You need me."** And **that's absolutely not how it works.**

I can do **100 different things a year.** And they are all kind of planned and forecasted already. I have a plan already. And it obviously doesn't involve you at the moment because we're just starting the conversation.

**If you present a business plan that will help my company AND help me solve my obligation at the same time — well, now I'm interested.** So it really comes down to the business case. Always focus on that — never really on the obligation.

Because you really don't know how the company is planning to do that. They might have a 100% plan already. So always be thinking of that.

As far as the process goes — like I said, you're doing it right. It's really just **pitching ideas and saying, "This is how this can be appealing because it will deliver this to the Navy customer"** — which is a good thing. Maybe there's something in it for the company itself.

And then because you're at a university — **if any funding goes to your project, there's a multiplier of credit.** Or if it goes to what you turn into a small business, there's a multiplier on credit. So **you have to really focus on what's the appeal to the investor.**

---

## Q2: UNB MAMCE — Board Update

**Michael:** So you sit on the board of the UNB Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence — MAMCE. And I believe you are also working with Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi?

**Aaron:** So I used to. **Here's the update for you, which is not gonna be as helpful — I haven't been active on that board in over a year**, so I don't really know what's happening with them.

But I can tell you the history has been — **we had all kinds of ideas. It never happened because we could never get the Navy to say, "Go try this."**

And Mohsen was really, from what I can figure out, **a leader in his field** — really the guy trying to say, "I am trying to make the powders and test the powders that will be something that the Navy would certify — something that Lloyd's would say, 'Yes, this batch of this material is exactly what we need.'"

And so he was always pushing for new and better powder to use, but **I haven't talked to him in over a year.** We've kind of lost touch.

## Q3: AOPS Spare Parts & Thales In-Service Support

**Michael:** Irving is building the Arctic and Offshore Patrol Ships and other related projects — these are multi-decade programs. From your point of view, what does the spare parts supply chain look like for these vessels over a 30-year lifecycle?

**Aaron:** So we're building the **AOPS — Arctic and Offshore Patrol Ship.** We're building **6 of those for the Navy**, which we've essentially completed, and **we have 2 left for the Coast Guard.** So we're on ships 7 and 8.

The real thing that happens with the ship now is that **once we turn it over to the Navy, the in-service support aspect is between them and Thales — because Thales won the contract to run the in-service support.** We do not do it.

So **Thales is the one that works with the Navy**, the Fleet Maintenance Facility — which is just down the road from me. They work with all the **OEMs — the original equipment manufacturers**, the companies that supplied the parts to the ship itself, and **they are the ones to manage the spares.**

**Michael:** It's good to know. I probably have to have another meeting with them to get more information.

**Aaron:** **The in-service support lead is 100% — that's all going through Thales.**

---

## Q4: COVE & Startup Advice

**Michael:** As a COVE board member, you've seen dozens of ocean tech startups. From your experience, what separates the startups that succeed from those that fail?

**Aaron:** So I'm hesitating to answer because **I've never been part of a startup** and I'm really just an observer. So I've never really been part of it. I would hate to give you advice in an area that I do not profess expertise. **I've only ever worked for giant companies.**

Anyone within COVE — they'll talk about it all day with you. Both, you know, what they thought worked and what didn't. But **I'm probably the wrong guy.**

---

## Q5: Certification Acceleration — The Dalhousie Visit & The Admiral

**Michael:** Back to the main problem about certifications. From talking with different people, I found out the #1 barrier to AM adoption isn't about the technology — it's about the certifications and trust. Do you see a pathway that maybe we can accelerate this process, especially about the Navy and maritime?

**Aaron:** Yeah, so **this topic has come up again recently.** It's kind of becoming — not a new thing certainly, but **it's being reinvigorated.**

**So I'm going to Dalhousie to see Dal's capabilities in this area on the 18th.**

**Michael:** Really?

**Aaron:** Yeah. **And the Admiral of the Fleet is going as well.**

So after that day, I'm gonna reach out to her and say, "What did you think?" And I'm gonna say, **"How do we do this? Do you see a path? Do you want to do this?"**

And if she says yes and is interested, **then we have something to work with.** We have the head of the Navy saying, "I want this for in-service support someday, and I feel that we should start testing now."

And when she says that — because that's what I'm expecting — then I think we have something to work with. And there'll be all kinds of other Navy officials with her, and they'll be **people that actually do the work** — she can say yes/no to all kinds of things and you need her to do that. But then you also need people to do the work.

And so I think they're gonna be there too, and then **I will get a new name** and she'll say, "Go see him," and him and I are going to start talking and I'm going to say, **"Look, I can put funding behind this if you want it, but you need to tell me that this is something we can do."**

**And right there is gonna be the real decision** of whether this turns into something that our company supports or whether it doesn't.

**Michael:** Would that be okay if I after that time send you an email to get some updates?

**Aaron:** Yeah, that's absolutely fine.

## Digital Inventory & IP Discussion

**Michael:** The idea that I found out — if we want to move to digital inventory, we are talking about the OEMs, and after that we are talking about the IPs. Obviously the OEMs don't like to share their IP. Have you faced this kind of conversation? Have you seen any solution to reach an OEM and say, "I have a platform for digital inventory — would you like to give me your IP? I promise to make it safe in the cloud."

**Aaron:** Yeah, so years back — this was going back quite a ways — **I worked with IBM and DeepSense through Dal.** I don't know if you know **DeepSense**?

**Michael:** ...

**Aaron:** But they do — they're working on data. **You should look them up — DeepSense at Dal.** And I can put you in touch with them too if you want. Their focus is **data analytics.** So it sounds somewhat potentially linked to the work you do.

And since you guys are both at Dal, you should probably talk. **We tried to come up with a system that would help us track all the inventory and do something related to preventative maintenance** — which means you're tracking everything, and you don't necessarily need to pay attention to when something's going to potentially fail, because the system tells you when to replace it.

And if something else goes wrong, there's a sensor on it to go, "Oh, this needs replacing sooner."

**So preventative maintenance is a massive thing in the US Navy**, and it's very difficult to keep track of because of all the data — **the data is massive.** And so we were trying to think of ways to accumulate that data based on our **ship repair program.** For example, how do we fix the Halifax class? And how do we create a preventative maintenance plan?

And really this is linked to **Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)** — which is really constantly trying to track: here's the manual for this thing, and this is the maintenance schedule, and these are all the things you need to do. Lots of information — **each component will have an ILS plan** with the thing you buy.

## L3 Harris & Data Challenges

**Aaron:** We were trying to figure out a way to do it here on our programs, and **we couldn't get there.** Because **Dal came back and said, "It's gonna take 3 years for us to figure this out."** And we were like, "That's too long. The business works faster than that."

And so really, I think **L3 Harris** — it was L3 at the time, big company — they work on all our ship programs.

**Michael:** By the way, L3 Harris — I've heard about that name.

**Aaron:** They have a big base in Quebec, in Montreal. So L3 Harris has a huge Canadian headquarters. Anyway, **I think they took the lead on that**, because there was a kind of data release from National Defence that anyone could use, and **L3 just took it and were way faster than we were.** So I think they've kind of done the lead on those things.

So they'd be worth talking to. But the real answer to your question is **there's tons of data out there**, and even on some of our older programs — **we've been taking care of the Halifax class forever. Some of it's not digital. Some of it's pen and paper, spreadsheets.**

So I think what you're doing — there's places to go. You just need to keep talking to the right people. And maybe **our ship repair people might be the best program for you** to look at, as opposed to AOPS. Like **Thales would be the lead on AOPS** taking care of that, **but we take care of the Halifax class**, and the data goes back 20 years.

So it's infinite — which probably makes that job very difficult. But **digitizing it — that's a great idea.** All the obstacles in the way of it, there's probably a lot of them. But I think that's where you're trying to figure out.

---

## AI & Machine Learning Discussion

**Michael:** Have you considered using new technologies — machine learning or AI — in any part of that?

**Aaron:** **We haven't.** The data is so large and a bit disjointed that we haven't really been able to go... **AI is only as good as the collection of the data.** And that part is just a little too unwieldy at the moment.

**It's clearly the future, and clearly what we're going to get to.** But at the moment we don't do it.

I ran up AI with our **ship repair division last week.** And they were like, **"Obviously the future. But the data just isn't good enough for us to plug it in."** And so he was like, "I can't use a new company to do that because it's not something we can just put on a tray and deliver."

---

## Modest Tree & Digital Transformation

**Michael:** So my final question is about your recent post — you recently shared about Modest Tree securing the $32M contract for maritime training solutions using VR and AR. How do you think these kinds of technologies alongside AI and machine learning are going to help with digital transformation?

**Aaron:** I'm not sure, because really this goes through our **Fleetway office.** So Fleetway is our marine engineering office, and they work on all our training. They work massively with the ship repair office — they're kind of linked.

So I think the best thing for me to do is probably **put you in touch with someone in ship repair and someone in Fleetway.**

---

## Closing & Follow-Up Commitments

**Michael:** Thank you very much for the time. I got so much great information and especially updates that are so important for me. If you could please introduce me to people that you think would be valuable — being introduced by someone from the industry is so much more beneficial than cold emails.

**Aaron:** No, that's fine. And you're right — it's gonna be hard for you. The only reason my interest in this is because **it's so timely that we're going to visit Dal.** And you're at Dal, and I can tell you're working on things in early phases that will probably help us someday. So there is certainly interest.

**I'll link you to our ship repair and Fleetway people.** I don't know exactly who yet — usually I know exactly who right now. But I know all those folks, so it won't be that hard.

**And then you and I can talk after my visit to Dal.** You really need to know what the Navy's thinking, and **I'll be able to share that with you when I'm done.**

**Michael:** Would that be okay if I reach out after that time for another meeting?

**Aaron:** **A week after the meeting**, because I have to discuss with the Admiral after her visit and get her sense. And then I'll kind of have a picture of: **yeah, the Navy's interested, these are the things we got.** Yeah perfect.

**Michael:** Thank you very much for all of the information. That was so so helpful for me.

**Aaron:** No problem. Good luck.
