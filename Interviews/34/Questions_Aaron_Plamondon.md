## Interview Context & Strategy

### Why Aaron Plamondon?
Aaron is a **UNIQUELY strategic interview** because he sits at the **exact intersection** of our three pillars:

| Pillar | Aaron's Role |
|---|---|
| **Additive Manufacturing** | Board Member, UNB Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence (MAMCE) — the national centre for marine AM led by Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi with Irving & JDI partnership |
| **Defence Procurement** | Director of ITB at Irving Shipbuilding — manages **multi-billion dollar** industrial benefits obligations; PhD literally in defence procurement |
| **Ocean Innovation Ecosystem** | Board Member at COVE — the Centre for Ocean Ventures and Entrepreneurship |

### Connection to Lee Vessey & Thales
- **Lee Vessey** (Thales) is the connection who suggested this meeting
- We've already had a **meeting with Thales and Lee Vessey** — reference this to establish credibility
- Thales is a **major combat systems integrator** on the Canadian Surface Combatant program — direct relevance to naval spare parts
- The Thales connection + Irving ITB = two of the biggest defence primes aligned on our value proposition

### Strategic Alignment with Previous Interviews
- ✅ **Tyler Beatty's "Permission" pillar**: Aaron IS the permission authority — ITB policy creates mandatory pathways for startups
- ✅ **Shawn Sooley's "Aerospace First"**: Defence (naval) certification may be a parallel pathway to aerospace
- ✅ **Mentor Panel (Sheila Patterson)**: ITB policy was specifically mentioned as a defence entry strategy
- ✅ **Carol's Stakeholder Map**: Aaron is simultaneously an **economic buyer** (ITB funds), **influencer** (COVE/MAMCE boards), and potential **champion**
- ✅ **Mike Paulin's Arctic/Navy angle**: Canadian navy Arctic operations = AM opportunity

### What Makes This Unique
Aaron is one of few people who can speak to:
1. **How the ITB obligation works** — and whether AddManuChain could be a beneficiary
2. **What MAMCE is doing** in marine AM — are they printing naval parts?
3. **The gap between MAMCE's research and commercialization** — where AddManuChain fits
4. **Defence procurement cycles** — how long, who decides, what evidence is needed
5. **COVE's perspective** on ocean tech startups — what succeeds and what doesn't

## OPENING — Lee Vessey & Thales Connection

**"Aaron, thank you for making time. Lee Vessey over at Thales suggested I reach out to you — I had a really productive meeting with Lee and the Thales team about our work in digital inventory and on-demand additive manufacturing for maritime and defence spare parts. Lee felt that given your position at the intersection of defence procurement, AM through the MAMCE board, and the ocean innovation ecosystem at COVE — you'd be the ideal person to continue that conversation. How do you and Lee know each other, and did he share any context about what we discussed?"**

> **Purpose:** Establish credibility through the Thales meeting and Lee's referral. Signals that a major defence prime has already engaged with you. Let Aaron share what he already knows so you can calibrate.

## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: The ITB Obligation — How Can Startups Benefit? 💰
**"As Director of Industrial & Technological Benefits at Irving Shipbuilding, you manage what I understand is a multi-billion dollar obligation to reinvest into Canadian companies. For a startup like ours — focused on digital inventory and on-demand additive manufacturing for maritime and defence spare parts — how does the ITB process work? In our meeting with Lee Vessey and the Thales team, we got a sense of the demand side — they see the spare parts challenge firsthand as a combat systems integrator. From the ITB side at Irving, is there a pathway for us to become a beneficiary, and what would we need to demonstrate?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Sheila Patterson (mentor panel)** specifically cited ITB policy as the way into defence
- Tyler Beatty's "Permission" framework → ITB could be the **permission mechanism**
- This is potentially a **funded customer acquisition channel** rather than just a sale

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Clear pathway**: "Yes, we actively look for Canadian companies that can fulfill ITB obligations in advanced manufacturing"
- ✅ **Specific criteria**: "You'd need to demonstrate Canadian content, IP ownership, and operational capability"
- ✅ **Scale of opportunity**: Dollar figures or percentage of total ITB going to small companies
- ✅ **Process steps**: How to register, who evaluates proposals, timeline
- ❌ **Red flag**: "ITB mostly goes to established primes and large subs" (startup exclusion)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What percentage of ITB flows to small/medium enterprises vs. large defence primes?"
- "Is there a registry or application process? How does a startup get on the radar?"
- "Have you funded additive manufacturing companies through ITB before?"
- "What's the typical dollar value and duration of an ITB-funded engagement?"
- "Does ITB cover R&D, or is it primarily for production/service delivery?"
- "In our meeting with Thales, they acknowledged the spare parts lifecycle challenge — do Irving and Thales coordinate on ITB obligations for through-life support, or are they separate streams?"
- "Could a single solution like ours serve both Irving and Thales under their respective ITB commitments?"

### Q2: UNB Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre (MAMCE) — What's the State of Play? 🔬
**"You sit on the board of the UNB Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence — which is led by Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi and involves Irving, JDI, and the community colleges. From your board perspective, where is MAMCE right now in terms of technology readiness? Are they actually printing parts that go onto ships? And where do you see the gap between their research capability and real-world deployment on naval vessels?"**

#### Why This Matters
- MAMCE is **the** Canadian centre for marine AM — we need to know if they're friend or competitor
- Tyler Beatty mentioned ExxonMobil's $17.5M into Memorial's SMART Lab — MAMCE is the UNB equivalent
- Understanding the R&D-to-deployment gap reveals where AddManuChain's **digital inventory platform** creates value

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Research-production gap**: "We can print great parts in the lab, but getting them certified and onto ships is the real challenge"
- ✅ **Certification bottleneck**: "Class societies (Lloyd's, DNV) haven't figured out how to certify AM marine parts at scale"
- ✅ **Platform opportunity**: "What's missing is the digital infrastructure — knowing WHICH parts to print, WHEN, and WHERE"
- ✅ **Collaboration interest**: "We'd love to partner with someone doing the digital/logistics side"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We've solved the full pipeline from design to deployment" (no opportunity)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What types of parts is MAMCE currently printing — structural, non-critical, or both?"
- "How close is MAMCE to getting class society approval for marine AM parts?"
- "Is Irving actually using AM-printed parts on the Canadian Surface Combatant or Arctic patrol vessels?"
- "Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi — would it make sense for us to connect with him?"
- "What materials does MAMCE work with — metals, polymers, both?"

### Q3: Canadian Surface Combatant & AOPS — Spare Parts Challenges 🚢
**"Irving is building the Arctic and Offshore Patrol Ships and other related projects — these are multi-decade programs. From your vantage point, what does the spare parts supply chain look like for these vessels over a 30-year lifecycle? Are there already concerns about parts obsolescence, long lead times, or OEM dependencies — and could on-demand manufacturing be part of the solution?"**

#### Why This Matters
- AOPS & CSC are **$80+ billion programs** over decades — spare parts are a massive lifecycle cost
- Tyler Beatty's "War on Inventory" concept applies to naval vessels
- Defence ships face the **same obsolescence problem** as offshore platforms — but with added classification requirements

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Lifecycle concern**: "Over 30 years, many original parts will become obsolete — OEMs go out of business"
- ✅ **Cost driver**: "Through-life support is where the real money is — the build is just the beginning"
- ✅ **AM receptivity**: "The Royal Canadian Navy is interested in onboard manufacturing capability"
- ✅ **Specific examples**: Types of parts that are already problematic (valves, brackets, seals, legacy electronics)
- ❌ **Red flag**: "The Navy has a well-established supply chain with no gaps" (no opportunity)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's the estimated through-life support cost for the CSC program?"
- "Has the Navy explored onboard 3D printing for at-sea repairs?"
- "Are there specific OEM lock-in situations that create pain?"
- "How does the Navy currently handle obsolete parts — redesign? Stockpile? Cannibalize?"
- "Could a digital twin / digital inventory platform help the Navy manage spare parts across the fleet?"

### Q4: COVE & the Ocean Innovation Ecosystem 🌊
**"As a COVE board member, you've seen dozens of ocean tech startups. From your experience — what separates the startups that succeed from those that fail? And specifically, for a company like ours that sits at the intersection of digital technology and physical manufacturing for the marine sector — what advice would you give us on how to position ourselves and where to focus?"**

#### Why This Matters
- David Thomas (The Pier) talked about **demand-led innovation** — COVE likely has similar philosophy
- Aaron can give candid advice about what works in the Halifax ocean tech ecosystem
- Understanding his perspective helps us **position AddManuChain** correctly for the defence/ocean sector

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Customer validation**: "The ones that succeed have a clear customer before they build"
- ✅ **Defence positioning**: "If you can show a defence application with ITB eligibility, doors open"
- ✅ **Ecosystem advice**: "You should be talking to [specific person/program] at COVE"
- ✅ **Dual-use advantage**: "Companies with both civilian and defence applications get the most traction"
- ✅ **Funding guidance**: "There are specific programs — IRAP, ISED, DND IDEaS — you should apply to"

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Are there COVE programs for companies at our stage?"
- "Who at COVE should I be talking to about defence applications?"
- "Have you seen companies successfully bridge the ocean tech → defence transition?"
- "What's the biggest mistake ocean tech startups make when approaching defence?"
- "Is COVE connected to the DND Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) program?"

### Q5: Certification & Class Society — The "Permission" Problem 🔐
**"From talking with people like Shawn Sooley and Tyler Beatty, we've learned that the #1 barrier to AM adoption isn't the technology — it's certification. Class societies like Lloyd's and DNV haven't kept pace with AM. From your unique perspective — sitting on both the MAMCE board AND running ITB at Irving — do you see a pathway to getting AM parts certified for naval and marine use? And could the defence procurement process actually ACCELERATE certification, since the government has more leverage than individual companies?"**

#### Why This Matters
- Every interview validates certification as THE barrier (Tyler's "Permission" pillar)
- Defence/government procurement may have **leverage to force class society movement**
- Shawn Sooley's "Aerospace First" strategy might have a **"Naval First" parallel**
- Aaron can speak to both the demand side (Irving/Navy) and the supply side (MAMCE)

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Government leverage**: "If DND specs AM parts, class societies will have to develop standards"
- ✅ **Naval parallel to aerospace**: "The military has different risk tolerance and certification pathways"
- ✅ **Standards development**: "There are ongoing efforts — NATO, allied navies — to standardize AM qualification"
- ✅ **Specific pathway**: "Start with non-critical parts under military specs, then migrate to class society approval"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "The Navy won't accept any risk on AM parts" (no defence pathway)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Are NATO allies (US, UK, Australia) further ahead on naval AM certification?"
- "Could military qualification be used as evidence for civilian class society approval?"
- "Is there a specific standard emerging for marine AM parts (AWS, ASTM, ISO)?"
- "Would Irving support a pilot project — printing and qualifying a non-critical part for AOPS?"
- "Has MAMCE published any qualification data that could support certification?"

## BONUS QUESTIONS (2)

### BONUS Q1: The IP & Digital Rights Question 🛡️
**"One concern we hear is that OEMs don't want their designs digitized because of IP theft risk. We're developing a secure approach using encrypted digital rights management — essentially a 'black box' that protects the OEM's IP while enabling on-demand printing. From Irving's perspective as both a shipbuilder and an OEM — would this kind of approach make you more comfortable with digital inventory?"**

#### Why This Matters
- The Raspberry Pi "black box" concept needs validation from an OEM perspective
- Irving IS an OEM — they can speak to the IP concern directly
- Shelley Hesshen (mentor panel) emphasized IP protection — this tests our approach

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **IP concern validated**: "Yes, OEM IP protection is a critical barrier"
- ✅ **Approach interest**: "A secure digital rights management system would help"
- ✅ **Irving's perspective**: "If we could control who prints what and when, we'd consider it"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "No digital rights system is secure enough" (fundamental barrier)

### BONUS Q2: Aaron's Recent Post — Modest Tree & Maritime Training 📱
**"I noticed you recently shared a post about Modest Tree securing a $32M contract for maritime training solutions. That's really impressive. Are there parallels between what they're doing with VR/AR training and what we could do with digital inventory — both being digital transformation plays in the maritime sector? And from an ITB perspective, is there a template in Modest Tree's success that we could follow?"**

#### Why This Matters
- Shows you did your homework on his LinkedIn activity
- Modest Tree is a Halifax success story in maritime digital transformation — $32M contract is a model
- Demonstrates that ITB CAN fund digital/tech companies, not just hardware

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What made Modest Tree successful from an ITB perspective?"
- "Are there other digital transformation companies benefiting from naval ITB?"
- "Could digital inventory be positioned similarly to VR training — as a lifecycle support capability?"
