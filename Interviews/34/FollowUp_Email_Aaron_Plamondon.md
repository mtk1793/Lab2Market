**Subject:** Following Up: AddManuChain & Your Dalhousie Visit (Feb 18)

**Body:**

Hi Aaron,

I hope you’ve been having a great month since we last spoke. Thank you again for the incredibly insightful conversation on February 13th regarding the ITB process, the Navy's stance on additive manufacturing, and the specific data challenges surrounding the Halifax-class ships. 

During our call, you mentioned that on February 18th you were visiting the additive manufacturing facilities at Dalhousie University alongside the Fleet Admiral to gauge the Navy's appetite for moving forward with AM adoption. 

As we are currently refining AddManuChain’s business case to focus squarely on solving real operational data / lead-time problems (rather than just pushing the technology), I am very eager to hear how that visit went. Did the Admiral see a viable path forward for certified AM parts in the fleet? 

If the Navy gave the green light, we would love to explore how AddManuChain's digital inventory and analytics platform could sit on top of the Dalhousie testing/production efforts to help Irving and the Navy manage this transition effectively (and potentially satisfy ITB obligations). 

Additionally, if the offer still stands, I would be incredibly grateful for the promised introductions to the Irving Ship Repair team (regarding Halifax-class maintenance data) and the DeepSense analytics team at Dalhousie. 

Do you have 15 minutes to reconnect sometime this week or next to discuss the outcomes of the Feb 18th visit?

Best regards,
