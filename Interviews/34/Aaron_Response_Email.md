**Subject:** RE: Thank you for spreading the word

Hi Aaron,

Thank you so much for getting back to me — and I completely understand that the schedule is tight on the 18th. No worries at all on that front. What's much more valuable is that you're circulating my info to your other divisions. That's incredibly generous, and I really appreciate you opening those doors.

I'm really excited about the work happening at Irving with AM, and I think circulating the information to ship repair and Fleetway contacts will lead to some great conversations. I've been learning a lot from the interviews I've done across the ecosystem, and the pattern is becoming clearer — AM is a game-changer for supply chain resilience, but the certification and integration piece is what's been holding it back.

I hope Dalhousie's AM capabilities impress during your visit on the 18th, and I'm optimistic about what this could mean for the Navy's direction on additive manufacturing.

I also noticed that COVE is hosting an "Ocean Connector" event on **February 26 from 4:00-6:00 pm** — bringing together Ultra Maritime, Hawboldt Industries, DRDC, and other marine tech leaders to discuss moving innovations from concept to operational deployment. It sounds like exactly the kind of conversation that's relevant to what we're building. Would be great to see you there if you're able to make it!

Thanks again for your support and for opening doors with other divisions. I'll reach out around February 25th as you suggested, and I'm looking forward to where this all goes.

Best regards,
