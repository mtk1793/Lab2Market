## Introduction

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** So as I just talked a little bit about in the email itself. First, let me just introduce myself. My name is Mahmoud Kiasari. I'm doing my PhD at Dalhousie University Canada right now. And around a couple of years ago I had a project with a company — that company was working in 3D printing. So we had an idea about developing some kind of aspect of digital inventory and using additive manufacturing, then recently I got accepted in the program named Lab2Market from Memorial University that is trying to encourage us as young entrepreneurs in order to validate their idea to see that it is going to work or not. So throughout this program, I have to talk with at least 100 people. And every time I have to talk with you guys to gain more knowledge about experience about my idea based on the questions that I'm going to ask you. So would that be okay for you if you just introduce yourself a little bit? I mean I know everything from your LinkedIn, but if I just heard from you better.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Of course. Yeah, so **I'm Research and Development Advisor with ExxonMobil. I've been with ExxonMobil for 18 years.** Many, many different jobs. I'm trained as a geoscientist, academically, and have had many roles across production, development, exploration, management, portfolio management, and now I'm doing research and development.

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** So the procedure is like this. Every time I do have a couple of questions, just 4 or 5 questions is made up. And I'm going to ask you about that. So at the end of these questions, I'm going to talk more about my idea. The reason I'm not doing that is there are 2 reasons — the very first one is that again the idea is broad. I'm still trying to do the researching phase to see how it's going to be applicable for the market. And the second one is that every time I talk about my idea and the people like you are so nice when you hear about that and say, okay, let's give this guy a little bit compliment. So I really don't want that. I want true and honest answers for each of those questions. Because you're going to shift my pitch and my marketing.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** And don't worry, I'll be direct with you. That's my personality.

## Question 1: Spare Parts Challenges

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** So the first question would be about spare parts challenges. Actually, this is an important thing that I'm working on. So as you just mentioned, you work as a geologist a couple of years, and you were working at the Hibernia, right? Am I pronouncing it right or Hebron?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Yeah, **I've been a manager of technical teams for both Hibernia and Hebron assets.**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** So during your time there, what were the biggest challenges related to spare parts availability? If it was availability, equipment failure, or maintenance logistics?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** So real quick, most of my experience is subsurface, not surface, so your relevancy will be — you'll have to kind of tune it. My answers will be tuned to that experience. But in my various roles, typically, **the challenges came on needing to change, say, part of the well completion design. Or the well trajectory changed the pressure rating requirements of your casing, and those two things are really, really long lead items** typically. And have you heard the term "long lead" before?

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Yeah, I'm working on that.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** So **those long lead items tended to be what were some of the major constraints on our ability to either achieve the ideal well or to mitigate if there was an issue.** Other places that parts may or may not come into play — and again, this would be my awareness would be around the processing stream, so both water handling and oil processing, all of which, if you think about it, are part of the general workflow on the platform. And so **anything that's in that critical path, if you have an equipment failure while you're in production, it typically meant downtime.**

The other challenge for spare parts, because you use that word, was **the cost of maintaining redundancy in your inventory was typically a line item that would get challenged on annual budget.**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Yeah, I heard about that.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** That makes sense — **the "War on Inventory."** No, I'm not kidding. That's a term that I use — **"War on Inventory."** So it's really the challenge between the cost of having the spare parts on hand vs. **hot-shotting** them to the situation. And "hot shot" — have you heard of that before?

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** First time, no.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Okay, so that's terminology that's used in the oil and gas industry in the field. And what that means is **a super intense, high-cost courier job.** Yeah, so you've probably heard examples already of needing to charter an aircraft for a doorknob. I'm just making it up, but you know what I mean.

So it's that **"War on Inventory"** — because you can see the tangible cost if you have redundancy, and you tend to accept the cost when there's intensity and urgency and dollars lost for non-productive time. Yeah, so there's the balance.

## Discussion: Solutions to Spare Parts Cost

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Okay perfect. I get it. Before reaching out to the next question — actually, because I also talked with a couple of more companies, and they also mentioned the same thing about keeping their spare parts in the warehouse, maintaining it. I mean, the human capital, everything that costs a lot. I heard numbers around millions — 2 to maybe 4 or 5 millions from different industries. Depends on the scale. But have you had any kind of solution? Have you thought of any solutions to maybe reduce the cost or is it just "that's the way it is, can't do anything about it"?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Well, I mean, our organization is continually trying to optimize on all aspects of its value chain, right? So you would have a **buyer's department and contracts department** that would be continually looking from, I'll call it, a contract nuance relative to what's been going on in the market to see if we can **reduce costs through either bulk buys** — if we had confidence that we were doing repeat jobs — or through **longer term contracts** that would come with better terms. Again, typically that would be through the business transaction space that you'd be trying to mitigate those costs, **not through any particular technology.**

## Question 2: Innovation Evaluation & TRL

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** So about the innovation evaluation process. As a research, education and training lead for Canada R&D — you evaluate new technologies obviously. Can you walk me through how ExxonMobil decides whether to pilot or adopt new technology?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** I mean, this is — that's a pretty complex question. Because if you could imagine there are so many departments and divisions that have a technology ambition with respect to new technologies. So, let's get a little bit more specific to parts and offshore world, just so that we can narrow down.

So **personnel onboard in the offshore is one of the main metrics in terms of value driver, and we're always trying to reduce the amount of people that need to be in the offshore environment** in a risky environment. And so most of our technology is oriented towards either **better sensors, remote operations, automation, and techniques that provide a reduction in personnel onboard.**

But like you said, how do you decide on piloting vs. executing — I would think that's kind of what you're doing. And so oftentimes my approach is to try to consider **what are the foundational or critical capabilities that are required to be de-risked.** And if we can de-risk them in an environment that's **analogous to the offshore**, and then we can rapidly take that to the next step. So that's getting from your **TRL 8 to TRL 9** to jump right there.

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** So the TRL 8 or 9, so it is going to be for the pilot, right? The pilot projects.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Yeah, just so that's exactly what you do. Is you take it and say, okay, well, **you may be trying to sell this to be commercial right now. We don't have a management of change order** to go and change what's going on on the platform right now. But **we could establish the value proposition by doing a pilot in this other environment that would be analogous to.** And therefore we can move towards a management of change.

## Question 3: Additive Manufacturing Position & FieldNode

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** What is the position of additive manufacturing in your work? When you're talking about the spare parts and digital inventory — does it have any place there?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** So I have — who's told you about FieldNode yet? Has anyone told —

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Yeah, I know about it.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Okay good. So like **we're a member of FieldNode, we see it as regrettable to not be watching the market right now with respect to additive manufacturing.** So we monitor progression there.

And I mean, you can use this all day long if you want — I use this all the time for evaluating opportunities. So it's a **Venn diagram: there's Value, there's Capability, and then there's Permission.** And Permission typically comes in what I would call a certification or regulatory environment or policy, right?

And so, you're going to be on value proposition all day long. **If I can eliminate your supply chain issues, that's a value proposition, right?** Okay. Is the capability there? **Can you actually print a part that will do the job required?** Okay. So both of those things are fairly well understood now — we can print parts, and we know that if I eliminate that aspect of the supply chain — which is the raw material being shipped to Newfoundland to be value-added — the excess waste shipped out of Newfoundland — **you basically have a high carbon emissions footprint and a high cost.** So you turn that around and say, well, I'd love to do that.

**And then your certifying authorities come right in and say, "well, no, I haven't certified that part."** Okay, so now you have a battle between OEMs and your on-demand printing situation. So is it the job of the oil and gas industry to go and solve that problem between OEMs and people that want to have on-demand printing? Well, it appears to be that that's what it's going to kick to, right?

And so **I actually think that this is a real big stifling of innovation here in that the certifying authorities haven't led the charge towards 3D printing and additive manufacturing application in the offshore.**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Okay, that makes sense.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** **Very passionate about this topic.** By the way.

## ExxonMobil's $17.5M Investment at Memorial University

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** I'm also aware of — well, you know, the relationship of Memorial and additive manufacturing. Can I ask you about that?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Yeah, we did that investment. But I'm talking about the **SMART Lab. Dr. Ahmed Arubi. We have established — well, the cost to me was $17.5 million dollars.** It's a **full additive manufacturing laboratory setup from full supply chain — from materials to certification and testing — all for metals, multiple metals printers.**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Interesting, I didn't —

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** **I guess that should probably tell you the level of commitment.**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Yeah, that is fantastic.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** **I'm taking those researchers to the CanMap Materials Lab in Ontario in March** to develop even more collaborations with my materials and advanced manufacturing advisors from our **Central Technology Organization**, really.

## iNOVi — New Brunswick AM Support Program

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Write this down — **iNOVi**, I think is who it is. They're at University of New Brunswick. I guess it's some kind of an adjacent, separate institutional entity or something like that. Anyway, I was just on the **Atlantic Region AI Roundtable**, so they were just telling me about — they have an **additive manufacturing support program** for **small and medium enterprises.**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Fantastic, thank you.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** So you might find them kind of interesting to talk to.

## Michael's Idea Pitch & Feedback

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** So let me just give you my idea right now. The idea that we had at the beginning was about building an ecosystem, the ecosystem between different entities like the OEMs, 3D printing facilities, the authorities and regulations, and so on and so forth. The idea is a little bit big and ambitious to be honest right now. But after that, we tried to shift our focus on encouraging industries to focus on on-site 3D printing facilities. So obviously when we are talking about that, we are talking about another concept — digital inventory. So when you're talking about digital inventory, we're talking about dealing with OEMs, dealing with regulations, dealing with all those certifications, etc. Recently, I was also introduced to using machine learning. I mean, the last time I said AI and one guy didn't like it. He said, "AI is not new. We've been using it since 2016. It was machine learning back then but right now it's a buzzword AI." But yeah, using machine learning or AI in order to help industries not only in their inventory but also something we call as predictive maintenance or any other kind of aspect that they can use this machine learning or technology. So as an expert, what's your idea toward this matter?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** To be more clear — like **machine learning for insights into your inventory analysis or machine learning for insights in the design phase?**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Actually, mostly in using it in the inventory itself in the digital inventory, just managing everything, and also another part about the quality control and quality assurance by using different kinds of sensors and data.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** So you're kind of getting into like it's — it's kind of **generative design space** a little bit, but more — I think you're more just looking at — can I simulate the part in... a **digital twin** space.

I'm going to say, I think **machine learning's got a few applications here.** Obviously, as humans, we're kind of busy putting tags and codes and numbers and names on things. So I think one of your approaches might be to kind of **illuminate more than just the top line part, but also all of the metadata that comes with that part** that might actually inform the spare part replacement approach. Because in the end, **am I replacing with exactly the OEM or am I replacing with the functional elements that are required for that spare part?**

## Discussion: Digital Inventory Concept

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** What about the concept of digital inventory? Rather than focusing on additive manufacturing itself, what is your idea about digital inventory?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Well, I personally think it's sort of a **natural table stakes in reality**, because why wouldn't we have more and more robust — I'll call it **digital twinning from a parts representation space**, right? Like even if you go back to, I don't know if you're into mechanical stuff at all, but you go to your owner's manual for a small engine. It'll have very detailed blueprint-style design or pictures of every single piece, right? Why did that have to be printed from its kind of vector representation from its CAD model vs. **just being represented as a digital element to begin with?** Because then I can take my parts and **actually fit them together in simulation space.**

## Referrals & Contacts

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** At the end of each conversation, I have two favors. The first one is obviously I have to talk with at least 100 people and reaching out to them through myself is less effective compared to reaching out to the person through you guys. So if you have someone in your network that maybe can give me another perspective. The finance guys or other guys. I would be more than happy.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** **My network's huge, man. It's absolutely huge.** So what do you want?

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** To be honest —

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** You want someone from another operator? And you talk to **Brad Elliott** yet?

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Brad Elliott — there's so many people that mentioned his name but no, not yet.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Well, because **he's the person at Equinor that's kind of representing that.** If you really want to talk to the super-duper person at Equinor, the global lead in additive manufacturing — **Greda Aleirum** is who you should talk to.

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Okay, would that be okay?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** She runs, I mean, you'd find him on LinkedIn in a second. You must know who he is. **He's one of the main — he's the global lead at Equinor, and Equinor is probably one of the leaders.** The other — have you talked to **Ladna (or Lachna) at Aker?**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** I'm not sure, no I didn't talk with her.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Aker Solutions or Aker — I'm gonna have to go and I just need **you to send me an email as a request.** Basically, so this follow up will be "request for additive manufacturing experts in your network." Yeah, so **I can introduce you to:**
- **Brad Elliott at Equinor** (or Greda Aleirum — global AM lead, Tyler recommends Greda)
- **Ladna/Lachna at Aker Solutions** — she's the additive manufacturing lead
- **Dr. Ahmed Arubi at Memorial** — SMART Lab, metals AM research (ExxonMobil's $17.5M investment)
- **Dr. Sima Alecto at Memorial** — material science and cold spray perspective

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Dr. Nasiri — he used to be at Memorial, but right now he's at Dalhousie.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** He's kind of Ahmed's one of his mentors and collaborators. So the other person you could talk to at MUN would be **Dr. Sima Alecto**, and she comes at it from a material science and cold spray. So you're going to get a different perspective. Maybe a little bit more cold eyes on the digital inventory aspect.

## Closing — Open Door

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** One last question — in the future, can I just shoot you an email, say that "hey, I found out these topics, I think they're interesting," are you willing to have another conversation?

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** **Sure, even keep in touch.**

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** Thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it. Have a great day.

**Speaker 1 (Tyler):** Okay, take care, buddy.
