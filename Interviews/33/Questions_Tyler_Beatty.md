## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: Hibernia Field Spare Parts Challenges 🛢️
**"You worked as a Production Geologist on the Hibernia Field from 2010 to 2013. Hibernia was built in the 1990s, so it's now a mature platform. During your time there, what were the biggest challenges related to spare parts availability, equipment failures, or maintenance logistics? Can you share a specific example where a component failure created operational headaches?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates mature platform hypothesis**: Andrew Smith mentioned Hibernia—does Tyler confirm the pain?
- **Quantifies downtime costs**: Production geologists know the cost of equipment failures
- **Tests obsolescence hypothesis**: Are 1990s-era parts hard to source?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Spare parts pain**: "We constantly struggled with obsolete parts that took months to source"
- ✅ **Downtime costs**: "A single equipment failure could cost $100K+ per day in lost production"
- ✅ **Inventory burden**: "Hibernia keeps massive spare parts inventory because resupply is so difficult"
- ✅ **Emergency procurement**: "We had to charter helicopters for emergency parts deliveries"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Spare parts weren't really a problem at Hibernia" (invalidates hypothesis)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What specific components failed most often? Pumps? Valves? Structural parts?"
- "How long did it typically take to get a replacement part to Hibernia?"
- "Did you ever have to cannibalize parts from one system to keep another running?"
- "What was the most expensive emergency parts delivery you witnessed?"
- "If you could have manufactured parts on-demand in St. John's, how much would that have saved?"

### Q2: ExxonMobil's Innovation Evaluation Process 🔬
**"As the Research, Education and Training Lead for Canada East R&D, you evaluate new technologies for ExxonMobil. Can you walk me through how ExxonMobil decides whether to pilot or adopt a new technology? What criteria do you use—ROI, risk, strategic fit? And what does the approval process look like?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Identifies decision criteria**: What does ExxonMobil need to see to pilot AM?
- **Tests budget authority**: Can Tyler greenlight a pilot, or does it need corporate approval?
- **Validates business case requirements**: What ROI threshold is required?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Clear criteria**: "We evaluate ROI, technical feasibility, safety, and regulatory compliance"
- ✅ **Pilot pathway**: "We typically start with a small pilot project before scaling"
- ✅ **Budget authority**: "I can approve pilots up to $X; larger projects need corporate approval"
- ✅ **Strategic fit**: "Technologies that reduce costs or improve safety get priority"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "ExxonMobil is very conservative and rarely adopts new technologies"

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What ROI does ExxonMobil typically require for new technologies? 2x? 5x?"
- "How long does the evaluation process take from initial pitch to pilot approval?"
- "Who are the key decision-makers we'd need to convince (operations, procurement, finance)?"
- "Have you piloted any additive manufacturing technologies at ExxonMobil before?"
- "What would a successful pilot project look like for AM spare parts?"

### Q3: Business Case Requirements & Working Capital 💰
**"You spent several years in business development and portfolio strategy roles in Texas. From that experience, what would a compelling business case for additive manufacturing spare parts need to include? And specifically, would ExxonMobil's CFO care more about reducing inventory carrying costs (working capital) or reducing downtime costs?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates Kwadwo's working capital hypothesis**: Is this the #1 ROI driver for CFOs?
- **Tests value proposition**: Should we lead with cost savings or downtime reduction?
- **Identifies financial metrics**: What numbers do we need to prove?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Working capital focus**: "CFOs definitely care about reducing inventory carrying costs"
- ✅ **Downtime costs**: "But downtime costs are even more important—$100K+ per day"
- ✅ **Quantitative requirements**: "You'd need to show at least $5M in annual savings to get attention"
- ✅ **Risk mitigation**: "Reducing supply chain risk is also a strategic priority"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Cost savings aren't a big priority for ExxonMobil" (no business case)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's the typical inventory value for an offshore platform like Hibernia?"
- "How much does ExxonMobil spend annually on emergency/expedited parts delivery?"
- "Would a 20-30% reduction in spare parts inventory be meaningful to the CFO?"
- "What's more important: upfront cost savings or long-term strategic resilience?"
- "If we could prove $10M in annual savings across ExxonMobil's Atlantic Canada operations, would that get traction?"

### Q4: Memorial University CAIR Collaboration 🎓
**"I see you're involved with Memorial University's Center for Analytics, Informatics, and Research (CAIR). Could CAIR help validate additive manufacturing for offshore applications—for example, material testing, certification support, or graduate student research projects? And would ExxonMobil be interested in co-funding an R&D collaboration?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Explores academic partnership**: Can Memorial validate AM for offshore use?
- **Tests R&D funding**: Would ExxonMobil co-fund research with NSERC/MITACS?
- **Validates technical feasibility**: Can CAIR provide certification data?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **CAIR can help**: "Yes, CAIR has excellent facilities for materials testing and data analytics"
- ✅ **ExxonMobil interest**: "We'd be open to co-funding research if there's a clear business case"
- ✅ **Graduate student projects**: "This would make a great MASc or PhD thesis topic"
- ✅ **Certification pathway**: "CAIR could help generate the data needed for C-NLOPB approval"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "CAIR isn't set up for this type of research" (no academic pathway)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which Memorial professors are working on materials science or offshore engineering?"
- "Could we access Memorial's testing facilities (fatigue testing, environmental chambers)?"
- "What would a pilot R&D project look like? Timeline? Budget?"
- "Are there existing industry-academic partnerships we could join (C-CORE, ERINL)?"
- "Could Memorial students help with CAD library development or material qualification?"

### Q5: Internal Champion & Next Steps 🎯
**"If we were to develop a pilot project proposal for additive manufacturing spare parts at ExxonMobil—say, starting with non-critical components at Hibernia or another Atlantic Canada platform—would you be willing to champion this internally? And who else at ExxonMobil should we be talking to—operations, procurement, maintenance?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Tests champion potential**: Will Tyler advocate for AM within ExxonMobil?
- **Identifies decision-makers**: Who has budget and authority?
- **Validates next steps**: What's the pathway to a pilot project?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Willing to champion**: "If the business case is strong, I'd be happy to advocate internally"
- ✅ **Identifies stakeholders**: "You need to talk to [operations manager], [procurement lead], and [maintenance supervisor]"
- ✅ **Clear next steps**: "Send me a one-page proposal, and I'll circulate it internally"
- ✅ **Pilot interest**: "Let's start with non-critical components and prove the concept"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "I can't champion this" or "There's no pathway forward"

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What would a one-page pilot proposal need to include?"
- "Who at ExxonMobil has final approval authority for new technology pilots?"
- "What's the typical timeline from proposal to pilot approval?"
- "Would you prefer to start at Hibernia, or another Atlantic Canada platform?"
- "Are there any upcoming maintenance shutdowns where we could pilot AM parts?"
