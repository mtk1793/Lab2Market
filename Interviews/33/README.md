3. **Business case requirements**: What ROI does ExxonMobil need to see for new technologies?
4. **Memorial CAIR collaboration**: Could CAIR partner on AM research?
5. **Talent development**: Does ExxonMobil need training on AM technologies?

## Interview Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Validate Hibernia spare parts pain**: Confirm that mature platforms struggle with obsolescence
2. **Understand ExxonMobil's innovation process**: How do we get AM evaluated and adopted?
3. **Explore R&D partnership**: Could ExxonMobil fund a pilot project?
4. **Test Memorial CAIR collaboration**: Can Tyler connect us to university researchers?
5. **Identify champion**: Could Tyler be an internal advocate for AM at ExxonMobil?

### Bonus Insights

## Connection to Week 6 Insights

### Aligns With:

- ✅ **Keith's ERINL funding**: Tyler may know about R&D funding programs
- ✅ **Kwadwo's working capital**: ExxonMobil CFOs care about inventory costs
- ✅ **Academic collaboration**: Tyler bridges industry and Memorial University

- 🆕 **Memorial CAIR partnership**: Academic R&D collaboration
- 🆕 **Global ExxonMobil rollout**: If successful in Atlantic Canada, expand globally

## Interview Strategy

### Approach
- **Emphasize R&D and innovation**: "How does ExxonMobil evaluate new technologies?"
- **Focus on Hibernia pain points**: "What were the biggest spare parts challenges you saw?"
- **Explore business case**: "What ROI would ExxonMobil need to see to pilot AM?"
- **Test Memorial CAIR collaboration**: "Could CAIR help validate AM for offshore use?"

### Avoid
- ❌ Asking for proprietary ExxonMobil data (procurement costs, inventory levels)
- ❌ Over-promising on technology (he's a geologist, not an engineer—he'll be skeptical)
- ❌ Assuming he can make decisions (he's R&D lead, not procurement or operations)

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case
- Tyler validates **strong spare parts pain** at Hibernia and other mature platforms
- He sees **strategic value** in AM for ExxonMobil's offshore operations
- He offers to **champion AM internally** and connect us to procurement/operations
- He's **interested in R&D collaboration** through Memorial CAIR
- He provides **specific business case requirements** (ROI, timeline, certification)

### Worst Case
- Tyler sees **no spare parts pain** at Hibernia (invalidates hypothesis)
- He's **skeptical about AM** for offshore applications
- He has **no budget or authority** to pursue new technologies
- He's **not interested in collaboration** (too busy, wrong focus area)

### Most Likely
- Tyler acknowledges **some spare parts challenges** at Hibernia
- He's **cautiously interested** in AM but needs proof of certification and ROI
- He provides **valuable insights** on ExxonMobil's innovation process
- He's **open to Memorial CAIR collaboration** for research validation
- He suggests **starting with non-critical components** before moving to critical parts
