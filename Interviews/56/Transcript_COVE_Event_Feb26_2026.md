## Full Transcript (unedited)

**Speaker 1 (Michelle)**
We're here today with this group… [opening remarks, territorial acknowledgement, housekeeping, intern program pitch].

**Speaker 1 (Michelle)**
Introducing the panel: moderator Andrew Davies, then Brian (DRDC), Adam Gray (Ultra), Colin Gillis (Hobbal).

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Opening context: project manager at COVE, 15 years navy combat systems engineer. Today’s topic is underwater sensing and towed arrays. We want to talk less hardware, more about speed/scale of testing defence innovation. Trials compete for ship availability, take years. The proposed solution: containerized towed-array package deployable on any vessel without ship integration.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Question to Brian (DRDC): what operational/experimentation gap does a containerized towed-array solution fill?

**Speaker 3 (Brian, DRDC)**
Access to vessels is the key bottleneck. Canada's fleet is effectively four ships in readiness; new builds are decades away. Competing for a handful of platforms slows tech evaluation. A container system lets us shift test load onto other vessels of opportunity, avoiding ship schedule conflicts. It will speed technology development dramatically.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Question to Adam (Ultra): does modular containerization change procurement risk or scalability? Does it shorten timelines?

**Speaker 4 (Adam, Ultra)**
Yes — we already integrated sensors with winch/handling in the container, so only commercial interfaces remain. Payloads can be swapped quickly (low‑freq towed array to torpedo‑defense array). The ship hookup is simple.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Follow‑up to Brian: does this model make it easier to test, iterate, adopt emerging capabilities?

**Speaker 3 (Brian)**
Short answer yes; DRDC is talking to Ultra and others about modularizing their kit.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Question to Colin (Hobbal): mechanical design for repeatability and reliability across many vessel types; what keeps you up at night?

**Speaker 5 (Colin, Hobbal)**
We draw on 20 years of containerized systems for research vessels. The equipment must be invisible — fishermen mentality of no maintenance. Robustness is key. Systems have survived long transits (Sweden to Antarctic). Vibration during transport is a real issue; parts can break if not engineered for the journey.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Colin follow‑up: was Hobbal’s involvement on this project typical?

**Speaker 5 (Colin)**
We use Canadian collaboration rather than compete; working with Ultra and others builds stronger systems. Canada can lead if companies cooperate instead of fighting each other.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Back to Adam: is this a trials asset only or a product with broader defence/commercial application?

**Speaker 4 (Adam)**
Not just trials. The subsystem meets industry standards so it can serve as an operational asset, potentially uncrewed, on vessels of opportunity worldwide. We're designing it for full autonomy and future payload swaps.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Brian (in navy cap): will modular design support allied interoperability / export model?

**Speaker 3 (Brian)**
Yes — as soon as you fix on commercial interfaces you can loan it to allies. A NATO partner is already interested because their navy ship became unavailable. Containerized mission modules are where future ships (Type 26, Joint Support Ship, Arctic Offshore Patrol Vessels) are headed, so this aligns with broader trends.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Open question to all: what is still missing to accelerate underwater capability development in Canada (infrastructure, policy, procurement)?

**Speaker 3 (Brian)**
Policy: PWGSC procurement is slow and risk‑averse; they’ll cancel contracts to avoid lawsuits. The new defense industrial strategy is addressing this, but change is still top-down. We need real reform at PWGSC.

**Speaker 4 (Adam)**
Standards: programs must call out common, widely‑known standards instead of bespoke specs. Following commercial/NATO standards reduces non‑recurring engineering and shortens timelines.

**Speaker 5 (Colin)**
Openness and early dialogue among parties is essential. Speed matters for suppliers; long procurement cycles kill smaller companies. Collaboration across government, industry, and research accelerates progress.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Quick‑hit: 5‑year success metrics for modular capability?

**Speaker 3 (Brian)**
Have an "at‑sea research enabler" that can swap arrays, rapidly test, and deliver capability to warfighters.

**Speaker 4 (Adam)**
Rapid user feedback from DRDC on system performance to drive iterative improvements; move from prototype to autonomy.

**Speaker 5 (Colin)**
A deployable, mobilizable asset that can be on-scene within a day and modular enough for array changes; scalable and reliable.

**Speaker 2 (Andrew)**
Advice to innovators: what’s the most important thing to know about progressing trials?

**Speaker 4 (Adam)**
Don’t wait for perfection; 80% is enough to try and get real feedback. Fail fast, iterate.

**Speaker 3 (Brian)**
Canadian government can be a terrible first customer due to slow processes; don’t put all eggs in that basket. Start with foreign customers and then bring results back to Canada.

**Speaker 5 (Colin)**
Be ambitious, take risks, talk to people globally — progress comes from action, not spreadsheets and bureaucracy.

**Speaker 3 (Brian)**
DRDC has a collaboration agreement with COVE and an MoU with ISED for fund transfers via ACOA. These mechanisms exist to help Canadian companies; engage with the navy, air force, and DRDC if you have tech to test.

**Speaker 1 (Michelle)**
Closing remarks: honesty, speed, agility, and partnership are key. Panel will stay for questions; networking follows.
