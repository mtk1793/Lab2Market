## Transcript

**Mahmoud:** Thank you very much, thank you very much for being here. I was a little bit nervous because I had another routine just before that one. So I tried to finish it early and have this one because I'm super hyped about this. So again thank you very much for being here. I really would like to thank you — two weeks ago, we had that fantastic meeting and we talked about it since that moment. I thought about that from the beginning, especially your relationship with COVE. And yesterday I went to that event and it was a super fantastic one. I saw a couple of people, but unfortunately I didn't know them that much. So I talked with maybe a couple of them to understand what's going on, especially from the DRDC side, from the Navy. And yeah, I'm trying to be in touch with them.

So let me just start. My name is Mahmoud Kiasari. I'm doing my PhD at Dalhousie University. Around two years ago, I was in talk with a company that's working in 3D printing and additive manufacturing. So recently, we got entered inside a program named Lab2Market. And as you guys know, we have to talk with so many people. So far I talked with around 50 people, and every day I have to talk with more and more to gather more knowledge. So it's somewhat frustrating, but on the other hand it's going to be useful because I'm building connections and learning more.

Before talking more about my idea, I would like to ask you a couple of questions. The procedure of my meetings is that I ask questions first and then try to get feedback, then talk more about my idea. Would that be okay?

**Sheila:** Okay.

**Mahmoud:** Fantastic. By the way, since you're in the energy sector, I would like to maybe extend this conversation to also talk about my main major because my PhD is in electrical engineering and the work that I'm doing for Lab2Market is mechanical. Would that be okay?

**Sheila:** Yes, perfect.

### Q1 — Supply Chain Resilience Post-COVID

**Mahmoud:** So the very first question is about supply chain resilience, especially in the post-COVID era. From your role shaping NS energy and industrial strategy, how has the province's thinking shifted on local manufacturing capability since COVID and the recent US tariff situation? What was the effect on supply chain management?

**Sheila:** Yeah, perfect. So during COVID — and at that point I would have been representing COVE, so I was with COVE but had a pretty strong relationship with both federal and provincial governments. I'm speaking more from that experience. The immediate piece was the timing of COVID for the energy and ocean supply chain. It started, you know, really the lockdowns were in March. Many companies have a March ready-to-ship deliverable. And because in many cases companies are trying to deliver goods from offshore first, so that was an immediate risk, especially because with anything that might be a physical product, it typically means having people together in the same place.

So the role that I saw — with COVID I saw government take action. There was the matter of: can we support businesses by consolidating information and sharing it with them? The US Chamber of Commerce did a pretty good job — in the early days there were daily updates, instructions were changing for health and safety. They did a good job of trying to bring all that down into a short overview. And then the other piece was support funding programs, especially for companies that would be less than 250 people. That rolled out pretty much in 2020-2021. They were focused on anything that might relate to building manufacturing — improving deficiencies or manufacturing capacity, better equipment investment. But then the big one was people subsidy — I think it was a financial support or workforce subsidy. That happened immediately.

But I think what we've seen is that in some ways it forced really quick innovation. What we saw immediately for a short period of time was it reduced orders. But I think it permitted — gave a pass for, say, a company based in Canada — to have a pretty good shot at being able to export to other countries. Because what it reduced was how much reliance there was on the in-person meeting. What has carried through is: an in-person meeting is really important especially when it comes to sales, but it meant that the early meetings could very effectively be done through virtual meetings. So the kind of meeting we're having now wasn't very commonplace. It's made virtual meetings much more commonplace and accessible, and what that means is that even a very small company could have the presence of a larger company.

What's carried on there — we've seen actually in the same time frame a little bit of a shift in parts of our economy. Really there's a lot of growth that's ocean-related, like the energy industry. With ultra-deep oil and gas — and I think you mentioned it — it's very strong in offshore Labrador. That has certainly continued. They had to address operations but they really have grown in that period of time. There was a temporary dip in the price of oil and gas but it's back up.

And then in terms of the ocean sector, there have just in the last year or so been renewed or doubled-down investments on things like naval industry — like the River class destroyers going ahead. And then there's been additional investment — and that's what you probably heard a lot about yesterday — that ATDNL initiative, brand new in that time frame.

I tend to think we're in potentially a good spot here. The US would be, of course, unpredictable — it would be nice work. Under Trump, that obviously hurts. There have traditionally been multi-decade-long strong supply chain opportunities, and there are many places where an end product may go back and forth across the border, or there might be a blend of services provided by Canadian and American companies. We're seeing a very strong "buy American" piece which probably hurts a Canadian supplier into the US, but particularly into the defense sector, into offshore wind.

For the provincial government, there's been quite a focus especially in the last year on trade. The province is participating with the federal government — they might call it "Team Canada." There have been approaches about making sure that places other than Canada are aware of the Canadian goods and services offering — striking new trade relationships or new trade deals. The other one is interprovincial trade — trying to reduce trade barriers between provinces. There's much bigger focus on diversifying how many different markets there are.

**Mahmoud:** I completely agree. Thank you very much, especially when you're talking about the US tariffs.

### Q2 — OEM Commercialization & Technology Adoption

**Mahmoud:** My next question is about commercialization of new technology in the marine and energy sector. For our platform — we have to talk with OEMs — the very first thing they have concerns about is IP. We have to ensure them of trust. If you deal with a lot of OEMs in different sectors, when you try to adopt a new technology, what's the timeline, the procedure? How do they react — do they accept it or do they say no?

**Sheila:** Probably every company is gonna mean different groups. Some are very large, and within their company they may have multiple departments or multiple sections, so there are decent challenges. How do you reach the right individual person or the right place within the company? Research in advance is a way to get there — from their website, from understanding what they do, from LinkedIn and things like that.

So that's probably a big one — if you can show in your line of questions that you have definitely done your homework, that you understand what the company does and doesn't do. Understand if they develop in house, if they've had other partnerships, if they've acquired somebody, if they've had a joint venture. Look at their history especially when it comes to partnerships, joint ventures, or acquisitions of smaller companies — that might give you a feel for what their patterns or style is.

The other piece might be — there might be some business intelligence not just through the internet but through industry associations. For oil and gas, you might look at Oceans Advance. They've got a pretty nice website. In the offshore wind sector, you might look at Marine Renewables Canada. The number of outreach — that short conversation could maybe go a long way.

In a few cases the OEM might be located nearby, but usually there's also the matter of where are they? Are they in Europe? Are they in United States or somewhere else in Canada? Are they in Asia?

**Mahmoud:** Sometimes when you reach out to people, especially the older generation — people who say they like the old school way — the first conversation they like the idea, but at the end you find out they don't like it that much. Because they won't accept it unless there's some kind of higher-level signal — maybe from the government side, from the Navy, or any other department that says "doing it this way will be better for you." That's why I'm trying to talk with Navy and defense — I talked with Dalhousie, they liked my idea. I talked with Irving Shipbuilding. I talked with Lloyd's Register. If I go there and start a conversation with some logos saying "this guy is serious, let's listen to him" — that's what I'd like to have right now.

**Sheila:** Just a question back to you — are you certain that the OEM is actually your client? And wouldn't the client be somewhere else up the chain?

**Mahmoud:** The OEMs are not my clients — they are part of the ecosystem. Let me talk about the idea.

---

### Platform Explanation

**Mahmoud:** The idea is building an ecosystem between different entities — OEMs, end-user clients in any industry (oil and gas, aerospace, defense), 3D printing facilities, and regulators. After COVID, we found out: why not try to encourage different industries to instead of mainly focusing on physical inventories — trying to have all the parts in stock — why not focus on digital inventory? They do have a 3D printer on site, or they can find 3D printing facilities nearby in order to print the part they need.

Because we found out, especially in the Arctic areas of Canada, when they don't have one maybe $500 piece of equipment — which could be very simple — they have to shut down a million-dollar process. Why not try to have that? It doesn't take that much time or money from your side. But compare it with the fact that each day in oil and gas when you shut down the process, you're losing at least $500,000 to $1 million.

We would like to talk about digital inventory — and digital inventory is happening through our platform. We're offering a platform to the end user: instead of just ordering something from Europe, the US, China, or wherever — contacting the OEM wherever they are — one thing that we need from OEM is their blueprints. We are going to say: "Can I have your blueprints? Don't worry, I'm going to put it in a secure position. I'm going to give you a share." Because if they're using the printer — printing something — obviously they have to have a share of the revenue.

The end user, which could be anyone, can print that part on site rather than keeping it in the warehouse. We also talk about warehouse capital cost and obsolescence costs.

OEMs will share their blueprints with us, and then the end user — oil and gas, aerospace, Navy, defense, or anyone — can use it. That's the whole idea.

**Sheila:** So a big part of the value you'd be bringing is: they share the blueprint that would have been used for subtractive manufacturing, and you would develop the program for how to be able to print it exactly.

**Mahmoud:** Yeah, yeah — exactly as you just mentioned. We have a platform and — as someone mentioned to me — it's like the Airbnb model. We have the 3D printer on site, or if you don't have it you can share your neighbor's printer. And instead of getting the product from the OEM or manufacturer you can produce it on site. You would go on the platform, order something, you have to have OEM's permission, you have to have the regulation bodies — they have to be part of the process — and then you can have the parts.

The good thing about this idea is that we shouldn't aim for the top-tier, most critical industries or parts — at least not at first. We would like to start small, from non-critical parts, from parts that maybe you wouldn't put anywhere mission-critical. In the end we can prove it works and move up.

By the way, have you heard about PolyUnity? They're in Newfoundland, very active. They have almost the same business plan as us but they're working in medical. We talked with them — I talked with the co-founder two days ago and he showed interest in our idea and told me maybe we can have a collaboration.

**Sheila:** That's interesting. The IP is gonna be huge — security, making sure your stuff isn't gonna get hacked. And then quality assurance. And also the matter of how — some of these companies are concerned about having a generic replacement at a lower cost. But I also wonder if some of those companies — providing spare parts is more of a service, like they're maintaining customer relationships — but some of them, that might be off to the side, it's not their core interest. It could be that there are companies who would rather still have their customer be served but they don't want to do it themselves.

**Mahmoud:** Yeah, completely agree.

### Q3 — COVE as a Pilot / Ecosystem Support

**Mahmoud:** Yesterday at the COVE event, one of them mentioned about the support that COVE can have for different industries, maybe startups. I would like to know — building the team, because right now it's just me and my industrial partner. I'm doing everything — development, talking, research. But in the future I really would like to have some support.

I got mostly positive feedback, and people told me they appreciate that this is Canada-made. I want to be the first company inside Canada that could do this. Europe is doing something; the US is probably working on that. But I would like to be first in Canada. So is COVE a great source to reach out to people and say "I have this idea, can you introduce me to someone?" Who should I talk to right now?

**Sheila:** I would absolutely suggest working with COVE, especially on the New Ventures side. They may be able to share with you who they've got. I'm not sure this is the right title, but there's somebody at COVE in Venture Growth — a manager — so that may be the person to talk to. Take a look at their team. They also do — I think here and there they'll have — they're interested in building their understanding of what entrepreneurs are at early to earlier stages. And do they have the ability to work directly with companies?

In terms of verticals, working with them on especially the marine sector would be their core obviously, but a lot of companies that work in the marine sector also have other verticals they support.

You might want to look through their website first. In the event there's an event coming up or something like that, you should make sure you're there. For a competition of some kind. And it's a little bit farther in the future, but early June would be a good idea to look at the H2O conference — H2O as in water. That's worth attending, and it's lined up with the COVE Demo Day, so those few days in June would probably be a good networking opportunity.

You could go in for student rate because you're a PhD student. They have programming that relates to venture growth, the growth of entrepreneurial businesses. They have competitions. But you can also just reach out to people there that work on investment discussion — they focus on early-stage companies, acceleration programs, incubation programs. 

The thing is you could probably fit into more than one sector — you could be advanced manufacturing, or marine technology, or more of an ICT style. So there are multiple options.

**Mahmoud:** I also mentioned ITB and NRC-IRAP — I'm trying to put them on my radar. Recently I was talking with Irving Shipbuilding and that person was suggesting ITB because apparently he was also part of that program. But the issue about ITB is that you should already have a team and have a project to propose. Since right now my work is at a very beginning stage, I still have to use other kinds of funding first.

**Sheila:** Yeah, but we'd also strongly suggest looking at Invest Nova Scotia, because that's a big piece of what they do — you're launching a venture, it's growing. They would have potential support. They can have things like support for accessing legal support for intellectual property and accessing human resources, HR skill sets, but also things like consulting — because you might be trying to determine what the rest of your team looks like. 

I would say you're already gifted in that. I see a number of business entrepreneurs who have technical strength but sometimes lack the ability to determine: is it more of an operations kind of person, is it more of a financial person? And maybe you don't need your team to be huge with full-time people. Perhaps it's a matter of accessing, especially as you're growing, people part-time — a more experienced person for a smaller number of hours.

**Mahmoud:** Yeah, completely understand. Perfect, thank you very much. So that's done with this project. Can we have maybe another 10-15 minutes to spare on my PhD topic?

**Sheila:** All right, yeah.

### Extra Topics

**Mahmoud:** So you mentioned Lloyd's Register — they also have a Lloyd's Register Foundation, which is more focused on innovation, softer, supporting the industry, supporting people as they grow. So you could think about the two parts of Lloyd's Register — the one that's very present in Halifax that you may have already talked to, but also the wider Foundation that's more about encouraging innovation and what's coming next.

**Sheila:** I also just thought of another potential user — it might be somebody like IMP Aerospace. They're based here and they have probably 10 different companies within them. The biggest part of the company does maintenance, repair, and overhaul for aircraft.

**Mahmoud:** Aircraft is somewhere I already talked with someone. They're very conservative. I talked with a company — I think it was GKN in the UK — and they told me "don't come near us, we don't want it." That makes sense — if you have a part and if it was going to fail, you're talking about lives, hundreds of lives. So they won't risk it.

But about another side of aerospace — spacecraft and what I'd call non-passenger spacecraft, things outside of the world, maybe satellites — I talked with two companies: Reaction Dynamics and Galaxia. I just had a talk with the CEO of Galaxia before your call, and I talked about my pitch. He liked it — there are some doubts about it, that completely makes sense. But since these companies are using 3D printers, they're easier to approach because one important part is convincing an industry to have a printer. These companies already use it. And one of the guys mentioned to me — at the beginning I was very disappointed with aerospace, but he told me: "When you're talking about a normal airplane, they need a part that works for four years. But when you're talking about our industry — just four minutes. We're transporting trash," I mean not trash obviously but not lives at least. That's a very, very good point.

**Sheila:** Yeah. Do you know the group at UNB who does the Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence?

**Mahmoud:** Yes, I talked with their main guy — Mr. Osman. Super nice guy, and he kind of opened my eye about it. He said the idea that you have is good but it still needs work. Because he was one of the pioneers in working with the Navy — he came up with the idea to work with Dalhousie and other parts and try to use additive manufacturing under ship, in submarines and other things. There are some problems with that, but yeah, he was a great guy. I'm probably going to see him again in the summer. He also encouraged me: yeah, it's not a bad idea, but there's a lot of work.

**Sheila:** And just the last thing I'll mention — think about who has the responsibility for things like repair. Because in many cases it may not be cost — it would be the time, isn't it even available, and then how long does it take to show up?

**Mahmoud:** Yes, that's a very important part because after downtime cost, that steps up before the money. Obviously money matters, but timing is important and repair is also another factor. One of the people in Lab2Market is working on the repair part — I'm talking about replacement, not repair at this point. But I also try to get in touch with him to see what he has in mind and maybe find some collaboration.

**Sheila:** I suppose when I say repair I'm thinking more — if I'm gonna repair something within a ship, it probably means at some point I find out there's a root cause: one of the parts has failed. And then we're replacing that part — that's really part of the replacement — but someone has responsibility for repair of the whole system. So there may be more intermediaries who do managed repairs.

### PhD Energy Research — CAPSM Context

**Mahmoud:** Since you're at the energy sector — are you guys interested in having new technologies in your area or do you still prefer the old school?

**Sheila:** Well, personally — remember this, in a government role it's more so to look into — enable. So what are we looking to enable? We're ultimately looking to enable that there are good lives for Nova Scotians. That means industry is strong, the economy is strong. That means if you have reliability of energy — in all forms but electricity is available, you can rely on it, it's priced appropriately — because that's important for individual homes but also really important in terms of how competitive it is for services to locate here, and then industry. And also we'd like to see that it's socially acceptable and environmentally sound.

The government's not in the role of specifying what types of technology are used. We wouldn't get to the level of specifying exactly what kind of technologies are used — obviously we have safety regulatory type. My neighboring departments would have that safety oversight, probably drawing on the Canadian Standards Association. There's generally a pretty strong openness to new technologies, but it will typically be the buyer who's making that decision — so that might be the developer. 

For the province, we might give instructions or in the future directions through the regulator that would say there's going to be a procurement for this capacity of renewable energy — onshore wind, offshore wind, solar, battery storage — there's just been a battery storage project tendered. The government's role is in setting that direction, but then hands off in terms of exactly what technology is used, so long as they are safe, meet requirements, are cost-effective — and it's really nice if they were Canadian, but you don't mandate that because there are trade laws.

**Mahmoud:** Recently when I was talking with engineers from Nova Scotia Power — they're apparently trying to adjust themselves with the technology, not just AI but different kinds of softwares. Everything is expanding and you cannot expect the old school way. My work in my master's was using battery storage of electrical vehicles connected to the grid — V2G, vehicle to grid. I shifted my focus from there somehow, but I'm still focusing on that. And recently we're entering different projects with industries like Everwind — I'm not sure about the name but they have wind projects and battery storage. Part of our team and I myself are working on more development and trying to be in contact with different industries to see what their need is.

One thing I found is that technology is a must. The big plan that Nova Scotia had about 2030 and 2050 really needs some big work. Recently Mr. Juston also went to announce a new venture — some kind of company was Renewal, I think. I was also working with that company in one of the development sides. So I have a broad picture of what's going on. And it is really good to see that Nova Scotia is actually moving towards that. It means I can approach different industries.

By the way, when you mention government procurement — yesterday the DRDC person also mentioned that procurement and paperwork takes a lot of time. One of the issues he mentioned — the idea is okay, but it's about the time. If I come up to you with some kind of new safe technology and say "I talked with this one, I validated my work based on this" — how much acceleration can I see from the government side?

**Sheila:** It's probably highly specific to the actual product or market you're in. And if you're trying to work with things that have some heavy certifications — as a certification body, that's as conservative as you can get. It can be a very slow way to go. So the question is: do you need to go as the seller of the solution, or do you need to find someone who is really keen on being your buyer? They already very strongly understand the certification bodies, so it could be that they help make that happen.

You've gotta remember that very few cases would the provincial government be your buyer. In the defense sector, yes, the ultimate buyer could be government, but you might be more in the situation where there are government acceleration programs — something that's somewhat slow to approve, but the prize or the offer is meant to support and accelerate your business growth. Maybe it's access to people, or it might be supporting a percentage of an equipment or investment that's needed.

The province is often quite a bit faster than the federal government, but the federal government is where the money is. I would keep your eyes on that.

What NRC does would be worthwhile to understand — they do work with small to medium-sized companies and try to be as fast as possible. Those things are not enough to base your full business plan on, but if you have your business plan individually, you can look at where there might be a program that fits. NRC-IRAP and then Invest Nova Scotia — that's a big piece of what they do in supporting small companies.

For energy specifically, the province might give instructions or direction to a regulator to do procurement, but we're not usually actually funding it ourselves. In this sector — for healthcare, yes, hospitals procure things. But for energy, we're typically setting the boundaries and instructions to those who are providing energy — whether that's the regulator working with Nova Scotia Power, or the regulator who oversees oil and gas exploration or offshore in the future.

### Upcoming Events

**Mahmoud:** Probably at the end of next month there would be a conference event — it's in Toronto. I probably would be there and try to talk with different industries. I really would like to show my MVP and say "this is the idea, this is my PhD, what do you think?" and hopefully find some buyers and investors.

**Sheila:** Yeah, Engine is a great organization. And I think they're quite tightly lined up with the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters as well. Before arriving at that conference, take a look at who's speaking and who's attending — can you make some outreach on LinkedIn? While you're in Ontario, is there anybody or anywhere you might want to look? Maybe Waterloo Ontario or wherever. It's worthwhile.

Also there are a couple of other events coming up. You should be careful not to pay too much — you might be able to get a student rate. For the energy sector, there's one called Smart Energy, which is around April 14. Everyone would be there. It's more of a networking thing than a detailed technology conference, but it's electricity and all energies.

And then for offshore wind, that same organization — Marine Renewables Canada — does something called the Sector Vision, which is the division for how offshore wind should grow. I think they were holding a webinar about it. That might be more of an information source, but there's quite a bit of information on their website.

The other organization that has a website with a decent amount of content relating to the energy sector is called Invest Atlantic. I know you probably know that.

You were with Lucas Juans? 

**Mahmoud:** No, I mean... it's a little complicated, but I know him, yeah. I was with Dr. Hamad Ali — electrical engineering.

**Sheila:** OK, so you're there for your masters and also for your PhD.

**Mahmoud:** Yes, yes, both of them.

### Closing

**Mahmoud:** Thank you very much — that was almost one hour. I'm sorry for exceeding. Everything was interesting. And one last question — probably again, as you can see, I'm gathering so much knowledge from everywhere. But maybe in the future if I find something interesting that might also be interesting from the energy sector side — would it be okay if I send you an email and ask for another time to chat?

**Sheila:** Sure. Yeah, that's okay.

**Mahmoud:** That's fantastic. Thank you very much for that. Have a great weekend! Bye bye.

**Sheila:** Thanks. Bye.
