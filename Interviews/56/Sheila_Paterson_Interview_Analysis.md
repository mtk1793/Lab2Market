## Executive Summary

One of the most information-dense interviews in the Lab2Market program. Sheila validated the core supply chain pain driving the platform, independently articulated the OEM blueprint-licensing model, and provided a specific and credible roadmap of programs, events, and contacts to pursue. She also offered a significant insight on the government's role — not a buyer of technology, but a direction-setter — which has direct implications for commercialization strategy. The interview extended into the PhD/CAPSM domain, confirming the same commercialization logic applies to energy AI: target developers and IPPs, not government.

**Overall Signal: Strongly Positive + High Strategic Value**

## Key Validations

### 1. COVID Supply Chain Fragility — Core Platform Pain Confirmed
> *"Many companies have a March ready-to-ship deliverable... with anything that might be a physical product, it typically means having people together in the same place."*

Sheila confirmed from a policy-level vantage point that COVID exposed exactly the fragility that the digital inventory platform addresses. Physical inventory and offshore supplier dependence were the primary vulnerabilities. **Validation of the founding thesis.**

### 2. Platform Model Immediately Understood
When Mahmoud explained the digital inventory / on-demand AM model, Sheila immediately paraphrased it accurately:
> *"A big part of the value you'd be bringing is: they share the blueprint that would have been used for subtractive manufacturing, and you would develop the program for how to be able to print it exactly."*

This is the clearest top-down restatement of the model from any interviewee. No confusion about what the platform does — the value proposition is comprehensible to a senior policy/industry figure.

### 3. Start with Non-Critical Parts — Strategy Validated
Mahmoud articulated the "start small, non-critical parts" strategy. Sheila did not challenge it. Implicitly endorsed the phased approach.

### 4. OEMs May *Prefer* Not to Manage Spare Parts
> *"I also wonder if some of those companies — providing spare parts is more of a service... but some of them, that might be off to the side, it's not their core interest. It could be that there are companies who would rather still have their customer be served, but they don't want to do it themselves."*

**This is a critical reframe.** Rather than OEMs being resistant partners to convince, many OEMs may actually *welcome* a platform that serves their customers on their behalf — removing a non-core burden while maintaining revenue share. This changes the sales motion: OEM as willing licensor, not skeptic.

## Critical Challenges Raised

### 1. IP Security and Quality Assurance — Top Two Barriers
> *"The IP is gonna be huge — security, making sure your stuff isn't gonna get hacked. And then quality assurance."*

Consistent with every other interview. These are the two non-negotiable barriers before OEM participation at scale. The platform must have demonstrable answers to both before approaching OEMs formally.

### 2. Government is NOT the Buyer (for the Platform)
> *"Very few cases would the provincial government be your buyer... In the defense sector, yes, the ultimate buyer could be government, but you might be more so in the situation where there are government acceleration programs."*

The NS government's role is to set direction for energy/ocean procurement — not to directly procure technology. This means:
- **Do not spend excessive effort trying to get government to endorse or buy AddManuChain directly**
- Instead: pursue government *validation logos*, *acceleration programs*, and *introductions to buyers*
- Real buyers remain: oil & gas operators, MRO companies, defense primes, AM-adopting aerospace startups

### 3. Certification Bodies Are the Bottleneck
> *"If you're trying to work with things that have heavy certifications — as a certification body, that's as conservative as you can get. It can be a very slow way to go."*

Her suggestion: don't lead with the certification body as your path to market. Instead, find a buyer who already understands certification and has the relationship — they can help navigate it.

### 4. IMP Aerospace: High Ceiling, High Barrier
Sheila introduced IMP Aerospace as a potential user. However, MRO for aircraft is exactly the segment that rejected AddManuChain outright (GKN/UK). Mahmoud confirmed the aircraft AM timeline (4-year part life vs. 4-minute satellite part) insight from Galaxia. **IMP Aerospace MRO = cautionary segment. IMP non-aircraft divisions may be more approachable.**

## Insights for PhD/CAPSM Commercialization

Sheila made it clear that:
1. Government sets direction (e.g., "we will procure X GW of offshore wind, X MW of battery storage") but does not specify technology
2. The actual technology buyer is the **developer/IPP** (independent power producer) or **regulated utility**
3. Province can *point* to programs that accelerate adoption but won't buy CAPSM directly

**Implication for CAPSM:** Target Everwind, Nova Scotia Power (through regulator relationship), battery storage project developers (e.g., the recent NS battery storage tender), and offshore wind developers. These are the buyers who can select CAPSM as their grid control AI. Government acceleration programs (province faster, but federal has more money) are funding vehicles, not buyers.

Sheila also noted NS is in a "good spot" for energy growth: Labrador ultra-deep oil & gas, River class destroyers, ATDNL, offshore wind expansion. These are all high-value sectors where grid reliability and energy management optimization (CAPSM use case) are active problems.

## Repair vs. Replacement — Segment Refinement

Sheila raised the **MRO intermediate layer**: for a ship, the party responsible for "repair of the whole system" may not be the operator — it may be an MRO contractor. This MRO contractor is the real decision-maker for spare parts.

**Implication:** When mapping the AM platform customer journey for defense/vessel sectors:
- The **buyer of parts** = MRO contractor (e.g., Irving Ship Repair for Halifax class)
- The **operator** (Navy) consumes but doesn't procure
- The **OEM** (e.g., Thales, Rolls-Royce for propulsion) licenses the blueprint
- The **regulation body** (DNV, Lloyd's, CSA) certifies the part

This 4-player model should be central to platform go-to-market in the defense/marine vertical.

## Insight: Lab2Market — UNB Marine AM Centre of Excellence

Sheila sent the link to the [Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence (MAMCE) at UNB](https://www.unb.ca/research/institutes-centres/mmri/mamce/) during the call. This is Ahmad Osman's group — the same person Mahmoud has already spoken with and plans to visit in person in the summer.

**Why this matters for AddManuChain:**
- MAMCE is the only dedicated marine AM centre in Canada — the natural institutional home for a platform that connects OEMs, shipbuilders, and regulators through digital inventory and on-demand AM
- Ahmad Osman's group has the Navy/DND relationship (the same Halifax-class work Mahmoud referenced) — having MAMCE as a partner or endorser provides the credibility logo needed to open doors with Irving Ship Repair, Thales, and defense procurement officers
- MAMCE can serve as a **technical validation partner**: if a part is printed through the platform, MAMCE's certification-adjacent expertise could be part of the quality assurance workflow
- Potential collaboration paths: pilot program, MOU, co-authoring a white paper on digital AM inventory for shipbuilding supply chains, or an NSERC Alliance grant co-application

**Recommended next action:** In the in-person summer meeting with Ahmad Osman at UNB, bring a specific proposal for MAMCE's role in the platform pilot — not just a catch-up, but a structured partnership ask. Frame it as: "MAMCE validates parts; AddManuChain manages the secure blueprint workflow and procurement." This also unlocks ITB eligibility conversation (Dr. Osman's DND connections are precisely the "team" component ITB requires).

## Insight: PhD Thesis (CAPSM) — Net Zero Atlantic + Marine Renewables Canada

Sheila sent two links relevant to the PhD/CAPSM energy side:

**1. [Net Zero Atlantic](https://netzeroatlantic.ca)** — Halifax-based applied research organization leading Canada's offshore wind, tidal, hydrogen, geothermal, and energy system modelling work. Their R&D roadmap was shaped by 63 experts identifying 22 priorities for offshore wind in Atlantic Canada. They run workshops, forums, and have a research portal.

**2. [Marine Renewables Canada](https://marinerenewables.ca)** — National industry body aligning industry, academia, and government on marine renewable energy. Currently promoting the **Sector Vision 2050** — a 14-recommendation pathway for marine renewable energy as a pillar of Canada's clean energy transition. Upcoming: "Vision to 2050 – Powering Our Clean Energy Future" webinar + 2026 annual conference.

**Why this matters for CAPSM:**
- CAPSM's System-2 (quantum-inspired RL/MARL) and metacognitive arbitration layer are directly applicable to the **complex grid management challenges** that offshore wind, tidal, and distributed energy resources (DER) create — intermittency, grid stability, real-time dispatch decisions under uncertainty
- Net Zero Atlantic actively seeks applied research partnerships and industrial collaborators — CAPSM validates on 9/39/118/300-bus test systems which maps directly onto the kind of offshore-wind-integrated regional grids Atlantic Canada is building
- Marine Renewables Canada membership provides access to IPPs, developers, and utilities who are the **real buyers** of grid control technology (as Sheila confirmed: government sets direction, developers choose the technology)
- The MRC "Sector Vision 2050" webinar is a low-cost entry point to get on the radar of offshore wind developers who need AI-based grid management

**Recommended next actions:**
1. Attend the upcoming MRC webinar "Vision to 2050" — introduce yourself as a Dalhousie PhD researcher working on AI-based grid control; collect developer/IPP contacts
2. Reach out to Net Zero Atlantic's research team about their energy system modelling work — offer CAPSM as a candidate AI layer for their offshore wind grid integration studies; propose a joint paper or research collaboration
3. Consider submitting a short abstract to the MRC 2026 annual conference about CAPSM's application to marine/offshore renewable grid management — positions the PhD work in an applied industry-facing context
