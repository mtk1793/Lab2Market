# Interview Questions — Sheila Paterson P.Eng.
**Interviewee:** Director of Strategic Priorities, NS Dept. of Energy & Natural Resources; former COO at COVE; 20+ years in marine, aerospace MRO, and clean tech.  
**Project context:** AddManuChain — an ecosystem for additive manufacturing and 3D printing of spare parts, built around digital inventory, OEM IP management, and supply chain resilience for maritime and industrial sectors.

**CAPSM/PhD context:** In parallel I’m developing the CAPSM framework (Cognitive-Adaptive Power System Management), a brain-inspired dual-process control architecture for electric grid control. You may hear me mention it in our conversation.

### CAPSM Questions
1. My PhD proposal – CAPSM – is a brain-inspired dual-process control architecture for power‑grid management. Do you see any relevance of that kind of fast/slow arbitration logic to the kinds of problems your group is solving, or any partners who might be interested in a software‑defined ‘reflex + planner’ platform?
2. I’m looking for opportunities to pilot CAPSM algorithms on real systems (utility micro‑grids, DER fleets, etc.). Can you think of any industry contacts, testbeds or funding streams that would welcome a physics‑consistent reflex‑planning framework, or that are already exploring similar dual‑layer AI?

### Q1 — Supply chain resilience post-COVID from a government lens
From your role shaping NS energy and industrial strategy, how has the province's thinking shifted on local manufacturing capability since COVID and the recent US tariff volatility? Is digital-first, on-demand spare part production something the government would actively support as a supply chain resilience strategy?

### Q2 — Commercialisation path for an early-stage maritime supply chain platform
You spent years at the NS government encouraging commercialisation of new technologies — especially in marine and energy sectors. For a platform like ours that touches OEMs, 3D printing facilities, and digital inventory, what is the most practical on-ramp into the Nova Scotia market? Are there specific programs (ACOA, NSBI, scale-up funds) or procurement vehicles we should be targeting first?

### Q3 — OEM trust and IP: lessons from the National Shipbuilding Strategy
Under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, you led work on supplier capacity and innovation partnerships. OEMs are the critical gatekeepers for digital blue­prints in our model. Based on your experience working with industrial IP holders in the marine and defence space, what does it actually take to earn that trust, and how long does it realistically take?

### Q4 — MRO and process improvement: where does additive manufacturing fit?
At IMP Group you drove continuous-improvement across a 1 500-person aerospace MRO operation while contracts shifted from cost-plus to fixed-price — exactly the pressure maritime operators face today. In your view, which maintenance and spare-part workflows are the most promising candidates for additive manufacturing to replace or supplement traditional procurement?

### Q5 — Regulatory and certification readiness in NS
As Director of Strategic Priorities for energy, you work at the intersection of clean investment and regulation. What is the current regulatory appetite in Nova Scotia for certifying additively-manufactured parts in marine or energy applications? Are there classification bodies or government working groups we should be engaging with early to shape that framework?

### Bonus Q1 — COVE as a platform for ecosystem pilots
During your time as COO, COVE hosted many industry-government-research collaborations. Would COVE (or a similar hub) be a viable site to run a live pilot of our digital inventory and on-demand printing model with a marine operator? Who specifically at COVE would be the right contact?

### Bonus Q2 — Referrals
You sit at the nexus of government, marine industry, and innovation funding in Atlantic Canada. Are there two or three people — on the OEM side, within DFO or DND supply chains, or in the offshore energy sector — you would suggest we speak with next?
