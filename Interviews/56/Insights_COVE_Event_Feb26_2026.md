# Insights — COVE Oceans Connector Panel (Feb 26 2026)
**Event:** Oceans Connector, COVE Halifax  
**Focus:** Containerized towed-array solution for rapid underwater sensing trials  
**Panelists:** DRDC, Ultra Marine, Hobbal  

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Vessel access is the biggest bottleneck for marine experimentation
– Canada’s effective operational fleet is ~4 ships; new builds are years away.  
– Traditional trials must compete with operational deployments, crew rest, port calls.  
**Opportunity:** Containerized modules let us shift trials onto ‘vessels of opportunity’, decoupling testing from navy schedules.

### 2. Modular container design reduces integration risk & shortens timelines
– Ultra: sensor payload + winch already pre‑integrated; only commercial power/data interfaces remain.  
– Payloads (low‑freq array, torpedo‑defense, etc.) can be swapped with minimal reconfiguration.  
**Benefit:** Faster hookup on ships; easier to iterate between different sensor types.

### 3. Engineering reliability is paramount for mobile systems
– Hobbal’s background building containerized gear for fishermen emphasises robustness (“nobody wants to notice your system”).  
– Vibration during long transport (truck/air) can break components — design must account for this.  
**Implication:** A field‑deployable asset must survive transit and operate autonomously.

### 4. Canadian collaboration, not competition, strengthens capability
– Hobbal and Ultra teamed voluntarily rather than bidding against each other.  
– Panelists stressed the potential for Canada to lead if firms work together.  
**Lesson:** Partnerships can produce exportable, innovative solutions.

### 5. The containerised concept is aligned with future naval architecture
– Modern ships (Type 26, JSS, Arctic OPVs) have mission‑module spaces for 20‑ft containers.  
– Allies are already interested; a NATO partner may borrow the unit for trials.  
**Implication:** This approach supports interoperability and exportability.

### 6. Policy & procurement remain hurdles
– PWGSC’s risk‑averse, slow processes frustrate defence innovators; new defence industrial strategy is promising but change is nascent.  
– Using common industry/NATO standards reduces non‑recurring engineering and eases procurement.  
**Actionable:** Engage early with procurement agencies; leverage new funding channels (DRDC‑COVE collaboration agreement, MoU with ISED/ACOA).

### 7. Commercialisation message for innovators
– Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good; deploy prototypes (≥80%) to get real feedback.  
– Diversify customer base; don’t rely solely on Canadian government.  
– Talk widely, collaborate globally, and embrace risk — these are the keys to export success.

### 8. Success metric (5‑year horizon)
– A deployable “at‑sea research enabler” that can swap arrays and push capability rapidly to warfighters.  
– The system should be mobilisable within a day and robust enough for field service.  
– Continuous user feedback loop with DRDC to iterate designs.

## Hypotheses Validated
| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Trials are delayed by limited ship availability | ✅ | Panelists agreed; navy ~4‑ship bottleneck |
| Containerization lowers barriers | ✅ | Ultra & DRDC descriptions of ease-of-hookup |
| Canadian industry collaboration creates stronger outcomes | ✅ | Hobbal/Ultra cooperation cited |
| Government procurement is slow/risk-averse | ✅ | DRDC comments on PWGSC behaviour |
| Modular modules support allied interoperability | ✅ | NATO partner interest mentioned |

## Recommended Next Actions
1. Share insights with Lab2Market team and update CRM with DRDC/Ultra/Hobbal contacts.  
2. Investigate whether AddManuChain could co‑pilot a containerised module for 3D‑printed spare parts or digital inventory trials.  
3. Reach out to DRDC via Michelle at COVE to explore partnership/funding opportunities under the new MoU.  
4. Prepare briefing on procurement pain points for MW (investor) and align value proposition with "mobile, modular, risk‑reduced" language.
5. Monitor outcome of NATO partner interest — could be a path to export.
