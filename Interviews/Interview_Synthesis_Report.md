# AddManuChain Interview Synthesis Report
## Comprehensive Findings from 26 Customer Discovery Interviews

**Program:** Lab2Market | **Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Researcher:** Mahmoud Kiasari | **Affiliation:** Dalhousie University  
**Total Interviews Analyzed:** 26 (across 14 industries, 4 countries)

---

## Executive Summary

Over 26 customer discovery interviews were conducted between January and February 2026, engaging stakeholders across marine/offshore, defense, mining, utilities, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, and ecosystem organizations. This synthesis distills the recurring themes, validates or challenges core hypotheses, and refines the platform's strategic direction.

### Top 5 Strategic Findings

1. **IP protection is the #1 adoption barrier** — universally cited across all industries, more important than cost or time (Interviews 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27)
2. **Working capital liberation (not warehouse savings) is the CFO-level ROI driver** — reframes the entire value proposition from operational to financial (Interviews 15, 18, 25, 30)
3. **Equinor Bay du Nord is the ideal beachhead** — Greenfield project with no legacy warehouse, already doing AM in Norway, will break down barriers for other operators (Interview 27)
4. **AI should enhance supply chain fundamentals, not replace them** — multiple interviewees cautioned against leading with AI before solving the underlying process (Interviews 25, 28)
5. **Certification is a 2+ year gatekeeper** — but utilities self-certify and temporary parts bypass this entirely (Interviews 23, 27, 30)

## 3. Key Themes

### 3.1 IP Protection: The Universal Blocker

**Finding:** Every industry stakeholder — from O&G to defense to manufacturing — identified IP protection as the primary barrier to digital inventory adoption.

**Evidence:**
- **Jim Granger (MAN Energy):** *"15 years at General Electric taught me — companies don't want to share IP. It doesn't matter how strong the NDA is."*
- **John Lidstone (Atlantic XL):** *"You have to make sure the OEM has relinquished the IP… or prove that the IP is void or expired."* — IP clearance is a multi-step manual process blocking AM adoption
- **Khashayar (Dalhousie Lab):** Even within academic networks, materials are sent as "black box" to other universities — confidentiality is paramount
- **Nicole Rathie (NGen):** Advocated for on-premise processing (Select AM model) over cloud-based repositories
- **Assembly Studio:** Built their entire business model around local encrypted storage (Raspberry Pi 5, no cloud)
- **Keith Healey (ERINL):** *"OEMs see it as a threat to a loss of business. Operators fear legal consequences."*
- **Kwadwo Ampofo (Deloitte):** Obsolete parts are the workaround — *"Nobody cares about copyright when nobody's manufacturing it"*

**Solution Framework:**
1. **Short-term:** Focus on obsolete parts (no IP barriers) + AI-powered patent/IP search for expired designs (John Lidstone)
2. **Medium-term:** Consortium model with per-print royalties to OEMs
3. **Long-term:** On-premise encrypted processing (Assembly Studio model)

---

### 3.2 The Working Capital Reframe

**Finding:** The ROI conversation must shift from "reduce warehouse costs" to "liberate working capital."

**Evidence:**
- **Kwadwo Ampofo:** *"More spare parts = increased working capital with NO benefits. If it becomes a CFO problem, that's when decision makers do anything."*
- **Adam Chubbs:** First quantitative data — **$4-5M inventory for $50M asset base** (8-10% ratio)
- **OMV Austria (Chris/Mikhail):** 15% ROI threshold required for any technology investment
- **Assembly Studio:** Confirmed working capital optimization as core value proposition

**Quantified ROI Model:**
| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Inventory-to-asset ratio | 8-10% | Adam Chubbs (30) |
| **Inventory per offshore vessel** | **$30-50M** | Jason Power (4) |
| **Vessel value** | **$500M-$1B** | Jason Power (4) |
| Inventory holding cost | 20-30%/year of value | Kwadwo Ampofo (25) |
| $10M inventory example | $2.5M/year holding cost | Kwadwo's calculation |
| 30% inventory reduction | $3M freed + $750K/year saved | Kwadwo's calculation |
| Preservation costs | Ongoing (unquantified) for $200K turbos | Adam Chubbs (30) |
| Mining downtime | $500K-$1M/day | Assembly Studio (20) |
| **Offshore drilling downtime** | **$500K-$1M/day** | Jason Power (4) |

### 3.3 Customer Segmentation Matrix

Based on all interviews, a clear segmentation emerged:

| Segment | Pain Level | AM Readiness | Ado
ption Timeline | Key Barrier | Best Approach |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Defense/Naval** | 🔴 Critical | ✅ High | 1-2 years | Sovereign capability | Government anchor tenant |
| **Greenfield O&G (Equinor)** | 🔴 High | ✅ High | 2-3 years | Regulatory pathway | Beachhead customer |
| **Remote Utilities** | 🟡 High | ✅ Medium | 2-3 years | Self-certification specs | AI asset intelligence |
| **Marine Distributors** | 🟡 Medium | ⚠️ Medium | 2-4 years | Time vs helicopter | Custom fabricated parts |
| **Brownfield O&G (Suncor)** | 🟢 Low urgency | ⚠️ Low | 5+ years | Existing infrastructure | Wait for Equinor proof |
| **Tier 1 O&G Majors** | 🟢 Very low | ❌ Very low | 5+ years | *"Deep pockets, don't care"* | Don't target directly |
| **Mining (Arctic)** | 🔴 High pain | ❌ Low readiness | 5+ years | Volume mismatch | AI inventory only (no AM) |

---

### 3.4 The Certification Landscape

**Finding:** Certification is a 2+ year process, but multiple pathways exist.

| Pathway | Timeline | Applies To | Source |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Lloyd's Register full certification | 2+ years (86 templates) | Marine structural parts | John Lidstone (6) |
| DNV/ABS/Lloyd's full certification | 2+ years | Marine structural parts | Jim Granger (23) |
| C-NLOPB + C-CORE validation | 1+ years (if engaged early) | Offshore NL operations | Keith Healey (27) |
| CSA/UL certification | 6-18 months | Electrical components | Keith Healey (27) |
| Self-certification (utilities) | Internal process | Non-public utility environments | Adam Chubbs (30) |
| Temporary/non-certified parts | Immediate | Emergency naval/marine use | Lee Vessey (13) |
| CNC-equivalent standards | Existing framework | Treat AM like CNC machining | Andrew Smith (28) |

**Critical Insight (Keith Healey):** *"If you engage the regulator and certified authority along the way, you'll break down those barriers. If you just pass it over after, it'll take a year, maybe year and a half."*

---

### 3.5 The AI Positioning Debate

Interviewees were divided on AI's role. The synthesis reveals a nuanced position:

| Position | Advocates | Key Argument |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **AI is critical** | Jim Granger, Keith Healey, Lee Vessey | Workforce knowledge gap makes AI essential; *"Those guys are gone"* |
| **AI should not lead** | Kwadwo Ampofo, Andrew Smith | *"Solve supply chain fundamentals first. AI will muddy the waters."* |
| **AI for prediction, not QA** | Andrew Smith, Adam Chubbs | Predictive maintenance yes; quality assurance has hallucination risk |
| **Proprietary AI only** | Jim Granger (MAN), OMV | *"We've tried to narrow it to our data instead of large language models"* |

**Recommended Position:** AI as an enhancement layer on top of proven supply chain fundamentals — specifically MRP integration, buffer management, and demand-driven replenishment. Never lead with "AI-powered" in pitch. Start with AI inventory optimization (Jason Power) and feasibility assessment (John Lidstone), then layer in AM capability.

---

### 3.6 The Integrator Pivot

**Finding (Jason Power, Interview 4):** End-user operators (Noble, Shell, etc.) do NOT decide which manufacturing methods to use. The real decision-makers are **integrators/OEMs** (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes, Weatherford).

> *"The idea of using AM goes back to whether individual supplier vendors would like to use that or not. In the concept of big industries like oil and gas, it's not that meaningful [to target operators]."*

**Supply Chain Reality:**
- Integrators assemble packages from sub-vendors; even "simple" pumps are sold as complete packages
- Operators buy packages, don't specify manufacturing method
- One integrator partnership = access to entire operator customer base
- Operators are **reactive** on technology: *"The company should go to them and should sell them capabilities"*

**Boom/Bust Cycle Dynamics:**
- **Boom:** *"Cost doesn't matter, just get parts fast"* — AM value = speed
- **Bust:** *"Optimize costs, reduce inventory"* — AM value = cost reduction
- Value proposition must work in **both** phases

---

### 3.7 Québec Digital Transformation Gap

**Finding (Fanny Charreteur, PRIMA Québec Survey):** Canadian advanced materials companies face a significant digital adoption lag.

**PRIMA Québec Survey Data (39 responses from 146 organizations):**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Interest in new technologies | Nearly 100% |
| Adopted new tech in past 5 years | Majority |
| Adopted digital tools | 77% |
| Adopted AI/ML technologies | 60% |
| **Investment cost** as barrier | **89%** |
| **ROI uncertainty** as barrier | **55%** |
| Workforce shortages as barrier | 32% |
| Lack of support/guidance as barrier | 21% |
| Companies benefiting from Digital Transformation Offensive | ~20% of 619 |
| Direct AM companies in survey | 1 of 39 |

**Strategic Implication:** While interest is universal, the cost and ROI uncertainty barriers align with the working capital reframe — the pitch must lead with quantified ROI (15%+ per OMV requirement).

---

## 4. Competitive & Partnership Intelligence

### 4.1 Competitive Landscape

| Player | Focus | Stage | Threat Level | Strategy |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Canada Makes / Select AM** | Part identification for AM suitability | In development (not proven) | 🟡 Medium | Partner — complement, don't compete |
| **The Assembly Studio (PEI)** | Secure digital inventory (IP focus) | 4 months old, pilot | 🟢 Low (complementary) | Partnership — different segments |
| **Fieldnode** | SaaS digital inventory for O&G | Live (ConocoPhillips, Equinor, Shell, BP) | 🔴 HIGH | Differentiate on certification/AI |
| **Pelagus 3D** | Digital spare parts marketplace | Active but struggling with OEMs | 🟡 Medium | Exploit their OEM relationship weakness |
| **Atlantic XL** | Metal AM for offshore oil | Active (expensive) | 🟡 Medium | Potential consortium member |
| **Baker Hughes (Germany)** | Digital inventory for O&G; 450+ qualified AM parts | Operational in Europe | 🔴 High (if enters Canada) | Canadian differentiation |
| **NGen AI Mapping Tool** | Value chain mapping | 65% accuracy (too low) | 🟢 Low | Contribute AI expertise |
| **Engineered Intelligence** | AI asset intelligence for utilities | Active development | 🟢 Low (partner) | Integrate digital inventory |

### 4.2 Partnership Strategy

**Priority Partners:**
1. **Canada Makes** — Integrate with Select AM tool; position as "next layer"
2. **The Assembly Studio** — Customer referrals (they take general mfg, we take offshore); co-content
3. **NGen** — Amplification channel; Hannover Messe 2026 booth ($2K)
4. **Engineered Intelligence (Adam Chubbs)** — AI asset intelligence + digital inventory = closed loop
5. **ERINL** — Funding for DNV/Lloyd's certification costs
