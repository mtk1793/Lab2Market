## Interview Questions (6-7 Core Questions)

### 1. Origin Story & Customer Discovery Journey (3-4 minutes)

**I'm really curious about your journey with The Assembly Studio. As someone who's successfully built a digital inventory business, what surprised you most about customer needs when you first started?**

- *Probe:* Was there a specific "aha moment" when you realized this was a viable business?
- *Probe:* How different were customer pain points from what you initially expected?

---

### 2. Customer Adoption Patterns & Metrics (5-6 minutes)

**I'm trying to understand the customer adoption curve for digital inventory. From your experience, roughly what percentage of companies you speak with are:**
   - **Already looking for digital inventory solutions** (they know they need it)
   - **Open to the idea once they hear about it** (can be convinced)
   - **Not ready yet** (too early, budget constraints, etc.)

- *Probe:* What patterns have you noticed in companies that adopt quickly versus those who need 6-12 months?
- *Probe:* Roughly how long is your typical sales cycle from first contact to first production?

---

### 3. Common Metrics & Business Case (5-6 minutes)

**When companies evaluate digital inventory, what metrics do they care about most? Are they looking at:**
   - **Cost savings** (warehousing, working capital)?
   - **Lead time reduction**?
   - **Supply chain resilience**?

- *Probe:* Do you have any ballpark numbers you can share? For example, what's a typical warehousing cost reduction or lead time improvement customers see?
- *Probe:* What ROI threshold do customers typically need to see before they commit?

**For market sizing purposes, I'm curious: roughly how many parts per year does a typical customer produce through your digital inventory system?**

- *Probe:* What's the range—smallest customer vs. largest customer in terms of annual part volume?
- *Probe:* What's a typical customer lifetime value if you're comfortable sharing a ballpark?

---

### 4. Part Categories & Segmentation (4-5 minutes)

**I'm interested in understanding which types of parts work best for digital inventory. From your experience, are there certain product categories or part characteristics that are:**
   - **Ideal candidates** (high adoption, few issues)
   - **Moderate fit** (work but require more customer education)
   - **Not a good fit** (too complex, certification issues, etc.)

- *Probe:* Have you noticed any patterns around part complexity, volume, or material requirements?
- *Probe:* What percentage of a typical customer's inventory can realistically be converted to digital?

---

### 5. Barriers & Objections You've Overcome (4-5 minutes)

**I keep hearing about certification as a major barrier in my research, especially for marine and offshore industries. How have you approached this challenge?**

- *Probe:* What percentage of your customers require certified parts versus non-certified?
- *Probe:* Have you found workarounds or partnerships that help with the certification issue?

**Beyond certification, what other objections come up most frequently, and how do you address them?**

- *Probe:* Is it trust in quality? IP protection concerns? Cost?

---

### 6. Growth Opportunities & Market Sizing (3-4 minutes)

**From your perspective as someone in the trenches, which industries or market segments do you see as having the most untapped potential for digital inventory in Canada?**

- *Probe:* Are there sectors you've intentionally chosen NOT to focus on (where someone else could fill the gap)?
- *Probe:* What would need to change to unlock those markets?

**Roughly speaking, how many companies in Canada do you think could potentially benefit from digital inventory?**

- *Probe:* Of those, what percentage do you think are actually reachable/serviceable in the next 3-5 years?
- *Probe:* For offshore/marine specifically, do you have a sense of how many companies might need these solutions?

---

### 7. Lessons Learned & Advice (2-3 minutes)

**If you were advising someone like me—a researcher exploring digital inventory for offshore/marine applications—what's the one thing you'd tell me to focus on or avoid?**

- *Probe:* What's something you wish you'd known earlier that would have saved you time?
- *Probe:* Are there any strategic partnerships or ecosystem relationships that were game-changers for you?

---

### Optional Follow-Up (if time allows):

**Is there anyone in the offshore energy, defense, or marine sectors you'd recommend I connect with who might benefit from digital inventory solutions?**
