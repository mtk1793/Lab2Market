Hello, hey, good morning good morning, morning. How are you? [...1.5s] Can't hear, cause I've got, I've got some audio issues. Can you hear me?Okay yeah yeah, I can hear you, that's fantastic. Okay, I can't hear you, so you can't hear me. Oh, just wait, just give me a minute. Uh, [...1.5s] I do have, my microphone is working from my side. [...1.5s] Okay, [...0.8s] can you hear me now?Yep, we're good, yeah, fantastic, fantastic. How's everything? Good, how are you? Yeah, not bad about life, yeah, [...0.5s] excellent.Yeah, it's nice to meet you. I appreciate the introduction to grassy. Yeah, yeah, he was such a nice guy. I mean, I met him at the gym, and after I found out he's working on the project, and the same project, that [...0.7s] not the same project, the concept that he's working on is the same. And after I had a little bit talk chitchat with him, and he told me that there's another fantastic guy named Jordan.You do like me to connect with us that, yeah, why not? Right now I'm trying to get information as much as possible from different, yeah, sure, [...0.5s] yep, so a little bit of introduction about myself and my works. Then [...1.2s] if you don't mind, you can just introduce yourself a little bit more.Absolutely, yeah, perfect. Just in case, would that be okay if I record this call? It's for the research purposes. Yep, you're [...1.1s] good to go. Yeah, so my name is Matthew Kiasi. I'm doing my PhD at Dalhousie University right now.Around 2 years ago, [...0.5s] me and industrial partner, we came up with an idea to work on additive manufacturing and digital inventory. So recently that our kind of idea was big enough to be accepted in one of the programs that we called as lab to market.So in this program that is a national program in Canada itself, that we as some kind of concert as a young entrepreneur, we have to talk with so many peoples at least around hundred interviews [...0.5s] to validate.Yeah, that's a lot, have to talk with lots of people, and then we have to validate our some kind of idea to see that if it's going to be acceptable for the market or not. Because right now the idea is good, but yet it's in the raw phase form, so I'm trying to gather more knowledge about it.Yeah, that's why I'm trying to find expertise people like you to help in order to see that what kind of aspects or what kind of this idea have to be developed, or maybe I have to pee that and so on and so forth.That was a little bit about myself [...0.7s] at, if you let me at the end of my questions, because I prepared a couple of questions that I would like to ask. Oh, cool. Okay, at the end of that, I would talk a little bit more about the whole project itself.Sure, but right now let's hear from you, enough of me, [...0.6s] yeah, yeah, absolutely, so again, uh, my name is Jordan coming. I've, I've mostly worked in the, um, ocean technology sector for, you know, it's, it's gotta be over 10 years [...0.9s] now. I started more on the technical side of things.I used to work offshore for a number of years on a remotely operated [...0.9s] vehicles, [...0.8s] so, you know, subsea tethered vehicles that would [...0.7s] go down about, you know, anywhere between 1,000 to 3,000 meters depth, um, and inspect and manipulate a whole bunch of underwater assets.Um you know, I'm more or less supported in [...0.6s] offshore natural, um, gas refinery just, just here off the coast of the Nova Scotia.So I, you know, my I, you know, I went through Memorial University through that, through the Marine Institute over in Newfoundland, um, so worked offshore for a number of years, but then transitioned into [...0.7s] on shore work.And I worked with a company, um, that more or less did [...0.6s] subsea communications systems, so [...0.5s] essentially be a comms hub [...0.5s] to run a bunch of different subsidi devices, whether it's underwater cameras, lights, sonar systems, hydrophones, that sort of thing on, um, [...1.4s] see bed observatory platforms, listening platforms, [...0.5s] ROVs, because ROVs use that too.So, so I was [...0.9s] more or less a hands on kind of technical guy. Service, service technician ended up being production manager. Um, we were a small team.Um, when, when I first joined back in 2016, but then our startup company was acquired by a much larger Ocean Tech company.So I did that for, [...0.6s] I'd say about seven years, and then I kind of [...0.6s] took myself out of that role and entered more of a technical sales support role. So, so that was actually with crack and robotics.Um, [...0.5s] if you've heard of those guys before, yeah, yeah, and then, you know, the rest is essentially history. You know, I've joined an ingenuity. Um, I've been with them for over [...0.5s] two years. Um, now, um, still very much involved in a, in a lot of ocean technology projects.And, you know, what's, what's great about what you're working on right now is that it does have a substantial amount of credibility behind it because [...0.6s] this kind of thing is what certain organizations on a large scale are looking into right now.In fact, like ingenuity has been involved with this sort of additive manufacturing project before and one of the, one of the points to highlight and investigate further was, you know, assembling and maintaining a digital library of, of parts.Yeah, [...1.2s] so it certainly has value. Um, [...0.6s] there's actually [...0.6s] have, have you, um, have you been connected with [...0.6s] the Cove over in Dartmouth, the center for Ocean Ventures and entrepreneurship [...0.8s] of [...0.5s] the Cove?Yeah, Cove haven't been connected to it. I mean, I sent a couple of emails to a couple of people there and I do have Cove in the LinkedIn, but no specific person, not for Chelsea.I mean okay, [...0.7s] and the reason I bring it up is that they've, they partnered with, um, Tallis who, who supports the, um, offshore [...0.5s] Arctic Patrol Vessel program with the Canadian Navy.So they've been in charge [...0.5s] of a lot of unique upgrade projects, but they join Cove on a challenge program. Um, and, and one of them was [...0.5s] additive manufacturing. So there were companies that applied to be part of that project.And it, I guess it, kind of, has a similar model to, um, to what you guys do [...0.6s] in terms of lap to market. Um, just a slightly different angle. But it's very much focused on, [...0.9s] um you know, [...0.5s] additive manufacturing and exotic materials or 3D printing of metals and plastics, [...0.5s] um, [...1.7s] which is great.But then more, I guess, needs to be accounted for. And part of it is the digital library, which, you know, there, there [...1.1s] they're, kind of, [...0.6s] at the beginning of, of this challenge.I'm not sure what kind of lessons they've Learned thus far, and, kind of, developing a model for this. Um, but after this call, I think I can dig through my contacts and, and [...0.5s] find the right person at Allison. Maybe [...0.5s] you can interview them as well.Yeah, actually I was going to ask you at the end of that, I mean, at the end of each interview, because if you can't find one right person, it can lead you to another right people, right, that's what absolutely people to find to some kind of use reference and use, use them as a reference to refer me to introduce me, like, the thing that the seeded with you, so that is fantastic.I mean, that's how I'm trying to build the connections, build networking and understanding.Yeah, perfect. So thank you very much for all of the information. I actually, I love them because [...0.5s] during the past interviews, it was [...0.5s] a little bit bumpy road. I mean, some people said, right, okay, this is good.Some people said that, no, you have to change your way a little bit, not that much. I mean, most of them, they liked it.Some of them, they told it from their perspective. I don't know if I guess in your industry, you know, Mark Kirby, [...0.8s] have you heard about name sounds familiar. Yeah, you actually, yeah, you, you wasn't such a nice guy. I found it, uh, from another company, I was, uh, with [...0.6s] engine company.I had an interview with them, oh yes, okay yeah yeah, engine Mr Default, Defalco, I guess Frank, yeah, he introduced me there to Mark Kirby.He told me that Mark Kirby is a genius of this section. And I talked with him, he was such a nice guy. He told me that good, some kind of good thing that I have to focus on.Okay, so again thank you very much for the introduction parts. Let's talk a little bit about my questions because this is the [...0.5s] main part of each interview, obviously, so since you're working, it's a, in some kind of the offshore, which is, I love it. This lap to market as the main part is about the offshore, mostly oil and gas.So I was talking with a couple of industry people and they do have, I can say it's still not accepted additive manufacturing the way that it should be. I mean, right?Yeah, but recently I was talking with the big industry and the guy told me that, okay, right now we do have vessels and these vessels are worth 500 million to one billion dollars right now in our physical inventory, we do have more than 50 million dollars just stock. Maybe they're not using that, but they're just there.And after that I was talking with two peoples, one professor from the out to Udelhaus University and he told me that apparently right now the editive manufacturing or most of its focus, it's on non structural, some kind of parts rather than structural.So how do you think this additive manufacturing is going to fit inside this market and how acceptable it would be rather despite of the fact that it would be structural or non structural, [...0.7s] yeah, the way I've always, [...0.6s] you know, kind kind of seen it. Um.And I guess there [...0.5s] might be some reinforcement to credibility just from what we've seen of people using out of manufacturing and in real time.It's, I, I would say it would be less on the structural and more on, um, components that support [...0.7s] certain subsystems on, on a vessel so if you have piping infrastructure [...0.5s] for your fresh water on, on a, on a ship that, that people can use, [...0.6s] you know, every day, it, you know, whether it's [...1.0s] low valves [...1.4s] or piping joints, that's that sort of thing. [...1.1s]There's also, you know, when something happens offshore, you know, there's some sort of technical emergency, [...0.5s] you know, a component breaks in a piece of equipment, you know, you might be running generators [...1.0s] on, [...0.5s] on your ship, and there's a mechanical part that failed.Obviously, you can't, [...0.9s] you know, if you don't have inventory of, of that, which obviously you, you wouldn't.If it's specialized, you know, there's not readily available spares, just kicking around in the boiler room. Um, you, you would essentially have to steam back to port and then order in the replacement, wait for the parts to get here, and then make your repairs.But if you have access to, [...0.8s] you know, being able to design on the fly, or you have a parts library inventory of, of major components, and it's just a matter of going through that digital inventory, clicking print, and then you're still waiting, but you're not waiting as long, and then you can make the repair right on the fly at sea.So it's, I would say it's less [...0.5s] structural and more like component level. But as, you know, as you know, we see an advancement in that kind of technology, especially for, [...0.5s] um, 3D printing of, of various metals.We actually might see, [...0.5s] you know, structure support pieces that, that would, kind of, feed feed into that perfect. That's fantastic. Uh, part of your, uh, some kind of, actually the whole idea of my work is some kind of like this.I mean, I'm trying to find a way in order to connect the people either somehow I cannot convince them, obviously, I doubt, uh, propose them to have those 3D printing facility by themselves on site, or if they don't have, at least try to try to connect them with their closest one. As you just mentioned, if someone needs, try to order as fast. Uh.And I'm trying to refer to one of my some kind of interviews because I found that it would be beneficial if I have some kind of backup for myself. And he said that, okay, this guy [...0.7s] had some kind of experience.I was working with one of the people and he indirectly mentioned something [...0.7s] about the regulation. I mean, actually he talked a lot about the regulation. We do have a problem with that.All of them almost all of them mentioned that the one of the reasons that additive manufacturing cannot move that fast is because of the regulation. So it makes sense, right? I mean, if you just produce a part, you have to make sure it's completely identical with the fabrication, with the solution.So, [...0.8s] and after that, an idea came up to my mind. I'm not sure how into how much is it right?For instance, as you mention, imagine a story that we do have a problem with one of the parts, and obviously, if you want to order that, it takes a lot of fix, and each day in oil and gas industry means millions of dollars.Yeah, dang downtime absolutely, yeah, exactly. Can we consider at this stage, maybe in the future stage, it would be another story.Can we consider additive manufacturing as a temporary solution right now and say that, okay, for instance, you have a problem, I can make something be additive manufacturing to make your work a little bit better until you wait for that part.Or no, you think that either it's 0 or one, either I have to have a solution or no temporary solution. How do you think about this concept? I mean, it just clicked in my mind. I'm not sure how true is that, but [...0.8s] what do you think about that?I, I think the concept, um, [...0.5s] has, has value depending on the application and situation that you're in. I mean, you know there have been plenty of times, even in my personal experience, where, you know, the ROV system that I was working on is [...0.5s] both has hydraulic and electrical components to it.On the hydraulic side, I mean, you have a lot of tubing, you have a lot of fittings, you have a lot of flow control valves, um, [...0.7s] our spare parts inventory for that system is limited.So, you know, the more, the more you use those parts over time, if you're not keeping track of your inventory as your quantity, [...0.5s] um, kind of gets lower and it's not replenished sooner or later, you're gonna run out of something.So even, you know, time you know, the small little Swayze lock fittings or threads or knots in that sort of thing, I mean, [...0.5s] there are times where, when the system is down and every second counts to get it back in the water, yeah, right? Or else it's money lost.Sometimes you do have to, you know, kind of do on the fly, sort of Macgyver engineering.The question is, you know, and you, you mentioned you brought this up is, you know, if that part were to be, [...0.6s] you know, a temporary solution in terms of its, it's an [...0.5s] additive manufactured piece as a temporary replacement until you get the real parts in. In terms of performance, [...0.5s] um, to get to simply get the job done. I'm, I'm sure there's credibility there.The question is, is it going to hold up to the same level, say, if it's a hydraulic fitting, is it going to have the exact same pressure rating with the safety factor on there?Is it certified for [...1.0s] against like marine grade kind of corrosion? And, and then and then, you know, because it's technically not from a known source, there's also a liability issue, so [...0.8s] it's a bit of a gray area.Um, and again, I think it's one of those things where we need to kind of put that theory into practice and get the [...0.5s] feedback, yeah, um, [...0.5s] and then there's nothing.The other thing too is, you know, [...0.5s] again depending on what the part is and where it's being installed, there are certain levels of certification and, um, harsh [...1.3s] environmental testing certifications that [...0.5s] it needs to comply with.That might be a bit harder in terms of the standard that's already set. If it's more or less like an exotic material, [...0.5s] um, so it, there would also need to be a vetting process [...0.6s] beforehand, [...1.6s] you know, to to the point where you're transitioning to having that [...0.7s] access offshore. If, if that makes any sense.But I think we're I think we're I think we're slowly getting there. I think there's a lot more people that are open to it, which is why this has been something that a lot of the tier 2, tier 1 suppliers to our, you know, Canadian Navy, for example, are, are investigating this and taking it seriously.Okay, okay, perfect. Yeah, I have to find my way through them to see that what's going on with them and see what's, what is happening in the future [...0.8s] in part of your some kind of, I only have two more questions.Sorry, now I'm not configured with my, no worries. So, uh, in part of your question, uh, in, uh, your, the answer you are talking about the inventory actually, uh, part of my work is also about the digital inventory.Yeah, fantastic. Yeah, I mean I heard so many good things about that. I mean with I talked with lots of people and apparently the main bottleneck for them right now is about how they can control the inventory, either it's physical or some kind of shifted toward the digital.I mean, obviously we cannot shift completely to digital, they still need some kind of parts, but that's a good transition yet I'm trying to find my way in it. So you mentioned about the track of inventory, [...0.8s] obviously, uh, it doesn't matter.It's about the inventory or it's about maybe corrosion or any, any problem in the whole process of additive manufacturing technology has a great, [...0.5s] I believe at this position over here, it doesn't matter to normal or traditional technology using the sensors or any other idea or using the new ones that we know it as AI.So I talked with a couple of people and they told me that yes, AI is good, yet we don't know at what aspect we can use it or sure, just using it in a very, very [...1.2s] limited amount of [...0.5s] some kind of part of their porch.How do you some kind of predict the future of integrating AI? Because again, [...0.6s] well, most of my PhD work on electrical engineer, but most of my PSG short AI.How some kind of optimistic you are about integration of AI or any other kind of technology like that into additive manufacturing and digital elementary.Yeah, that's a, that's a great question. I think we're already seeing it, to be honest with you. I mean, there's I'll, I'll have to get the name, but I came, came across a website [...0.5s] that has, um, [...0.8s] AI software that's used as more or less, uh, mechanical design engineering assistant.So, um, if you, let's say you were to model, um, some sort of part in, you know, an whether it's Autocad, um, inventor, some type of mechanical 3D modeling software for engineering, um, purposes. [...1.1s]Um, [...0.7s] the AI tool in theory, cause I haven't used, it would more or less make [...0.6s] some recommendations towards your design in terms of performance, um, especially if [...0.5s] part of your inputs in, in modeling your part.You mentioned that you're using a different type of plastic, um, printed aluminum, that sort of thing.I think, you know, as we go on, [...0.6s] um, the use of AI will be a lot cleaner. Um, if there's still, there's still a bit of challenges there, there are still, you know, kind of follow UPS that, [...0.6s] that [...0.6s] AI seems to, [...0.5s] kind of, capture if you're not even putting in the correct prompts.So, so there's that level of correctiveness that still needs to be kind of, you know sifted through. But I, I think we're, [...0.5s] we're pretty, we're a lot closer than I think a lot of people realize.And I and and again, you know, AI is such a huge, you know, even buzzword in the industry and people are really doing their due diligence to see how it can benefit their organization, their application. But also I think people are being a lot more careful about how to use it properly.Exactly. So, yeah, absolutely, I think there's a lot of potential there. That makes sense.Okay, okay, perfect. I like all of the answers that they here today. It was, it was such a great meeting for me. To be honest, I only have two, kind of maybe two or three favors. I mean, at the end of each meeting I do have that one.So the very first favor was about the connection because you mention that [...0.8s] you are probably going to find someone from Cove to, I'm sorry, Tallis, I guess that was the name.Yeah, I, the tallest would probably be [...1.1s] a great option. And then there's another manufacturer, local manufacturer, if you haven't spoken to them already, precise design, [...0.7s] um, they'd be able to.There's a few contacts I have in mind that might be able to have some conversations with you on this very thing. Perfect.Fantastic. That would be great. And also you mentioned about the crack and robotics. Uh, I mean do you think it's valuable to talk with them as well? I mean, I sent a couple of emails to them, but still not a chance to talk with them.I mean, [...0.8s] yeah it's I, it's it's a little bit difficult. They, I mean, they are just they are so busy and cannot get out of their own way with a bunch of different projects.So it would, I would have to kind of, that would probably be third on the priority list because I would have to nail down the right person that actually has [...0.5s] the time and the expertise, you know, just because I'm sure it's something they considered before, but it's, it's not necessarily much, you know, as much of a focus as it is for Talis and precise design and, and other folks like that. So I'll dig up some contacts for you.That's fantastic, fantastic. And final last favor is that, uh, in this program just after market, we do have the mentor, we do have facilitators, someone taking care of us. And all the time they said that, uh, you are a toddler, you are right now at the learning phase. It means that in the future, always you are going to gain more knowledge.So I really would like to keep this connection with you and maybe say in a couple of months later, I said that, hey, Jordan, I came up with an idea and right now I'm trying to look at this kind of concept from another perspective. Would that be sure to have another kind of concept?Absolutely, absolutely great. Yeah, I just wanna heard about that. Perfect, perfect. Thank you very much for the timing, and I'm waiting for your contact list. Okay, we'll be in touch. Thank you so much. Really enjoy the conversation. Have a good day. Take care. Bye. You too.
