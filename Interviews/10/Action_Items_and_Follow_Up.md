**Interview Date:** February 3, 2026  
**Interviewee:** Jordan Cumming  
**Key Topics:** Digital inventory skepticism, AM limitations, business case barriers, AI potential

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS FROM END OF INTERVIEW

### **1. CREATE LINKEDIN POST (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

#### **What Jordan Requested:**

> "Please, please, please. Why don't you do a post on LinkedIn where you say had a great conversation with Mark Kirby [Jordan], about digital inventory. I suggest don't post it as a comment to the thread we've already got going cause it'll get lost in the noise. **Create a new post.** I looked at you on LinkedIn you're a little bit difficult to figure out because you're sort of... maybe that's deliberate, but do a post, tag me in it and I'll respond back."

#### **Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Jordan will respond publicly → exposes your work to his network
- ✅ More cost-effective than 1:1 outreach ("a lot easier than you should talk to someone")
- ✅ Brings people to you instead of chasing them
- 🚨 **Jordan explicitly said "PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE"** → This is critical for him to help you

#### **Action Required:**
- [ ] Create NEW LinkedIn post (not comment on existing thread)
- [ ] Tag Jordan Cumming
- [ ] Mention "had a great conversation about digital inventory"
- [ ] Jordan will respond → network effect

---

### **2. CONTACT POLYUNITY (IMMEDIATE)**

#### **What Jordan Said:**

> "Polyunity is probably the best example of that, how they're doing it. And they're working within a regulated environment. So I'm sure you, if you haven't talked to Stephen Ryan or somebody from there, you will."

#### **Why Critical:**
- ✅ **Best example** of digital inventory in practice (medical AM)
- ✅ Regulated environment (certification insights)
- ✅ Remote communities use case (Newfoundland + remote hospitals)
- ✅ Jordan independently recommended (Mark Kirby also recommended in Interview 9!)

#### **Contact:** Stephen Ryan @ Polyunity

#### **Action Required:**
- [ ] Email Jacqueline @ Polyunity (already have contact from Hopkins mentor meeting)
- [ ] Mention Jordan Cumming recommended them as "best example"
- [ ] Ask about digital warehouse pivot, regulated environment, remote delivery

---

### **3. CONTACT ATLANTIC IQ (AI + SHIPBUILDING)**

#### **What Jordan Said:**

> "There's a company I was talking to today, Atlantic IQ... they're looking at AI with shipbuilding doing some amazing work that are definitely trying to... they're in Newfoundland. The RMD is, I forget his name anyway. The marketing guy is somebody called Bone... doing some really good stuff where they're looking at requirements for ships and using AI to figure out when requirements aren't properly being met."

#### **Why Important:**
- ✅ AI application in manufacturing (your PhD focus)
- ✅ Requirements management = similar to your "signals" problem
- ✅ Newfoundland-based (Hopkins connection possible)
- ✅ Complexity management (ships = thousands of parts, like digital inventory)

#### **Contact:**
- **Company:** Atlantic IQ (Newfoundland)
- **Marketing Contact:** "Bone" (surname)
- **RMD:** (Need to identify - likely "Research & Market Development")

#### **Action Required:**
- [ ] Research Atlantic IQ company (website, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Identify "Bone" surname contact
- [ ] Email introduction mentioning Jordan Cumming reference
- [ ] Ask about AI requirements management for ships

---

### **4. REACH OUT TO NICOLE (AI FOR MANUFACTURING CANADA)**

#### **What Jordan Said:**

> "The conversation Nicole heads up AI for manufacturing, and again it's a sort of, it's got giants in it, like Siemens..."

#### **Why Important:**
- ✅ AI for Manufacturing Canada = national initiative
- ✅ Giants like Siemens involved (credibility + resources)
- ✅ Directly aligned with your AI + manufacturing focus
- ✅ Frank DeFalco already offered to introduce you to Nicole!

#### **Action Required:**
- [ ] Follow up with Frank DeFalco for Nicole introduction (he promised this)
- [ ] Prepare questions about AI in inventory management
- [ ] Ask about Siemens partnership opportunities

---

### **5. FOCUS ON "SIGNAL PROCESSING" PIVOT**

#### **What Jordan Said:**

> "One of the reasons planning is bad is our signals are bad. So I would be trying to focus on, if you like, **signal processing**, and how can AI help with clearer communication?"

#### **Strategic Pivot:**
❌ **DON'T:** "We connect ecosystems" (Jordan called this "snake oil salesmen")  
✅ **DO:** "We improve signals for better planning decisions"

#### **Action Required:**
- [ ] Reframe value proposition from "ecosystem connection" to "signal clarity"
- [ ] Focus on: Why is planning bad? Because signals are bad
- [ ] AI role: Process ambiguous data → clear actionable insights

---

### **6. "FOLLOW THE MONEY" TOOL (NEW HYPOTHESIS)**

#### **What Jordan Said:**

> "I think if you could follow the money, you will actually expose the real supply chains. They typically know their first tier suppliers, but they don't know the second tier, the third tier. And that's where the wheels can fall off when they need something."

#### **New Hypothesis - H58: "Follow the Money" Supply Chain Mapping**

**Hypothesis:** Companies don't know their tier 2/3 suppliers, which causes supply chain failures. A tool that maps financial flows would reveal hidden supply chain dependencies and predict failure points.

#### **Action Required:**
- [ ] Add H58 to hypothesis tracking
- [ ] Research financial data access (likely "not totally legal" per Jordan)
- [ ] Alternative: Transaction volume analysis (anonymized)
- [ ] Interview procurement teams about tier 2/3 visibility gaps

---

### **7. IDENTIFY THE "RIGHT 5%" TOOL (CANADA MAKES ALIGNMENT)**

#### **What Jordan Said:**

> "If it was a great solution for 5% of the inventory problem, that's still worth solving. But you just have to recognise it's a 5% solution and you have to be really good at **what is the right 5%** and most people are not good at that. Maybe there's help in some tools there. **What are the right parts to print?** And again, that's something **Canada Makes is trying to help with**."

#### **Strategic Alignment:**
- ✅ Canada Makes Select AM tool = identifies AM candidates
- ✅ Your tool = business case calculator for the "right 5%"
- 🤝 Partnership opportunity (don't compete)

#### **Action Required:**
- [ ] Research Canada Makes Select AM tool capabilities
- [ ] Contact Mark Kirby (Canada Makes consultant) for collaboration discussion
- [ ] Position as enhancement: "Select AM identifies candidates → We prove ROI for the right 5%"

## 📧 FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TEMPLATE

### **Email Subject:** Following Up - Digital Inventory Discussion & LinkedIn Post

---

**Email Body:**

Hi Jordan,

Thank you so much for the incredibly insightful conversation earlier today. Your perspectives on digital inventory, AM limitations, and the "signal processing" framing have fundamentally shaped how I'm thinking about this problem.

**Three immediate follow-ups:**

**1. LinkedIn Post (as you requested)**  
I'm drafting a LinkedIn post about our conversation and will tag you. As you suggested, I'll create a **new post** (not comment on the existing thread) to maximize visibility. I'll mention:
- Your challenge to the "AM enables digital inventory" assumption
- The "signal processing" insight (planning is bad because signals are bad)
- The "right 5%" framing (be excellent at identifying which inventory problems AM actually solves)

I'll post this by [DATE] and tag you for your response. Thank you for offering to help amplify this!

**2. Polyunity & Atlantic IQ Follow-Up**  
Per your recommendations, I'm reaching out to:
- **Polyunity** (Stephen Ryan) - you called them "probably the best example" of digital inventory in a regulated environment
- **Atlantic IQ** - the AI + shipbuilding requirements management work sounds directly relevant to the "signals" problem

If you have specific contact details for either, I'd appreciate it. Otherwise, I'll track them down through LinkedIn/company websites.

**3. Nicole (AI for Manufacturing Canada)**  
I'm following up with Frank DeFalco for an introduction to Nicole. The AI for Manufacturing initiative (with Siemens and other giants) seems like a perfect alignment for validating the AI inventory optimization angle.

**Key Takeaways I'm Acting On:**

✅ **Reframe from "ecosystem connection" to "signal processing"**  
   - You're right that "bringing everybody together" sounds like snake oil  
   - Focus: Why planning fails → bad signals → AI-powered clarity

✅ **Partner with Canada Makes, don't compete**  
   - Their Select AM tool identifies candidates  
   - My business case calculator enhances it (the "right 5%" problem)

✅ **"Follow the money" for tier 2/3 supplier mapping**  
   - This is a gap companies don't even know they have  
   - Alternative approaches needed (since literal financial tracking isn't feasible)

✅ **Accept AM = 5% solution (but that's still valuable!)**  
   - Stop overpromising "print on demand"  
   - Be excellent at identifying the right 5%

**Request:**  
As I conduct more interviews (working toward 100 for Lab2Market), would you be open to a quick 15-minute follow-up in 3-4 weeks? I'd love to share:
- Findings from Polyunity, Atlantic IQ, Nicole conversations
- Refined value proposition based on "signal processing" framing
- Early prototype/mockup of the "right 5%" identification tool

No pressure if timing doesn't work - but I found your feedback incredibly valuable and would love to pressure-test the pivot with you once I've made progress.

Thank you again for your time and candor. Looking forward to staying connected!

Best regards,  
Mahmoud Kiasari

## 📊 HYPOTHESIS UPDATES FROM INTERVIEW

### **❌ CHALLENGED/REJECTED:**

#### **NH.9 - AM Enables Digital Inventory**

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "I'm not convinced that additive enables digital inventory. In fact, I don't think that it does. There is nothing I have ever printed in metal that did not require machining as well. So why didn't I just take a block and machine it from solid?"

**Status:** ❌ **REJECTED** (same as Mark Kirby Interview 9)

**Implication:** Digital inventory ≠ AM-specific. CAD + CNC already enabled it 10 years ago.

---

### **✅ VALIDATED:**

#### **H50/H54 - Business Case Calculator Priority**

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "I think the answer is easier. It's around the business case. There isn't a strong enough business case typically where additive is out and out the clear winner."

**Status:** ✅ **CRITICAL VALIDATION**

**Evidence:**
- Business case biggest barrier (not certification)
- Medical device example: 3x cost but savings in different budget
- Aerospace: Save $5M fuel over lifetime, but nobody writes that check upfront

---

#### **NH.7 - Certification as Barrier**

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "Certification is a significant barrier to adoption because we keep regarding additive as a novel process. It needs extra layers added on top, which come with cost and time burden."

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED**

**Evidence:**
- Extra qualification layers vs machining/welding (understood processes)
- Cost + time burden erodes AM attractiveness

---

#### **NH.4 - Geographic Isolation Drives Adoption**

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "The ability for additive to provide a solution to remote communities. 100% is one of the benefit. Polyunity is probably the best example... working within a regulated environment."

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED**

**Evidence:**
- Remote communities = AM on-ramp ("opposite of a barrier")
- Wartime vs peacetime footing (urgency enables adoption)
- $1M/day oil rig downtime scenario

---

#### **NH.5 - AI for Inventory Optimization**

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "Absolutely see a use for it. Why if we got inventory? We said it's just in case. Don't we think that AI could tell us with a little bit more certainty whether I'm really gonna need that component or not?"

**Status:** ✅ **CONCEPTUALLY VALIDATED** ⚠️ (but no proof yet)

**Evidence:**
- AI can ingest usage data, revisit stock levels
- Humans bad at planning → AI could help with scenarios
- **BUT:** "I've yet to see AI actually helping somebody take a huge warehouse and say you don't need any of this stuff"

---

### **🆕 NEW HYPOTHESES:**

#### **H58 - "Follow the Money" Tier 2/3 Supplier Mapping**

**Hypothesis:** Companies know tier 1 suppliers but not tier 2/3, which causes supply chain failures. A tool that maps deeper supply chain dependencies (via transaction analysis or other proxies) would predict failure points and enable risk mitigation.

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "If you could follow the money, you will actually expose the real supply chains. Companies typically know first tier suppliers, but they don't know second tier, third tier. And that's where the wheels can fall off."

**Validation Needed:** Interview procurement teams, supply chain managers

---

#### **H59 - Cross-Budget ROI Calculator**

**Hypothesis:** AM adoption fails when lifetime savings accrue to different budgets than upfront costs. A tool that maps ROI across organizational budgets would make hidden value visible to CFOs and enable cross-functional decision-making.

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "Medical is the best example... new device saves two hours operating theatre + two days hospital recovery. However, if device is 3x as expensive, and that budget comes out of somebody else's budget... then they'll do 3 times fewer operations every year."

**Evidence:**
- Medical: Device budget ≠ operating theatre budget ≠ hospital recovery budget
- Aerospace: Fuel savings over 30 years ≠ upfront purchase budget
- Space: Exception (charged by kilogram → immediate savings in same budget)

**Value:** Show CFO total organizational ROI, not siloed costs

## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS FROM JORDAN

### **1. DON'T BE A "SNAKE OIL SALESMAN"**

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "There are a lot of people... I won't include you in this group, but I'll call them snake oil salesman, where they're like 'oh, we're gonna bring everybody together and create the connections' and somehow there's value in this... I don't believe the print on demand. I don't believe there's much market there period."

**Warning:**
- ❌ Don't promise "ecosystem connection" as value prop
- ❌ Don't overhype "print on demand"
- ✅ Focus on tangible ROI: signal clarity, business case proof, tier 2/3 visibility

---

### **2. TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE ≠ MARKET DOMINANCE**

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "I worked for Renishaw before, amazing British company, amazing engineering prowess... we make the best machines, but we didn't achieve market dominance. They may well have the best machines, but they are not the No. 1 supplier. **Technical excellence doesn't guarantee market dominance.**"

**Implication:**
- Building best technology isn't enough
- Customer adoption > technical superiority
- Understand buyer psychology, risk aversion, procurement behavior

---

### **3. DUAL-SOURCING REALITY (HADRIAN EXAMPLE)**

**Jordan's Quote:**
> "My prediction would be that Hadrian's customers will dual source the work... they will promise Hadrian we're going to source these parts with you. And what they will do is source sort of 10% of the parts with Hadrian. They'll keep 90% with the existing supplier."

**Lesson:**
- Even amazing tech (Hadrian autonomous factories) won't get 100% adoption
- Customers hedge risk with dual-sourcing
- Success = grabbing that 10%, then growing it
- **Don't expect overnight market transformation**
