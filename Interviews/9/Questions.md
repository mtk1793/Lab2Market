## 🎯 Interview Objectives

1. **Digital Inventory Validation:** He recently posted asking "Why is digital inventory a new thing?" - understand his skepticism/curiosity
2. **Business Case Development:** He focuses on "evolving the business case for metal AM" - test H50 (risk categorization)
3. **Certification Expertise:** Aerospace/nuclear/medical background - validate NH.7 (certification gatekeeper)
4. **Reverse Engineering:** Tronosjet likely deals with obsolete aircraft parts - test H52
5. **Practitioner Validation:** Does our platform solve real problems for someone actually running AM operations?

## 🔑 Key Context

Mark is **NOT a theoretical expert** - he's in the trenches managing metal AM operations at Tronosjet (aerospace manufacturer). He has 7 years at Renishaw "de-risking AM for OEMs" and experience in aerospace, nuclear, and medical manufacturing certification. 

**Critical Insight:** He recently questioned whether digital inventory is genuinely new or just rebranded CAD management. This means he'll challenge our value prop - **which is exactly what we need** to refine our positioning.

## 📋 The 6 Critical Questions

### **1. You recently posted asking "We have CAD models, so why is digital inventory a new thing?" - what's the missing link that would make digital inventory actually valuable vs just CAD file management?**

**Why Critical:**
- **Direct challenge to our core value prop** (NH.9 - Digital inventory reduces lead time)
- Forces us to articulate differentiation beyond "storing STL files"
- His answer tells us what features matter to practitioners

**What to Listen For:**
- Does he mention certification metadata, material specs, process parameters?
- Is the gap about discoverability, qualification status, or integration with ordering?
- Does he see value or dismiss the entire concept?

---

### **2. At Tronosjet and Renishaw, what's been the biggest barrier to getting customers to move from AM prototyping to production parts?**

**Why Critical:**
- Tests NH.2 (Obsolescence driver), NH.7 (Certification gatekeeper), H50 (Risk categorization)
- Validates whether our "risk categorization tool" (H50) is actually the MVP feature
- Aerospace context is our target market

**What to Listen For:**
- Does he say "cost justification," "certification complexity," or "knowing which parts to try"?
- How important is the "which parts should I AM?" question vs "where do I find a facility?"
- Any mention of post-processing challenges (H51)?

---

### **3. When Tronosjet deals with obsolete aircraft parts, do you reverse engineer them or do OEMs provide digital files? What's the biggest bottleneck in that process?**

**Why Critical:**
- **Direct test of H52** (Reverse engineering integration)
- Tests NH.10 (OEM IP release blocker)
- Validates whether a "certification-ready digital library" is valuable

**What to Listen For:**
- Who owns the reverse engineering process - facility or customer?
- Is IP release the blocker, or is it scanning accuracy/certification approval?
- Would a marketplace of pre-scanned, qualification-ready parts be valuable?

---

### **4. For aerospace/medical manufacturers using your services, what percentage have their own certification/qualification expertise vs needing guidance on which standards apply?**

**Why Critical:**
- Tests VP.12 (Certification body decision support)
- Validates whether "certification complexity" is real or just perceived
- Tests whether a decision support tool would be used

**What to Listen For:**
- Do customers ask "which certification do I need?" or do they already know?
- Is AS9100, NADCAP, ISO13485 compliance the barrier or just paperwork?
- Would he pay for a tool that automates certification pathway selection?

---

### **5. Does Tronosjet currently struggle with any of these: (a) finding qualified post-processing partners for coatings/finishing, (b) managing which parts are certified vs experimental, (c) predicting lead times for customers?**

**Why Critical:**
- Tests H51 (Post-processing network), CP.6 (Paper-based chaos), NH.5 (Lead time predictability)
- Multi-hypothesis validation in one question
- Identifies which pain point is most acute for practitioners

**What to Listen For:**
- Which problem gets the strongest reaction?
- Does he have manual systems (Excel, emails) or sophisticated workflow tools?
- Is there a pain point we're missing entirely?

---

### **6. If there were a platform that: (a) helped manufacturers identify which parts are AM-suitable based on cost/complexity, (b) connected to certified facilities with real-time capacity, and (c) maintained certification metadata for digital part libraries - would this solve a problem you face, or is it a solution looking for a problem?**

**Why Critical:**
- **Forces honest feedback** on our entire value proposition
- Mark will call out BS - he's questioned digital inventory already
- Tests whether H50 (risk categorization) is the killer feature or just nice-to-have

**What to Listen For:**
- Does he immediately see value or ask skeptical questions?
- Which feature resonates most? (a = H50, b = CS.1, c = NH.9)
- Does he offer to pilot, dismiss entirely, or suggest a pivot?

## 🎯 Success Criteria for This Interview

✅ **Minimum Viable Success:**
- Understand why digital inventory hasn't taken off (refine positioning)
- Validate that certification complexity is real (NH.7)

✅ **Strong Success:**
- Confirm H50 (risk categorization) is MVP-worthy feature
- Identify 1-2 customers Tronosjet serves who might be early adopters
- Get honest feedback on platform differentiation

✅ **Exceptional Success:**
- Mark sees value and offers to pilot the platform at Tronosjet
- He validates that reverse engineering + certification integration is the missing link
- Introduction to aerospace OEMs or certification bodies he works with

---

## 📝 Post-Interview Actions

- [ ] Update hypothesis table with Mark's validation evidence
- [ ] Refine digital inventory positioning based on his feedback
- [ ] Research aerospace certification bodies he mentions
- [ ] Follow up on any customer referrals
- [ ] Revise H50 (risk categorization) if he identifies better framing

---

**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very High Priority)

**Why Mark Matters:** He's a **BS detector** with real operational experience. If he validates our value prop, it's credible. If he tears it apart, we learn what practitioners actually need vs what we think they need. Either outcome is valuable.
