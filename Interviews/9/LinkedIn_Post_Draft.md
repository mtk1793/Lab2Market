# LinkedIn Post Draft - Mark Kirby Interview

## Option 1: Professional & Insightful

---

**Had a fantastic conversation with Mark Kirby about digital inventory, AM adoption barriers, and the future of supply chain optimization.**

Mark challenged some of my core assumptions (in the best way possible!) and shared incredible insights about:

✅ Why business case > certification as the #1 barrier to AM adoption  
✅ The "signal processing" problem in modern supply chains  
✅ How to identify the "right 5%" of parts where AM actually delivers ROI  
✅ Why technical excellence ≠ market dominance

His 13 years in metal AM (Renishaw, Tronosjet, UWaterloo MSAM Lab) gave me practitioner-level reality checks that will fundamentally shape my research.

**Key takeaway:** "One of the reasons planning is bad is our signals are bad. Focus on how AI can help with clearer communication."

I'm conducting 100 customer discovery interviews for my PhD research on AI-powered supply chain platforms. If you're working on AM adoption, inventory optimization, or supply chain decision-making and want to share your perspective, I'd love to connect.

Thanks again, Mark, for the brutally honest and invaluable feedback! 🙏

## Option 2: More Casual & Provocative

---

**Just had my assumptions thoroughly challenged by Mark Kirby - and I couldn't be more grateful.**

Going into our conversation, I thought digital inventory was enabled by additive manufacturing. 

Mark's response: "I'm not convinced that additive enables digital inventory. In fact, I don't think that it does."

😅 Ouch. But also... exactly what I needed to hear.

After 13 years in metal AM at companies like Renishaw and now Tronosjet, Mark doesn't pull punches. Here's what he taught me:

**On business cases:** "The biggest barrier isn't certification - it's showing people the money. If benefits appear in different budgets (fuel savings, hospital time), nobody writes the upfront check."

**On market size:** "It isn't a billion dollar problem, it's a trillion dollar problem." (If we can solve 10% of global inventory waste)

** On realistic positioning:** "If it's a great solution for 5% of the inventory problem, that's still worth solving. But you have to be really good at identifying that 5%."

His recommendation? Stop focusing on "connecting ecosystems" (that already exists). Instead: **"Focus on signal processing - why is planning bad? Because our signals are bad."**

This one conversation may have saved me months of building the wrong product.

I'm doing 100 interviews for my PhD research on AI-powered supply chain platforms. If you work in AM, procurement, or inventory management and have 30 minutes to challenge my assumptions, please reach out!

Mark - thanks for the reality check. 🙏

## Option 3: Short & Direct (Highest Engagement Potential)

---

**"I don't believe additive manufacturing enables digital inventory."**

That's what Mark Kirby told me yesterday - and it might be the most valuable feedback I've received in my PhD research.

Why? Because I was about to build a platform positioned entirely around that assumption.

Mark has 13 years in metal AM (Renishaw → Tronosjet). His brutal honesty forced me to pivot from:

❌ "Digital inventory platform FOR additive manufacturing"

✅ "AI-powered supply chain signal processing platform that INCLUDES AM as one tool"

His best insight: **"The reason planning is bad? Our signals are bad. Focus on that."**

Doing 100 customer discovery interviews for my research. Who else wants to challenge my assumptions? 👇

## Recommendation:

**Use Option 3** - It's punchy, provocative, and Mark's quote is the hook. It shows vulnerability (admitting you were wrong) which drives engagement on LinkedIn.

**When to post:** Tag Mark using @Mark Kirby (or his actual LinkedIn handle if different)

**Why this works:**
- Opens with controversial quote (stops scrolling)
- Shows you're coachable (investors/partners value this)
- Specific value exchange (100 interviews = tangible ask)
- Short enough to read in 30 seconds

**What to expect:**
- Mark will likely comment/share (per his promise)
- His network will see the post
- You'll get inbound from AM practitioners who respect Mark's opinion
