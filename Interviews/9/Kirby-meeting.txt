Before starting that, could you just introduce yourself a little bit? I mean just very, very short, I mean short, yeah, Mark Kirby. Um, I've been working with, uh, Metal Attitude Manufacturing predominantly for about 13 years now started with running short.So my expertise, my deepest expertise is, [...0.5s] um, metal printing and specifically laser power bed fusion. Um, but I also work with engine, [...0.5s] um, and [...0.6s] I had a machine shop in the UK and I work for aerospace company and Pei, I will be doing machine as well as printing.So I'd like to think I'm agnostic to manufacturing processes. Um, so, yeah, happy to answer the questions that you have.Perfect. That's fantastic. Thank you very much. So [...0.7s] again, these are just around 5 to 6 questions that going to take that much for your time. So I would like to start a very first question with your latest post because you asked a question about [...0.6s] why we need the some kind of the digital inventory.I like the answers. I mean, some people's talk about the digital inventory is actually the whole process, not the normal digital inventory. Some of them talked about the right clients to their right manufacturing and digital highway, but one of them mentioned that, so what is your answer to your question? I really would like to know that.So I think the, [...0.6s] so just for the purpose of the interview, uh, I deliberately stated something that I hoped would be a little provocative, which was [...0.6s] we've been talking, people are talking about digital inventory as those, and you think, but [...0.5s] isn't it fundamentally enabled by cab models [...0.6s] and by, [...0.5s] um, sit by CNC?I would say as a method of manufacture? So we have a digital model, [...0.7s] and, um, we have a digital process for manufacturing.So what's and we have email, and we've had email for, for 10 years at least. Um, so what's the big deal about digital inventory? Cause if I wanna send a model anywhere in the world and have something made, I could do that 10 years ago.So why is digital inventory [...0.6s] a new thing? Um, and [...1.0s] I was also interested in the answers, my mood, and, and I think, [...0.9s] um, the, [...1.0s] the best answer somebody else gave, not my own answer, but, you know, was around, um, [...0.5s] the speed of, [...0.6s] can I go? Can I actually, [...0.6s] uh, print on demand?Effectively wound, wound up being I can print on demand because I have somebody's gonna send me not just a model, they're gonna send me a recipe that was quite nuanced [...0.6s] and is, [...0.6s] is, um, and I said, well, if, if you're sending these recipes, then how does anybody have competitive advantage?Because is it just, well, I've got a machine that will, you know, bake that recipe. Um, it is it just a commodity price style?And then there was some subtlety that, oh, you need to have the machine [...0.5s] calibrated, you need the right personnel, so that maybe is around the quality system that you've got in place.Again, that might be a differentiator that you've, you know, so I, [...0.6s] um, [...0.5s] I think [...1.2s] the issue of let, let's take the digital out of it, let's just look at infantry as a massive waste, Ahmed. Um, it's a billion dollar waste, isn't it?It's one of the seven wastes, um you know, Toyota recognise long time ago. Um, [...0.6s] so, [...0.5s] uh, and it, you know, [...0.7s] is the distinction between just in case and just in time. So we know, do I have the, [...1.0s] and, and can, [...0.7s] can modern manufacturing do it just in time?Um, I I, [...0.8s] and the distinction I think I made was [...0.8s] that as a, I'll say as a consumer in your lab to market, so presumably you have some offering to some customer, and one of my questions to you is what's your offering, and who's your ideal customer.But, but if if, [...0.7s] if I am a customer, and I showed a picture of an engine, um, [...0.6s] and I need a spare part for the engine, then while the original manufacturer of the engine, let's say it was Caterpillar, they may have a supply chain where they could get the new exhaust manifold, but me, [...0.5s] you know, if I'm stuck on my ship, but I need a new exhaust manifold, and Caterpillar tell me it'll be five years or five months before they can get me one.You know, can I just, why can't I have the cab modelling? Can I go and print it to a special recipe?Um, and I could sort myself out. So there's a right, [...0.7s] this is sort of an intersection, I think, with the right to repair. It's actually, I think a right to availability, um, [...0.5s] particularly for, um, sovereign assets.So, but probably needs to be [...0.6s] all of this [...0.6s] right, the rights need to be baked in probably [...0.5s] at the beginning of a contract.It's a bit too late [...0.5s] later, later on. So I didn't specifically answer your question, but I think there were some, some nuance dance, nuance dances. As I say, I'm not convinced that additive enables digital inventory. Uh. In fact, I don't think that it does.In my to, to be a bit more specific, there is nothing that I have ever printed in metal that did not require machining as well in order to be a functional component. So [...0.7s] if you need a new piston for your engine, I can print you a piston, but it won't fit in your engine until I've machined it as well.So why didn't I just take a block and machine it from solid? If it was a Formula 1 engine, my mood, and you were cheating on the compression ratio, which of course you should be for the new regulations.Then that's a different matter, but that's very new on, so [...0.5s] machining to me is still where the bar is set.Um, [...0.5s] and [...0.6s] yes, I need a cat, I need a cat model. If, if I want something made, um, I don't need to give a machine shop anything more than a cat model [...0.7s] and probably a drawing. Um, because it will specify the material on the tolerances. And [...0.6s] while we could do this all in card, it's a little complicated. Um, so I don't buy that.Additive is the some brand new way of, of doing this. And I don't believe by itself that additive [...0.7s] can [...0.5s] support [...0.5s] digital inventory for commercial customers.I don't believe that because, because, [...0.7s] and unless all of your parts are polymer [...0.8s] and pretty loose tolerances. Um, and I just don't know anybody who, whose products. You know, maybe it's Nike, and it's sports suit. You know, then maybe there's always exceptions to the rules.But but, but generally for, [...0.9s] for industrial products, um you know, it's an assembly of, of stuff, [...0.6s] and normally the tolerances require machine. [...1.1s] Yep, I come to get it. Thank you very much for the information, right, um yeah, yeah, yeah, that that, that was totally fine.I mean, the reason of asking this question is not specifically to get the right answer.It's try to get as much as information as I can get. So that is totally fine. I mean, that was fantastic. Um, [...0.7s] again I'm trying to reach out to one of your [...0.8s] answers to one of the comments, because again that post was awesome.I was just reading it all over, and you mentioned that there was a company, [...0.5s] because you mentioned about the recipe. I believe it was one of the comments, and you mentioned Hadrian. Yeah, exactly. So they're doing the same thing. I mean, they're doing all of this process.I think the, it was a response to somebody about building autonomous factories. Um, [...0.7s] and, and Hadrian are certainly looking quite hard [...0.7s] at [...1.1s] the Hadrian's [...0.5s] viewpoint, uh, and, yeah, I'm I'm, I'm not on the board of Hadrian, so if I misrepresent them, you know uh, tough.But Chris Power, who's the CEO, [...0.8s] they're explaining that manufacturing is broken, [...0.7s] um, that it's too fragmented as under invested, and everybody's gonna retire, so how we gonna fix it for the aerospace and defence industry, they're looking at [...0.6s] trying to create a system that has a lot less, a lot more automation for decision critically for decision making.My mood, I think not not, I'm not talking. Yes, they've got robots moving paths around, but that's to some extent the easy bit. It's how do you move [...0.6s] the workflow, um, what decisions are being taken? They're trying to automate that.Uh, and very interesting, the US based, they're not gonna play nicely with Canada. Um, so when, you know, we're Canadian. Um, so, [...0.7s] but and is, is manufacturing really broken?Um, [...0.5s] is, you know, can, can we [...0.8s] will the machine shops of the past 100 years, will they be replaced by [...0.6s] very capital intensive, um, operations run by some really smart people?Um, I have the great respect for what the people that Adrian have, um, whether they can, [...0.6s] and again this comes back to where you are right now, would love to market. Who's that customer? What is that customer gonna do?And my prediction would be [...0.5s] that their customers will dual source the work. They have an existing supplier, [...0.8s] and they will promise Adrian, [...1.0s] um, that we're going to source these parts with you.And what they will do is they'll source sort of 10% of the parts with Adrian. They'll keep 90% with the existing supplier. If Adrian perform, that percentage may change. And ideally it would, you know, Adrian would say, you should [...0.5s] kill the old supplier and move entirely to us. Um.But [...0.6s] I think the commercial adoption as we go to market will be, that's gonna be the acid test is how the people, [...0.7s] how do people respond and how much risk are they willing to take, no matter how attractive the solution appears technically. Um, and people, huh, people are strange animals.You know, the decisions that we take, um, and the reasons that we take them, so, um, I, I work for reneeshaw before [...0.6s] an amazing, uh, British company, amazing engineering prowess, [...0.7s] and sometimes the arguments were [...0.7s] that just look at how good our engineering is, you know, we make the best machines, but, but we didn't achieve, I say we reinish or did not achieve market dominance. They may well have the best machines, but they are not the No.1 supplier, [...0.5s] um, of machines. So I think you will see [...0.5s] plenty of examples where maybe the best technical solution is not the market leader. And I'll leave that as a question for you to sort of answer in your, in your work as to why that is. But, um, technical excellence doesn't guarantee market dominance. Makes sense.Perfect. Thank you very much. So it leads me to another question which is if you mention about [...0.9s] some kind of your previous company. It was rainshow, right, [...0.5s] yeah yeah, yeah, so at translugent at Red Range Shaw, what's the biggest barrier to getting customers to move from maybe am prototyping to production parts?I mean, you already answered that it was about the risking, obviously, how much they are going to be linked to risk, right?No, I know, I think it's simple for [...0.5s] now, the specific question around, am I think, I think the answer is easier. It's around, it's around the business case, [...0.5s] that, that there isn't a strong enough business case typically, [...0.5s] um, where additive is [...0.7s] out and out the, the clear winner.It's [...0.9s] attitude, and let me give you an example, um, that's often used is, you know, with additive, we can make paths lighter, and in aerospace that will save fuel in an aeroplane. Yeah, and so over the lifetime of the component, [...0.6s] the, um, will save 100 tons of fuel.And this is worth$5 million. But, but nobody is gonna give you that check up front for$5 million. In fact, nobody ever writes that check for$5 million. So [...0.7s] the, [...0.7s] the benefits, the lifetime benefits are sometimes hard to, [...0.5s] um, lay your hands on.When you can, for example, is on space. If you, if you if you launch into space, and you're charged by the kilogram, then maybe Spacex send you a smaller Bill if your, if your payload is lighter, so you win straight away there. Um, but, [...0.5s] but often the lifetime savings come out of a different budget.Medical is the best example. My mood where and again Renneshaw were very involved with medical, where I can have a new device that maybe saves [...0.5s] two hours in the operating theatre and two days hospital recovery because it's less invasive.However, if the device is three times as expensive, [...0.6s] then, and that budget comes out of, [...1.0s] um, some, it's somebody else's budget it's not the operating theatre budget. It's not the hospital budget, it's the [...0.7s] procedures but then the knee replacement person's budget.Then, then they're faced with this, this, this decision where they say, well, if, if this new device is 3 times as expensive then and I've only got the same budget, then I'll have to do 3 times fewer operations every year.So sorry, Manu, you can't have a new knee, [...0.6s] um, because the audio once not worn out yet, you're far too young. But it is. So, so this point about, [...0.7s] you know, [...0.7s] the Jerry Maguire show me the money, I think with additive it can be different budgets.There are real benefits [...0.7s] sometimes, but sometimes they're so obscure [...0.9s] and there may be over a time frame that is just again, there's risk as tight. And I say, well over 30 years time, you know, save you a lot of money, but you like, well, will we all be around in 30 years?Touch, [...0.5s] that's a bit negative, isn't it? You know what I mean? The immediacy of the disease, the stick, I think the sticker shock of a, um, is probably the biggest barrier because I can go get this, you know, [...0.5s] um, the company I work for now.This is certified to fly on an aeroplane. Um, but if I really needed one of these, I should take a lump of metal and go and machine it. Because it would be a much cheaper solution. Um, so, so I think it's the business case is the biggest barrier. Completely makes sense. Thank you. Um, [...0.6s] okay, this is another question that they have. Actually I was talking with Atlantic Excel there in New Zealand.Yeah, and, yeah, I was talking with one of the people Sean Morgan, and he told me a story about, so because recently they got into additive manufacturing around two or three years.And [...0.5s] so he was just telling me that right now they're not that much of a trust and confidence in, am obviously their relations, and as we mentioned the business plan and everything, but he told me to the story that since right now newfounds land because of the some kind of the transportation and because of the better in right now in some kind of the absolute place at some points, people are giving chances to.I am, for instance, he told me that before Christmas, they just gave, uh, a company [...0.8s] a product based on additive manufacturing because apparently they couldn't find that product on the, on time and they really need that and the outcome was great.So right now they're working on to get documentation to regulation to have this editing manufacturing to be [...0.5s] as a player actually there.How, [...0.9s] so kind of, what is your perspective about the future? Because in Canada, I found that still additive manufacturing [...0.5s] is still under development. I mean, it's not that kind of like us on Europe, they're still working on it.But how much do you think this kind of scenario that right now, as we are going to say that, okay, we would like everything to build inside the Canada, I mean we try to be somehow independent.Not, not all of that, but at least part of it. So how much of these scenarios you think is going to help additive manufacturing? Are they helpful at all or no? [...1.4s]Sorry, that was a bit of a fuzzy question there. Um, could you, could you make it a bit more cause I don't actually know what your question is. So the question is that one of the reasons that additive manufacturing cannot be a big player, obviously is about the regulation and documentation.So this is might be one of the reasons [...0.5s] and [...0.5s] these reasons, I mean, another kind of depart that we need departs to be here. At some points like Newfounds land, we are absolutely we are obsolete, so we need departs.We cannot wait it weeks to be shipped, but let's make it over here this kind of to some kind of scenarios side by side.Do you think these two matters are going to help additive manufacturing in few near future or not? We still need more time. [...1.4s] Um, [...0.6s] well, I think you've got, you got two two, I'm not sure.We got two or three things going on. One is, I think one of the questions is, is, um, [...0.6s] certification a barrier to adoption? And, and a simple answer is yes, it is a significant barrier to adoption because we keep regarding additive as a novel process. Um, we don't regard machining or welding as a novel process. Um, it's understood.We know, [...1.3s] we know what we want but, but people are still regarding additive as novel [...0.6s] and somehow it needs, um, extra layers, uh, added on top of it.Um, [...0.7s] so those extra layers come with a cost and time burden, which [...0.5s] then erodes the attractiveness [...0.6s] of additive either to deliver quickly or to deliver economically. Um, so, so yes, certification is a, [...0.5s] it is a barrier.You talked about Newfoundland and you said obsolete. I'm not sure whether you meant obsolete or the Newfoundland was, um, geographically isolated. Um, so no, the, the thing was about the obsolete or isolated to do.That would be better of work was because of the better, and because right now they only have one transportation system as cargo jet. I guess that's why they have to wait for plane to be there from other parts. That's the case.So the, the ability for sort of additive to provide a solution to remote communities. Um, yeah, I mean, 100% is one of the benefit, and poly unity, polyunity is probably the best example of, of, of that, um how they're doing it. And they're, and they're working within a regulated environment.So I'm sure you, if you haven't talked to Stephen Ryan or some, somebody from there, you will, [...0.5s] um, [...0.7s] uh, so, [...0.6s] um, [...0.6s] the the, uh, having remote communities is a, [...0.6s] um, it, it's, it's the opposite of a barrier, isn't it?It is a, um, whatever it's an on ramp 4 out of it because it can provide a solution. And, and even if the solution is a temporary one, um, having something is better than nothing. Um, you know, waiting for the cargo jet plane that can't, can't come in for three days because of bad weather.Um, and maybe I've got an oil rig or something that's down, and it's$1 million a day while it's down. Um, so [...0.7s] and your trading off sometimes, you know, well, am I willing to put something in place in order to bring the asset back up?And I think my mood, it really depends whether you're on a kind of, [...1.3s] if you're, [...0.5s] um, if you're on a wartime footing then um you will, you will take that decision.You will say, yes, you know, it's critical, I have to have this working. Um, if you're on a peace time footing, you're more risk of us and you're well, if I put it in and it now causes some other problem, there's an even bigger problem for my million dollar a day rig, then that was a really bad decision.So probably the decision I'm gonna make is I'll do, I'll, I'll wait for the cargo jet plane with the officially approved part. Because the, [...0.7s] the perceived risk of it going wrong versus the reward of getting the rig back up again in a couple of days.Um, you know, I, [...0.9s] I think it depends how much pressure you're under, um, and when, you know, um, [...0.7s] it's been interesting that space has been more willing to accept risk, because they will have no business [...0.5s] if they don't [...0.7s] populate, um, orbits with, with, with that products. Um yeah, that window will literally close.Um, so the appetite for risk is a little bit different in space, um, than it is saying in error. Um, yeah, yeah, completely get it thank you very much.I believe I do have all of my answers, but one last question was actually I was talking with Frank that some kind of, he encouraged me so obviously, when you're talking about the am, you're talking about devices and alongside be dead.We talk about the technology, one of the main technology that I'm really eager into these days. I mean, this is kind of the main part of my PhD is about the AI. So what is your perspective about using AI? I mean, some of we do have different kind of ideas.So some guys they say that it's a bubble and some guys say that no, it's a new gold. But what is your perspective about using the AI in [...0.6s] am or digital inventory? Do you see any some kind of [...0.6s] near future market for that or no, we have to have investment maybe for decades? [...1.1s]Yeah, [...0.6s] absolutely see a use for it. Why [...0.8s] we started this, didn't we? Why if we got inventory and I said, it wasn't it? We said, well, it's just in case. So don't we think that AI could tell us with a little bit more certainty whether I'm really gonna need that component or not?Um, uh, isn't it able to ingest [...0.6s] the entire usage of, you know, all of your parts sort it, you know, wire and, you know maybe [...0.6s] so to some extent it can, [...0.6s] uh, it can look at all of that data [...0.6s] versus we, you know, maybe the crude rules that we have minimum stock levels, this, you know, why did we set them like that?And we couldn't revisit them because it was too complicated, it involved to, you know, too many out, whereas AI could do this in the blink of an eye.Um, and, you know, maybe it can get to the root cause much better, um, [...0.8s] maybe, maybe, um, uh, in terms [...0.5s] of, you know, what, what, what parts are, [...0.5s] um what, what are the riskiest parts? Why do parts fail in the first place? Can I make them last longer?Um, asking scenario based question or helping the humans, so rather managing the inventory, how, how could we be smarter about all of this? Um, [...0.8s] the, [...0.6s] there, there was a saying um, [...0.5s] that, you know, the world's most expensive part is the one you haven't got. Um, and, uh, you know, so how, so how do, how do we, how do we address that? Uh and can AI help us?There's a company he was talking to today, Atlantic, uh, [...0.6s] and it's Atlantic with IQ on the end and they're looking at AI with shipbuilding doing some amazing work, um, that are definitely trying to, they're in Newfoundland. Um, the remn d is, uh, um, I forget his name anyway.Um, that marketing guy is somebody called bone, [...0.5s] um, but, um, [...0.7s] doing some really good stuff whether looking at requirements for ships [...0.6s] and using AI to figure out, um, when requirements aren't properly being met.It's very complicated making ships, um, with a lot of decision making. It's not inventory as such, but [...1.4s] sometimes we wind up with a ship [...0.6s] taking years or submarines taking years to build and stuff obsolete by time, we guess it.So [...1.4s] can we do things with greater velocity with AI? Yeah, um, and, you know, how so I'm, I'm opt, I'm optimistic. Um, [...0.8s] however, I've yet to see, [...1.4s] uh, I've yet to see AI, [...0.5s] um uh actually sort of helping somebody take, you know, a huge warehouse and say, you know, you don't need any of this stuff.I can confidently tell you, um, you know, you don't need you don't need it you can run it all down, we can shut, we can sell this for, you know, we can use it for, uh, for housing or something.But, yeah, no, I'd be, I'd be very optimistic that AI is going to help because it is such a big problem. And, and part of it is, [...0.6s] part of it I think my mood is, I think we're not very good at planning as humans, um, [...0.8s] and [...0.5s] whole bunch of reasons.Um, but, [...0.9s] you know, [...0.6s] like, I don't know whether you, you're doing your PhD now, but whether you've ever been, you know, did anybody ever teach you project management?Do you ever have a course on that? Have you ever run out of something that you really needed for your research? You know, some hardware, um, [...0.5s] uh you know, and it was because you, you planned badly, um, and, [...0.5s] and, you know, we, we text sometimes we're overly optimistic, um, sometimes we just don't plan at all.Um, and I think, [...0.7s] you know, again having better tools to give us different scenarios, and say if we did this, then maybe this would happen.I don't know if you read the book Thinking Fast and slow. Um, it's an interesting book, but about having choices, uh, and how as humans we tend to make better choices. Um, the specific example is, you know, would you give a dollar my mood to save dolphins being killed in fishing nets? And you might say, yes, I would or no, I wouldn't.And then I say [...0.5s] now, how about, would you give a dollar [...0.5s] to stop farm workers getting cancer because they're working too much in the fields? And, and your decision now is probably different, um, whether you're saving the dolphins or saving them.You know, um, so this averse and I think AI maybe giving us some [...0.7s] scenarios where as humans, we can add values to how we weigh them up. I, I would hope that, um, maybe we can, [...0.6s] maybe, maybe as a, as a species, we can make better decisions, but, you know, we'll stick with inventory for now if you like.What is your, [...0.6s] just [...0.5s] what is your product? Um my mood you know, you've asked me all the questions, so let me ask you one, what's your, [...0.5s] what's your, what are you trying to go to market with?Yes, so actually I was going to tell you after this one again, thank you very much for answering all of the questions. The reason I, I didn't talk about somehow in detail was because of two things.The very first part is that the idea still is raw, and the second part is that I, I wasn't trying to give you a bias, you know, sometimes.Yeah, yeah, [...1.0s] yeah yeah, yeah, I was just going to give you impression. So the idea that I do have right now and working on it is rather than just working on digital inventory AI, is to build an ecosystem, the ecosystem between the different entities or we call it as the segments like the Oems, the end users, the 3D printing facilities, authorities, and laps.I'm trying to work on this ecosystem to make a platform [...0.5s] to gather all of these pieces to puzzles, to be connected at one point try to have the communication and also give them some feature based on their needs.For instance, as you just mentioned, the end user needs to have the inventory and giving the digital inventor to him to say that, hey, I do have this product. Rather than just helping you for better communication, it also give you this feature.So I'm still working on that. And also beside that, obviously the digital inventory [...0.6s] and on top of it, AI would be very important part of that. It means that I'm trying to put my focus mostly on end user.But one thing that I found out so far with talking with experts like you and other people is that having the right way of communication, finding the right product for the right person, all of these things, apparently there is the missed puzzle over here, as you just mentioned about the planning.So somehow I'm trying to make this planning faster and easier for people. Hopefully I can do that obviously takes a lot of time and efforts, but this is the whole idea that I do have right now.So right now, what do you think about this idea? Do you think it's going to be the market value build or do I still need to do some PE? I think because again, I'm still at the researching phase. I'm trying to understand it.That's the whole idea. [...2.4s] My, my advice would be, [...2.0s] I, I think [...1.0s] one of the reasons planning is bad is our signals are bad. So I would be trying to focus on, [...0.7s] um, if you like, signal processing, um, and how can you know, how can AI help with clearer um, communication? [...1.1s]The I, I, [...0.6s] the idea of connecting the ecosystem with, you know, I have customers, I have Oems, I have manufacturers, um, but that sort of exists already. And, and they're linked loosely, [...0.5s] um, by, [...0.5s] um, you know, over existing supply chains or whatever.I, [...0.7s] I think the, [...2.1s] I, I'd like to believe that there's massive, what, you know, that, that as we said, we started this off and said, look, inventory is a billion dollar, and we can use chat GPT to tell us how big [...0.5s] the world's inventory is. But, but stuff that isn't moving, isn't doing anything, isn't adding any value.And so, [...0.7s] you know, but it, but it's there, you know, largely just in case how do we, how do we understand um, you know if we could reduce that inventory by [...0.9s] 10%, it would be, you know, [...0.7s] trillions, it would be cause it isn't a billion dollar problem, it's a trillion dollar problem.But so you, you solved a billion dollar problem, but how do you, how do you scale that? Um is it that you give everybody an app, [...0.6s] and, you know, with this app that all of a sudden, you know, tells them the past they don't need?Um, it, [...0.5s] most of the companies who, who, [...0.5s] who own all of this inventory, and it's the companies that only in the Oems largely that will own the inventory that they, they will.They tried to pass that off on other people that, like, you know, push it down the supply chain, but buying large one way or another, they wind up paying for the inventory.Um, [...0.8s] and it's, I think because of their poor, is it because they're [...0.5s] poorly connected with, um, what they're really going to need? Um, and can AI figure this out?Um, I, [...0.6s] I, I, [...0.6s] I don't know um I think in the end, there's a lot of people who've used, sort of AI tools to look at, say, text on the web to try and infer, [...0.7s] um, usage relationships. I'm not sure that's works incredibly well.I think if you could follow the money, my move, my, my theory. If you follow the money, you will actually expose the real [...0.5s] supply chains. But I don't think we can do that. Um, but if you have an app, if you have an app that can follow the money, then I think that would tell you everything you need to know.Um, but that might not be totally legal. Um, but, but that's where it really comes down.So, like, you know, who are [...0.6s] and you know, you mentioned in newfound London, you know, maybe there's not, maybe it's shall or so or something, you know, what's their supply train look like? And, and they typically know their first tier suppliers, but they don't know the second tier, the third tier.And, and, you know, it's, it's, that's where the wheels can fall off when they need something. Um, and there's been quite a lot of work about, [...0.7s] you know, [...0.7s] supply chain optimization.Um so I think, [...0.6s] you know, AI, um, yeah, the role in that I, I think the conversation Nicole heads up AI for manufacturing, and again it's a sort of, it's got giants in it, like semens, um, your, [...0.7s] you know, whatever you're gonna go to market with. I, I, I don't know.I think [...1.2s] there are a lot of people who are trying, and I, [...0.5s] I won't include you in this group I moved, but I'll call them snake oil salesman, [...0.5s] um, where they're like, oh, we're gonna bring everybody together and, you know, create the connections and and, and somehow there's, there's value in this, and, you know, people be able to print what they need on demand.I don't believe the print on demand. I don't believe there's much market there period. Um, so I think [...1.1s] in terms of the solving inventory problem, printing is not gonna be a big piece of a solution [...0.6s] now.However, having said that, if it was a [...0.6s] great solution for [...0.5s] 5% of the inventory problem, that's still worth solving. But you just have to recognise that it's a 5% solution and many have to be really good at, at what is the right 5% and most people are not good at that.So again, maybe there's help in, in some tools there. What are the right paths to print?And again, that's something Canada makes is trying to help with. You know, how do we get broader adoption? Do we provide tools that show people what are the right paths to print? So I don't know. Um, glad to be connected. Um, you know, I hope this has been useful for you.I've enjoyed the, I, I love questions and I'll, you know, happy to answer more uh, via email or whatever. Um, and let you get on for now. So, yeah, good, good luck with your hundred interviews. You obviously need to, you need to get two or three done a day and even then it's gonna take you a month.Yeah, exactly. And I just final last point is that again, as you just mentioned, is that it was a really, really good meeting for me. Again, thank for being in the short notice.I know you just passed our timing, but since right now I need to have more connection and I try to be meet more as people as many as possible. I need, I want you to ask that if you have anyone, some kind of in your networking that could be helpful for me, like the one that Frank did.And if I going to ask you that you will do that for me, that will be fantastic. It shouldn't be right. So can I make it? So can I make it? Can I make a suggestion to you? My mood, please, please, please.What? Why don't you do a post on LinkedIn [...0.7s] where you say had a great conversation with Mark Kirby, um, uh, about digital inventory. Um I suggest don't post it as a comment to the thread we've already got going cause it'll get lost in the noise.Create a new post. Um, I looked, I looked at you on LinkedIn you're a little bit difficult to figure out because you're sort of, yeah, and maybe that's deliberate, um, but do a post, you know, tag me in it and I'll, [...0.6s] I'll respond back.And that, that may at least then expose some more people who want to talk to you. Um, you know, I'll also say you know, really enjoyed, um, you know, um, the Q&A session with my mood, and I know he'd like to talk to more people.Um, so if you fancy, uh, uh, a quick reeling, um looking up something like that, I, I don't know. Um, just, just do a post, um, [...0.5s] and, and that might, that might help you it'd be a lot easier than, you know, so I can't say oh, you should talk to someone.So, so I mentioned polyunity, [...0.5s] there are lots of other, there are lots of other people who be useful to talk to, but yeah, um, I think a post is the best way to try and bring them to you. Yeah, fantastic, that's fantastic. Perfect. Thank you, thank you very much. Okay, [...0.5s] Ciao, bye bye. [...4.9s][...4.9s]
