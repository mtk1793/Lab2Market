## 5 Key Questions

### 1. Spare Parts Emergency Response & Lead Times
**When a customer has a critical engine or propulsion system failure on a vessel or offshore platform, what does the emergency response look like from a parts perspective?**

- How long does it typically take to get critical parts to remote offshore locations?
- Have you ever seen vessels/platforms down for weeks or months waiting for a part?
- What's the financial impact of that downtime on customers?

**→ Validates:** 6-month lead time pain (like OMV), downtime costs, "breakdown insurance" positioning

---

### 2. Digital Inventory Concept
**If you could have a "digital inventory" where certain parts existed as CAD files and could be manufactured on-demand at the nearest certified facility, which parts would be most valuable for that approach?**

- Emergency breakdown parts? Obsolete/legacy parts? Customized components?
- What percentage of your service parts might be candidates?
- What would need to be true for MAN to adopt this model? (certification? cost thresholds? quality guarantees?)

**→ Validates:** Digital inventory fit for marine/offshore, part categories, adoption requirements

---

### 3. Certification Barriers
**Marine and offshore industries are heavily regulated. How does certification work for replacement parts, and what hurdles would an additively manufactured emergency part face before installation?**

- Classification societies (DNV, Lloyd's, ABS)? Flag state requirements?
- Can third-party manufacturers provide certified parts, or must they come from MAN?
- Material vs. process vs. inspection certifications?

**→ Validates:** NH.7 (Certification is primary gatekeeper), feasibility vs. showstopper

---

### 4. Cost/ROI Threshold
**When evaluating new service models or technologies, what ROI or cost savings threshold does MAN typically require before adoption?**

- Is there a specific percentage (e.g., 15% like offshore oil & gas operators mentioned)?
- For offshore customers, what does unplanned downtime cost per day on average?
- How does that compare to the cost of maintaining spare parts inventory?

**→ Validates:** NH.12 (Cost/ROI is #1 barrier), quantifies value proposition ($500K+/day downtime?)

---

### 5. AI & Predictive Maintenance
**How do you currently predict which parts are likely to fail and when, so you can pre-position inventory? Is there any predictive analytics or AI involved?**

- Do you have access to real-time operational data from customer vessels/platforms?
- If an AI system could analyze operational data and recommend "stock this part physically" vs. "keep this part in digital inventory for on-demand manufacturing," would that be valuable?

**→ Validates:** KR.1 (AI integration provides differentiation), data access, decision automation opportunity
