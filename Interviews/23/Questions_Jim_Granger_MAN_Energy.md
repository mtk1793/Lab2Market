## Interview Questions

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

1. **Thank you for taking the time to speak with me, Jim. I'm Mahmoud Kiasari from Dalhousie University, working on customer discovery for a digital inventory and on-demand manufacturing platform. Could you start by telling me about your role at MAN Energy Solutions Canada?**

2. **What are the primary industries and customer segments you serve in the Canadian market?**
   - *Probe:* Offshore oil & gas? Commercial shipping? Defense/Navy?

---

### Spare Parts & Supply Chain Challenges (10 minutes)

3. **When a customer has a critical engine or propulsion system failure on a vessel or offshore platform, what does the emergency response process look like from a parts perspective?**
   - *Probe:* How long does it typically take to get critical parts to remote locations?
   - *Probe:* What are the most common failure points?

4. **What are the biggest supply chain challenges you face in delivering parts and service to marine/offshore operations?**
   - *Probe:* Lead times? Geographic distance? Certification delays?
   - *Probe:* Are there specific parts that are particularly problematic?

5. **How does MAN currently manage spare parts inventory for customers—do you maintain regional warehouses, or do customers stock their own spare parts?**
   - *Probe:* What's the trade-off between inventory holding costs vs. availability?
   - *Probe:* Are there parts that customers struggle to justify keeping in stock due to cost or shelf life?

6. **Have you ever encountered situations where a vessel or platform was down for weeks or months waiting for a replacement part?**
   - *Probe:* What was the financial impact on the customer?
   - *Probe:* Could that part have been manufactured locally if the design files were available?

---

### Additive Manufacturing & Digital Inventory (8 minutes)

7. **Are you currently using additive manufacturing (3D printing) for any parts in your service operations or product offerings?**
   - *Probe:* If yes: Which parts? What materials? What's been the experience?
   - *Probe:* If no: Have you explored it? What's holding you back?

8. **If you could have a "digital inventory" where certain parts existed as CAD files and could be manufactured on-demand at the nearest certified facility, which parts would be most valuable for that approach?**
   - *Probe:* Emergency breakdown parts? Obsolete/legacy parts? Customized components?
   - *Probe:* What percentage of your service parts might be candidates?

9. **What would need to be true for MAN to adopt a digital inventory + on-demand manufacturing model for select parts?**
   - *Probe:* Certification requirements? Cost thresholds? Quality guarantees?
   - *Probe:* Who would need to be convinced internally (engineering vs. procurement vs. service)?

---

### Certification & Regulation (5 minutes)

10. **Marine and offshore industries are heavily regulated. How does certification work for replacement parts in your operations?**
    - *Probe:* Classification societies (DNV, Lloyd's, ABS)? Flag state requirements?
    - *Probe:* Can third-party manufacturers provide certified parts, or must they come from MAN?

11. **If a customer needed an emergency replacement part that was additively manufactured, what certification hurdles would that part face before installation?**
    - *Probe:* Material certifications? Process certifications? Inspection requirements?

---

### Cost & ROI (5 minutes)

12. **When evaluating new technologies or service models, what ROI or cost savings threshold does MAN typically require before adoption?**
    - *Probe:* Is there a specific percentage (e.g., 15% like OMV Austria mentioned)?

13. **For offshore customers, what does unplanned downtime cost them per day, on average?**
    - *Probe:* Does that vary significantly by vessel/platform type?
    - *Probe:* How does that compare to the cost of maintaining spare parts inventory?

---

### AI & Decision Support (3 minutes)

14. **MAN has a global service network. How do you currently predict which parts are likely to fail and when, so you can pre-position inventory?**
    - *Probe:* Is there any predictive analytics or AI involved?
    - *Probe:* Do you have access to real-time operational data from customer vessels/platforms?

15. **If an AI system could analyze operational data and recommend "stock this part physically" vs. "keep this part in digital inventory for on-demand manufacturing," would that be valuable?**
    - *Probe:* What data would the AI need access to?

---

### Strategic Positioning (3 minutes)

16. **As you look at the future of marine service operations, do you see distributed manufacturing becoming more common, or will centralized MAN facilities remain the standard?**
    - *Probe:* What would drive the shift?

17. **For a startup building an AI-driven digital inventory platform for offshore/marine operations, what would be the most compelling value proposition?**
    - *Probe:* "Reduce downtime by X%"? "Eliminate $Y in inventory holding costs"? "Ensure mission continuity"?

---

### Ecosystem & Partnerships (3 minutes)

18. **Are there other companies in the marine/offshore ecosystem I should speak with to understand spare parts challenges better?**
    - *Probe:* Offshore platform operators? Vessel owners? Classification societies?

19. **Would MAN Energy Solutions be open to participating in a pilot or proof-of-concept for digital inventory + on-demand manufacturing for select parts?**
    - *Probe:* What would make that pilot valuable for MAN?

---

### Closing (2 minutes)

20. **What's the one thing about marine/offshore spare parts management that you wish more people understood?**

21. **Is there anything I didn't ask about that you think is important for someone building a solution in this space?**

22. **Thank you so much for your time, Jim. Can I follow up if additional questions come up as I continue my research?**

## Key Topics to Listen For

| Topic | Why It Matters | Hypothesis Link |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Emergency part lead times** | Validates "breakdown insurance" positioning | NH.21 |
| **Downtime costs** | Quantifies value proposition | Cost/ROI threshold |
| **Current AM usage** | Understand adoption baseline | AM readiness |
| **Certification process** | Validates barrier vs. opportunity | NH.7 |
| **Predictive maintenance** | AI differentiation opportunity | KR.1 |
| **Regional inventory strategy** | Distributed manufacturing fit | Geographic model |
| **Safety vs. cost priorities** | Validates Harvey Doane's framework | NH.15 |

---

## Hypotheses to Validate

- [ ] **NH.15:** Safety > Time > Cost framework applies to marine/offshore (already validated by Harvey Doane)
- [ ] **NH.12:** Cost/ROI is primary barrier (89% per PRIMA data)
- [ ] **NH.7:** Certification is primary gatekeeper for AM adoption
- [ ] **NH.21:** "Breakdown insurance" resonates as value proposition
- [ ] **KR.1:** AI-driven inventory decisions provide differentiation
- [ ] **NEW:** Marine/offshore has similar pain points to oil & gas (6-month lead times, high downtime costs)
- [ ] **NEW:** Global service networks are compatible with distributed manufacturing model

---

## Pre-Interview Research

- [ ] Review MAN Energy Solutions Canada portfolio (marine engines, offshore systems)
- [ ] Research marine classification societies (DNV, Lloyd's, ABS) and certification requirements
- [ ] Identify common marine engine failure modes and associated parts
- [ ] Review shipping/offshore industry news for recent downtime incidents
- [ ] Prepare specific examples of AM-compatible parts (brackets, housings, piping components)
- [ ] Check if MAN has published anything on digital transformation or Industry 4.0

---

## Expected Insights

### Best Case:
- Confirms 6-month+ lead times for critical marine parts
- Identifies specific part categories suitable for on-demand manufacturing
- Expresses openness to pilot/collaboration
- Provides quantitative downtime cost data ($500K+/day)
- Confirms certification is manageable barrier, not insurmountable

### Worst Case:
- MAN vertically integrated, no interest in third-party manufacturing
- Certification requirements make AM infeasible for marine applications
- Lead times not actually a problem (strong regional inventory already)
- Digital inventory concept doesn't resonate with marine service model

### Most Likely:
- Mixed adoption potential (some parts yes, others no)
- Certification is significant but not impossible barrier
- Cost/ROI threshold similar to OMV (15%+)
- Interest in concept but need proof from other sectors first (fast-follower)

## Connection to Overall Strategy

**Segment:** Offshore O&G / Marine Operations (Second Priority)

**Why Jim Granger Interview is Critical:**
1. MAN serves both marine and offshore O&G → validates segment overlap
2. Service network spans remote locations → distributed manufacturing fit
3. Emergency response expertise → "breakdown insurance" validation
4. Certification knowledge → de-risk NH.7 barrier
5. Potential anchor customer for marine segment (like Lee Vessey for defense)

**Strategic Questions:**
- Is marine/offshore O&G distinct enough to warrant separate positioning?
- Should we pursue MAN as partner vs. direct customer?
- Does certification complexity justify focusing on defense first (lower barrier)?

## Notes

> **From OMV Interviews (Chris & Mikhail):**  
> - 6-month valve wait times  
> - 15% ROI threshold required  
> - Fast-follower strategy (need proof from other sectors first)  
> - IP protection concerns for cloud-based digital inventory

> **From Harvey Doane (Maritime Launch - Space):**  
> - Safety > Time > Cost framework (likely applies to marine too)  
> - "Sell what they're buying" (mission assurance, not tech features)  
> - Temporary solutions for emergency response

> **Key Differentiation Opportunity:**  
> If MAN validates that marine/offshore has similar pain points to O&G, we can position as "marine + offshore unified platform" rather than separate solutions.
