# Interview #55 — Insights
## Polyunity Tech | Steven (Co-Founder & CMO)
**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Relevance to AddManuChain:** 9/10 — direct parallel platform in healthcare; same model, different vertical
**Interview type:** Peer/Competitor discovery + potential collaboration

## Why This Interview Matters

Steven and Polyunity are doing in healthcare exactly what AddManuChain is trying to do in offshore oil & gas and defense. This is not a customer interview — it is a **mirror interview**. Every barrier they have solved, AddManuChain will face. Every shortcut they discovered, AddManuChain can adapt. And Steven explicitly opened a collaboration conversation.

## Insight #1 — The 3-Tier Platform Model is the Right Architecture

Polyunity serves three types of customers with the same platform:
- **Tier 1:** Operators who want a "click and receive" service (Polyunity handles everything)
- **Tier 2:** Operators with some printers who want QMS software to bring order to their existing setup
- **Tier 3:** Mature ecosystems that want to license the full platform and run it themselves

**For AddManuChain:** This is exactly the model for oil and gas:
- Tier 1 = small offshore operators, Arctic remote utilities (no in-house AM capability)
- Tier 2 = larger O&G operators with some on-site printers (e.g., a rig that has one machine)
- Tier 3 = Tier 1 integrators or large navies that want to own the workflow and run it internally

Do not build a one-size product. Build the platform with three engagement modes from day one. The enterprise-software model at Tier 3 is where the durable revenue lives.

## Insight #2 — The Multi-Stage Approval Pipeline is the Product, Not the Print

The most important thing Polyunity built is not a 3D printer network — it is the **compliance pipeline**: idea → feasibility gate → prototype → certification gate → finance/procurement gate → digital inventory. The print is just the last step.

**For AddManuChain:** The same is true. The value is not the print. The value is the certified, traceable, auditable path from request to qualified part. That pipeline — with its gates mapped to DNV/LR/ABS standards instead of Health Canada — is the core IP of AddManuChain. The print centers are a commodity. The compliance workflow is the moat.

**Implication for sales:** You are not selling 3D printing. You are selling the approval pipeline that makes 3D printing acceptable inside a regulated organization. Procurement teams, HSE leads, and legal departments are your real decision-makers — not engineers.

## Insight #3 — The "Approval Cascade" Eliminates 50% of Sales Friction

Once a part has passed through the full compliance pipeline and been approved by one organization, all future organizations can reuse that approval. They skip the entire front-end process and just order.

**For AddManuChain:** This is the network effect flywheel:
- Part #1 takes the longest (full design + full cert + full approval)
- Part #2 at a different operator costs half the time (cert already exists, reuse it)
- Part #100 in the catalogue is near-instant (everything is already lit up green)
- The larger the shared catalogue, the faster each new operator gets started

The catalogue becomes the asset. Build and grow it aggressively. Each pre-certified part in the library reduces acquisition friction for every future customer.

## Insight #4 — IP Strategy: Own the Design, Not the OEM's Blueprints

Polyunity's IP approach:
- When someone describes a **problem** → Polyunity designs the solution → Polyunity owns the IP. Simple.
- When someone asks for a **replacement of a specific OEM part** → case-by-case; individual components are often not separately protectable; warranty windows narrow the OEM's leverage.
- Canadian **right-to-repair legislation** now gives procurement and engineering teams legal standing to source replacement parts from non-OEM suppliers.

**For AddManuChain:**
- Do not wait for OEMs to hand over blueprints. Focus first on novel parts, obsolete parts, and non-critical components where OEMs have little leverage.
- Build the catalogue starting with parts that have no active OEM protection: discontinued lines, end-of-life components, custom brackets/fittings/mounts.
- The right-to-repair argument applies directly to offshore O&G: OEM warranties on rig equipment expire; operators need the ability to repair without waiting for Rotterdam.
- When OEMs do eventually engage, Steven's prediction matches this project's model: they will want to be licensed distributors on the platform, not competitors.

## Insight #5 — Procurement Entry Strategy: Go Sub-Threshold First

Polyunity's technique for navigating large institutional procurement:
- Identify a single department with a single problem
- Keep the project value **below the discretionary budget threshold** (the level at which a department manager can approve without escalating to CFO/CEO — often ~$10K)
- Deliver disproportionate ROI: spend $5K, solve a $100K problem
- Use that case as the packaged pitch for enterprise-level escalation

**For AddManuChain in oil and gas:**
- Discretionary budget thresholds exist on rigs and in supply chain departments too
- Target: find one supply chain manager or maintenance lead who has budget authority under ~$50K (or whatever the rig's threshold is)
- Pilot: identify 5–10 non-critical obsolete parts, digitize them, print one, deliver with full audit trail
- That one case — demonstrating lead time reduction from 9 weeks to 4 days on a real part — becomes the packaged enterprise pitch to the VP Supply Chain or CPO

## Insight #6 — AI Should Be the Pipeline Engine, Not the Front-End Feature

Polyunity's AI ("Poly") is currently a QMS chatbot. Its target state is a **fully automated compliance engine**: natural language input → automated feasibility, design, machine selection, material selection, production push → part off the machine with no human involvement.

**For AddManuChain:** This is the right long-term target for the AI layer in the digital inventory system. Do not lead with AI in sales materials (validated by other interviews). But build toward it as the core automation engine:
- AM suitability scoring (which parts in your inventory are printable?)
- Automated certification matching (which cert pathway applies per part?)
- Automatic print routing (which center, which machine, which material?)
- Automated audit log generation on completion

The AI does not replace trust — it operationalizes it at scale.

## Insight #7 — The University-Industry Hybrid Structure: Real Tradeoffs

Steven was unusually direct about his own cautionary experience:
- He tried to commercialize out of Memorial University and **lost his IP** — had to rebuild from zero to create Polyunity.
- The trade-off is real: inside academia = easier access to defense/government R&D funding (they have mandatory spending to university entities); outside academia = you own what you build.

**For AddManuChain directly:**
- The IP dispute with the Ottawa industrial partner is not a bureaucratic annoyance — it is a company-defining decision. Resolve it with a signed agreement before any external funding or partnership is formalized.
- Steven's advice aligns exactly with the Osler LLP funding session: clean IP chain-of-title is the #1 fundraising prerequisite.
- The defense angle: DND-to-Dalhousie research contracts are easier to land than DND-to-startup contracts. Use the university as the channel to access that capital — but ring-fence the IP through a clear agreement first.

## Insight #8 — This is a Partnership Opportunity, Not a Competitor

Steven explicitly said:
> *"We can't afford to compete as an industry. We need to raise all ships. Work with me to figure out these things versus competing for one oil and gas contract."*

He asked what stage AddManuChain is at and said he would want a follow-up conversation.

**Specific areas of potential synergy:**
| What AddManuChain has/is building | What Polyunity has/needs |
|---|---|
| Oil & gas and defense vertical focus | Neither — healthcare only so far |
| Lloyd's Register / DNV GL certification pathway | Health Canada compliance pathway (different standard) |
| Connection to Equinor, ExxonMobil, naval programs | Entry to O&G/defense clients |
| Canada-based platform positioning | Already Canada-based with provincial contracts |
| Digital inventory platform (MVP) | Full compliance pipeline software (production) |

**Recommended next step:** Schedule a follow-up call with Steven after the Engine Summit (Toronto, April 1). Come with a clear ask: can Polyunity's existing compliance pipeline architecture (the software layer) be licensed or white-labeled as the QMS foundation for the AddManuChain platform for the O&G vertical?

## Key Quotes for Use

> *"The infrastructure of what we've built is transferable — defense, oil and gas, mining — insert thing here where you need digital inventory and a part out the other side."*

> *"Once a part has gone through the rigor of one hospital, it'll go through the rigor of another. That removes the entire front-end design and approval process — just order it."*

> *"You told us a problem. That's not intellectual property. We take the thing, design it, put it in our inventory. It's our IP."*

> *"I think we're moving into a future where OEMs will have no choice but to digitize the parts they can — or they'll say, host all my parts and be a licensed distributor."*

> *"Everybody is just going to replicate and duplicate work. We need to raise all ships."*

> *"I lost everything trying to commercialize out of university. That's why Polyunity was made as a separate entity."*

## 30-Day Actions from This Interview

1. **Follow-up email to Steven** — thank him, reference the partnership ask, propose a 30-minute call after the Engine Summit.
2. **Adapt the 3-tier platform model** into the AddManuChain product deck. Name the three engagement modes clearly.
3. **Map the compliance pipeline** for oil and gas — the equivalent of Polyunity's clinical engineering → IPC → finance gates, but for DNV/LR workflows. This pipeline map is the core product demo.
4. **Resolve IP ownership** with Ottawa industrial partner before the Engine Summit. Do not pitch investors or partners without this resolved.
5. **Start building the parts catalogue** with obsolete, discontinued, or non-critical components — items with no active OEM protection — as the initial inventory base.
6. **Identify the discretionary budget threshold** for a target rig or offshore operator's maintenance department. Design the first pilot to fit under it.
