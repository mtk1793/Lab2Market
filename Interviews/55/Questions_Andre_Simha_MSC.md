## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

André Simha just spent 38 years at the helm of digital operations for the world's largest container shipping company. He's now transitioning out — which means he's reflective, candid, and no longer bound by MSC's institutional communication posture. This is a rare window.

Three specific reasons this conversation matters for AddManuChain:

1. **Maritime MRO at scale**: MSC's 520-vessel fleet needs constant maintenance. Spare parts for marine engines, pumps, valves, and deck equipment are a daily operational reality across 500 ports worldwide. Nobody has more experience with this at global scale than André's team.

2. **The digital supply chain is his life's work**: He co-founded DCSA to standardize digital shipping, championed IoT smart containers at MSC, and ran INTTRA (the ocean industry's largest e-commerce platform) for 17 years. He will have deeply-formed views on what "digital inventory" means in practice — and where it fails.

3. **He's transitioning — candor is available**: André's farewell post says the journey was "not so much about technology itself. It's about the people, the mindset shifts." He's operating in reflection mode. That's precisely when the most honest answers about entrenched supply chain dysfunction come out.

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

---

### Q1 — Spare parts reality for a 520-vessel fleet: what does the MRO supply chain actually look like?

> *"André, MSC operates 520 vessels calling at 500 ports globally. Every single day something on those ships needs a replacement part — engine components, pumps, valves, navigation equipment. From your 38 years at MSC, what does the spare parts supply chain actually look like operationally? Is it centralized global warehousing, agent networks at each port, or is it effectively improvised ship by ship?"*

**Follow-ups:** What's the worst category of spare parts to source — OEM-specific marine engine components, custom fabricated parts, electronics? Has a parts availability issue ever caused an unscheduled port call or vessel off-hire? How much of MSC's spare parts inventory sits on the ships themselves vs. ashore?

---

### Q2 — Blockchain and digital inventory: what did you actually try, and what worked?

> *"You've been vocal about blockchain in shipping since at least 2018, and DCSA has been driving standardization for years. In practice — what did MSC actually pilot or deploy in digital supply chain, and what's your honest assessment of what moved the needle vs. what was a good idea that didn't land? We're building a platform that uses cryptographic tokens to authorize print orders for spare parts — the part doesn't exist until someone authorized it. I'm curious where you see that kind of 'digital rights management for physical things' fitting into the maritime supply chain conversation."*

**Follow-ups:** Did blockchain in shipping solve a real problem or mostly a provenance/documentation problem? Where did standardization (DCSA) actually unlock something that bilateral agreements couldn't? Is the maritime industry genuinely ready to trust a token-based authorization system for physical parts, or is that 10 years away?

---

### Q3 — Smart containers and IoT: if you know what's on the ship, can you predict what breaks?

> *"TRAXENS, smart containers, real-time cargo monitoring — you've been pushing IoT into maritime for years. The obvious extension of that, from a maintenance perspective, is: if you have real-time sensor data from equipment on a vessel, you can predict what's going to fail before it does, and pre-position the right spare part at the right port. Has MSC — or the broader industry — actually gotten there? Or is predictive maintenance for maritime equipment still more aspiration than operational reality?"*

**Follow-ups:** What's the biggest data gap between 'sensor on the ship' and 'part pre-positioned at the next port call'? Is the bottleneck data, logistics, or organizational — nobody owns predictive maintenance end-to-end? If a platform could close that loop — predict failure, authorize a certified replacement to be printed near the vessel's next port — is that a product the maritime industry would actually buy?

---

### Q4 — The OEM problem in marine: who controls the parts, and what does that mean for on-demand manufacturing?

> *"One of the structural barriers we keep hitting in every sector is OEM control over spare parts — proprietary specs, license agreements that restrict third-party manufacturing, liability clauses. For a company the size of MSC, are the major marine engine OEMs — MAN, Wärtsilä, Caterpillar Marine — actually cooperative partners or silent monopolists on spare parts? And as parts for older vessel equipment become discontinued or have 12-month lead times, has MSC ever explored third-party or on-demand manufacturing as a legitimate alternative?"*

**Follow-ups:** Has MSC ever had a situation where a part for a vessel was simply unavailable and had to be manufactured from scratch by a third party? How does classification society certification (Lloyd's, DNV, Bureau Veritas) interact with OEM part sourcing — can a third-party manufactured part pass class survey? What would a marine OEM need to see before they'd agree to digitize their specs and allow authorized third-party printing?

---

### Q5 — Digital transformation lessons: what actually changes behaviour in a conservative industry?

> *"You wrote in your farewell post that 'it's not so much about technology itself — it's about the people, the mindset shifts, and the moments that shape progress.' You've spent 38 years trying to digitize one of the most traditional industries in the world. For someone building a new digital platform in maritime supply chain — what's the honest lesson about what actually changes behaviour in this industry? What made shipping companies adopt INTTRA, DCSA standards, or smart containers — and what are the things that looked like they'd work but didn't?"*

**Follow-ups:** Was adoption of digital shipping tools faster when it saved money, when it reduced regulatory risk, or when a dominant player (like MSC) simply mandated it for their supply chain partners? For a startup — as opposed to MSC — what's the realistic path to getting maritime operators to change a purchasing or procurement behaviour?

---

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

---

### B1 — What comes next for André, and is there an overlap?

> *"You mentioned you'll share more about what comes next 'in due course.' Without asking you to reveal anything prematurely — are you looking at advisory, board, or operating roles in the maritime tech space? I ask genuinely, not as a pitch: we're 55 interviews in and André Simha's perspective on digital supply chain at global maritime scale is the kind of thing that's shaped the whole conversation for me."*

---

### B2 — Referrals into MSC's vessel operations and supply chain teams

> *"Two specific asks: First, who within MSC actually owns the vessel maintenance and spare parts strategy — is that a central fleet management function in Geneva, or is it distributed by region and vessel class? Second, is there a specific person on the procurement or vessel operations side at MSC who deals with the 'part we can't get / can't get fast enough' problem operationally, that might give me 20 minutes?"*

## KEY HYPOTHESES TO VALIDATE

| # | Hypothesis | Question |
|---|------------|----------|
| H1 | Marine spare parts for a global fleet are managed through distributed agent networks, not centralized digital inventory — creating predictable inefficiency | Q1 |
| H2 | Blockchain/digital supply chain pilots in maritime solved documentation problems but not physical parts sourcing | Q2 |
| H3 | IoT/predictive maintenance data exists but is siloed — nobody closes the loop from sensor → pre-positioned spare → certified print | Q3 |
| H4 | Marine OEMs are the primary structural barrier to third-party AM parts — classification societies are secondary | Q4 |
| H5 | Digital adoption in maritime is driven by dominant player mandates or regulatory pressure, not organic startup adoption | Q5 |

## CONTEXT TO SHARE WITH ANDRÉ

- AddManuChain: Canadian platform for **digital spare parts inventory + AM production + DRM certification pipeline** — currently focused on offshore oil & gas, maritime, and Canadian Navy
- **55 interviews** completed — including Equinor (Hebron platform), Atlantic XL (Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility in St. John's, Americas' first), Irving Shipbuilding, and the Canadian Navy (Thales/Lee Vessey)
- **Atlantic XL** = our anchor manufacturing partner — first Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility in the Americas; located in St. John's, NL, close to Atlantic shipping routes
- One recurring signal across all maritime/offshore interviews: *"The OEM either doesn't make the part anymore, or it takes 6 months to arrive — we need a better option"*
- Our DRM approach — cryptographic token that authorizes a single print run on a specific certified printer — directly addresses the OEM IP and traceability concerns André has championed through DCSA

## FRAMING NOTES

**This is a peer-level conversation with an industry titan who is transitioning.** André has nothing to prove and no company line to protect anymore. Lead with respect for his career and genuine curiosity — not a sales pitch.

**His DCSA and INTTRA background is the entry point.** He spent 17 years on INTTRA's board because he believed in standardizing ocean e-commerce. Our DRM pipeline for physical parts is the same concept applied to manufacturing. Frame it that way.

**The farewell post is a gift.** He says he learned more from the people and mindset shifts than the technology. Ask him what the hardest mindset shift was — that answer will be pure gold for how AddManuChain approaches adoption strategy.

**Don't confuse outgoing with irrelevant.** He's still Chairman of DCSA, still on the TRAXENS board. His network and influence in the maritime digital space remains enormous.
