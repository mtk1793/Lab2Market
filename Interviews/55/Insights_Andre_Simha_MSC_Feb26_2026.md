## Key Insights

### 1. Spare Part Supply Chain is Centralised but Distributed in Practice
MSC manages spare parts procurement centrally from a ship management office in Cyprus. Distribution is pragmatic: ships of the same class share parts and can resupply each other at transshipment ports. There is no digital-native spare parts marketplace — multiple competing platforms are used, with no single standard.

> **Implication for AddManuChain:** A centralised procurement model creates a clear single point of entry for a digital inventory or additive manufacturing platform. The "same-class ship" interoperability is a direct analogue to digital inventory sharing across a fleet.

---

### 2. Data Quality is the Real Blocker — Not Technology
André was explicit: AI, ML, and blockchain are not the bottleneck. Data quality across the multi-party shipping ecosystem is. Third-party terminals, truckers, and rail operators provide incomplete, delayed, or inconsistent data. Even with 200–300 IoT-equipped ships, the systems to act on that data are immature.

> **Implication:** Before pitching AI-driven predictive maintenance, validate that target customers have data pipelines capable of feeding it. Position AddManuChain's digital inventory layer as a *data quality improvement* mechanism, not just a fulfilment tool.

---

### 3. IoT is Deployed but Under-Utilised
MSC has IoT on both containers (security/integrity) and ships (engine sensors, fuel, emissions). However, the industry still largely processes this data through Excel and static dashboards. No real predictive-to-supply pipeline exists at scale.

> **Implication:** The gap identified in Q3 is a genuine opportunity. An automated link from sensor anomaly detection → digital inventory check → 3D print-on-demand trigger is not yet being done operationally. This validates the hypothesis that the supply chain signal-to-action loop is broken.

---

### 4. Blockchain Hype Cycle is Over — APIs Won
MSC trialled blockchain via WaveBL (bill of lading) and TradeLens (IBM/Maersk). Both were largely about document integrity, not supply chain operations. DCSA pivoted from EDI to APIs early. André acknowledged that blockchain was "fashionable" at the time — the real lesson is that interoperability and trust are what matter, not the tech.

> **Implication:** Do not position AddManuChain around blockchain. Emphasise API-based interoperability and open standards. DCSA's API ecosystem is the right integration target.

---

### 5. Trust is the #1 Ecosystem Killer
André's most direct lesson: TradeLens failed primarily because of *trust*, not technology. IBM + Maersk co-owning the platform alienated other carriers from day one. No party wants a competitor or a large vendor holding their data.

> **Implication:** AddManuChain's governance model must be neutral. Consider a co-operative or multi-stakeholder structure. Emphasise data segregation: each party must only see what they're supposed to see.

---

### 6. "What's in it for me?" is Non-Negotiable
André repeatedly emphasised that ecosystem adoption fails when the *why* is not communicated. In shipping, even operators close to the process didn't understand the importance of what they were doing (moving a container so a factory can produce goods). The value proposition must be articulated at the level of each individual participant — not the platform owner.

> **Implication:** Segment your value proposition by stakeholder: shipping companies get cost reduction and supply chain independence; OEMs get new revenue from digital licensing; regulators/classification societies get traceability and compliance.

---

### 7. Post-COVID Mindset Shift is Real — Tariff Fragility is the Accelerant
André independently validated the core macro thesis: COVID showed companies they can't rely on China or India as the sole source; tariff volatility from the USA makes supply chain independence even more urgent, especially in Canada.

> **Implication:** Lead with *supply chain resilience* and *on-demand localisation* in the pitch — not 3D printing as a technology. André's framing: if you can manufacture something on demand locally, you solve supply chain AND cost, AND sustainability. This is the pitch.

---

### 8. OEM IP is a Real Barrier — but André Had No Direct Experience
André was honest that he doesn't have enough depth on OEM IP conversations. He validated the 3D printing local-manufacturing concept using an analogy (a supply chain head who moved production from China to Europe for made-to-order goods), but noted raw material logistics is still a challenge.

> **Implication:** This is a gap interview — still need to talk to OEM supply chain managers directly. André's indirect validation is useful social proof but not OEM-specific insight.

---

### 9. Generational Divide in Technology Adoption
André flagged a clear generational split: younger professionals embrace new tech; senior operators fear disruption to existing workflows. Successful adoption requires change management, not just technical integration.

> **Implication:** Product design should support gradual migration (don't force "all or nothing" adoption). Offer dashboards and exception-based workflows that align with how experienced operators already work.

---

### 10. André is Open to Follow-Up (via LinkedIn)
André confirmed he is open to being contacted again and offered to connect via LinkedIn (his email is changing post-MSC). He may also provide referrals to supply chain contacts.

> **Action:** Connect/follow up on LinkedIn within 2 weeks with a concise 2-line summary of progress and a specific ask (referral or follow-up question).

## Hypothesis Validation Summary

| Hypothesis | Status | André's Input |
|---|---|---|
| H1 — Spare part supply chain is inefficient across the fleet | ✅ Validated | Centralised procurement but improvised ship-to-ship distribution |
| H2 — IoT data is not being acted on for predictive maintenance | ✅ Validated | "Still early days… people still use Excel" |
| H3 — Data quality is the blocker for AI/ML | ✅ Strongly Validated | "Quality of data in our industry is very poor" |
| H4 — Trust is the biggest barrier to ecosystem adoption | ✅ Strongly Validated | TradeLens cited as failure case |
| H5 — OEMs are conservative about IP | ⚠️ Not directly validated | André has no direct experience; indirect validation only |
| H6 — Post-COVID, companies want supply chain independence | ✅ Strongly Validated | Canada + tariff fragility cited directly |
| H7 — 3D printing is credible for on-site manufacture | ✅ Partially Validated | Analogy with made-to-order Europe production |

## Next Steps (from this interview)

1. **Connect with André on LinkedIn** within 2 weeks — send brief update on progress and ask for 1–2 referrals to OEM supply chain managers or maritime procurement heads.
2. **Re-pitch narrative**: lead with *supply chain resilience + on-demand localisation* (not 3D printing technology).
3. **Neutralise governance concern**: define AddManuChain's ownership/governance model as neutral — no single carrier or tech giant controlling the platform data.
4. **Prioritise OEM interviews**: André's gap is the gap in the hypothesis set — find 3–5 OEM supply chain or IP licensing contacts for Part 2 of interviews.
5. **Data quality angle**: add a "data quality improvement" value proposition to the platform description — AddManuChain creates a trusted, standardised inventory data layer.
6. **Exception-based UX**: design workflows that let operators work by exception (alert-driven), not by dashboard-staring — this directly addresses André's "people still use Excel" observation.
7. **Update Hypothesis Tracking Sheet** with validations from this interview.
