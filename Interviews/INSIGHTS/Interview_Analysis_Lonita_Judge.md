## KEY INSIGHTS

### 🔑 Insight #1 — Downtime Cost is $50K–$100K/Day (Validated)
When asked about the cost of part failure at sea, Adam was direct:

> *"We could say anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 [per day]. We can say it could be lost time."*

**Strategic value:** This is a real, quantified pain point confirmed by a 10-year ship captain and a maritime COO. Not theoretical — operator-level validation. For our pitch this number is confirmed: a single missing part can cost $50–100K/day.

---

### 🔑 Insight #2 — Their Inventory Strategy Is "Deduplication," Not Warehousing
The $30–50M inventory figure does NOT apply to Horizon Maritime. Their approach:

> *"We have Duplicate equipment. We have 2 engines that are the same, 3 generators, 4 thrusters — so we share spares across all identical units. We just need one per type, not one per unit."*

**Important calibration:** Horizon Maritime is a smaller operator that uses a smart deduplication strategy. Their critical parts list is much leaner than offshore platform operators (like Equinor/Bay du Nord). The $30–50M figure applies more to large offshore/energy platforms, not vessel fleets.

---

### 🔑 Insight #3 — DNV Monitors Equipment, Not Individual Parts
This is a critical certified insight:

> *"DNV normally keeps the vessel certified to operate. They'll monitor our planned maintenance and equipment... but they don't normally monitor parts. They do check that we have a critical parts inventory onboard — but that's pretty much as far as it goes."*

**Implication:** For maritime vessels, the certification regulatory burden is at the **vessel/equipment level**, not the **part level**. This lowers the AM certification barrier for vessels compared to offshore platforms — and validates non-OEM aftermarket parts as already acceptable in many cases.

---

### 🔑 Insight #4 — Non-OEM Parts Are Already Accepted (Within Specs)
Adam confirmed they regularly use non-OEM aftermarket parts:

> *"OEMs always recommend their own parts. But there are times we do get non-OEM parts. They don't come with a certificate per se, as they're not OEM, but they are within the specs of what we need when we do [the job]."*

**Implication:** If non-OEM parts at-spec are already acceptable, then AM parts at-spec (certified to LR or DNV) should be equally acceptable. The market is more permissive than originally assumed for non-critical vessel components.

---

### 🔑 Insight #5 — Lead Time / Remote Operations = The REAL Pain
When discussing Arctic/remote operations, both agreed this is where the platform has the highest value:

> **Lonita:** *"There are parts of the world we operate in like the Arctic, and it is not easy to get parts there."*
> **Adam:** *"Very difficult. Getting a repair person out there, trying to find an airport — it's definitely challenging."*

**And Lonita named the key use case trigger:**
> *"If there's a long lead time, that's when we run into the problems."*

**Strategic implication:** Lead time compression for remote/Arctic operations is the validated primary value proposition — not inventory cost reduction (which they handle via deduplication already).

---

### 🔑 Insight #6 — Conceptual Acceptance, But "In Theory" Concerns
Lonita's reaction to the digital inventory + on-site printing pitch:

> *"In theory, it sounds wonderful. And it definitely keeps costs down in some cases because we're not buying up in advance."*

But she flagged a concern about older vessels:
> *"For older tonnage, in some cases the components need to be specially machined — it may or may not work in that application."*

Adam's reaction was more positive and practical:
> *"A few amount of approvals required for that, but I think it's a pretty good idea."*

**Key concern:** Older ships need bespoke machined parts — AM may not cover those. **Counter:** Our platform targets non-critical/non-structural parts first. We're not going after custom-machined legacy components in Phase 1.

---

### 🔑 Insight #7 — KEY REFERRAL: Shipyard Contacts Offered 🎯
At the end of the interview, Lonita made a direct offer:

> *"I might have a couple of people at a shipyards that you can talk to — I can make that connection."*

**This is the most valuable output of this interview.** Shipyard contacts are prime-candidate Buyer + Builder nodes in the AddManuChain ecosystem (Irving Shipbuilding, Davie, etc.).

## HYPOTHESIS TESTING RESULTS

| Hypothesis | Result | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Downtime costs $50K–$100K/day | ✅ CONFIRMED | Adam Mars quote |
| $30–50M inventory exists on vessels | ⚠️ PARTIALLY — Only for large offshore platforms | Horizon uses deduplication |
| Lead time is the #1 pain for remote ops | ✅ CONFIRMED | Both speakers; Arctic example |
| Certification is a major barrier | ✅ CONFIRMED (approvals needed) | Both agreed; Adam specifically flagged |
| Non-OEM parts already acceptable at spec | ✅ CONFIRMED | Adam's direct statement |
| Digital inventory accepted in principle | ✅ "In theory, yes" | Lonita + Adam |
| AM for on-site printing makes sense to operators | ✅ PARTIALLY — "in theory" | Concern: older tonnage, approval burden |

## STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

1. **Refocus pitch language** from "reduce your inventory costs" → **"eliminate your lead time risk for remote/Arctic operations."** Horizon already solved inventory costs via deduplication. Their pain is lead time.

2. **Non-critical polymer + metal parts for vessels** is the right entry point. Adam asked: *"Things like a bearing?"* — exactly right. These are at-spec tolerances, don't require OEM certification, and could be printed on-site.

3. **The older vessel / bespoke machined parts objection** is real. Pre-build in the answer: "We start with standardized non-critical parts — bearings, brackets, fittings. We're not trying to reprint 30-year-old custom bilge pump shafts."

4. **Shipyard referral from Lonita is HIGH priority.** Shipyards are where OEMs, designers, builders, and buyers all intersect. This is the most critical follow-up from this interview.
