# Interview #21 — Analysis & Insights
## Arad Gharagozli — Founder & CEO, Galaxia Mission Systems
**Interview Date:** February 2026 (short session — follow-up scheduled ~2 weeks out)  
**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Aerospace/Space AM user, local NS founder, potential collaboration/referral)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This was a 15-minute conversation held under non-ideal conditions (Arad was driving and had back-to-back meetings), but it yielded sharp, honest feedback. **Galaxia already uses additive manufacturing**, Arad immediately understood the platform concept, re-framed it compellingly as "Airbnb for 3D printers," and validated the idea — but raised the single most important business-model challenge: **IP security and controlled goods access in aerospace/defence**. A full follow-up meeting is confirmed.

## ✅ Key Validations

### 1. AM is already used at Galaxia
> *"Yes. So to answer that question, yes, we do."*

Galaxia is an active AM user — making them a potential **buyer of printing capacity** on the platform, not just a reference contact.

### 2. Platform concept immediately understood and endorsed
> *"I think it's a great idea. I would use it."*

Arad grasped the concept faster than most O&G interviewees. He re-described it accurately as:
- **"Uber Eats for printers"** → showed where the nearest printer is, pick material type, upload model, get cost estimate
- Then upgraded: **"More like Airbnb"** → you can also list your own idle printer to earn revenue

This unprompted Airbnb re-framing is **the clearest articulation of the two-sided marketplace model** received to date. Use it in pitches.

### 3. Galaxia would list their own printer on the platform
> *"We just ordered one of those bamboo printers… we can also put our printer on that platform when we are not using it to get money from it."*

This confirms the **supply-side thesis**: companies with idle printers are willing to monetise downtime. Galaxia is a live example.

## ⚠️ Critical Challenge Raised: IP & Controlled Goods in Aerospace

This is the sharpest single piece of negative feedback from the aerospace segment to date.

> *"A lot of companies, but aerospace a bit more — they're very worried about IP. And in some cases, you're also getting into controlled goods. If you're printing a nozzle for a system that is a controlled good, people are not going to do that. They don't know who has access to the printer or who can see their product."*

> *"As a business, it might get a bit hard to use a platform like that… it will end up being like a kind of a pet project if you will."*

### What This Means

| Concern | Arad's Framing | AddManuChain Response (from transcript) |
|---|---|---|
| **IP leakage** | Unknown printer operator could copy design | Full audit log — every action recorded, every print logged |
| **Controlled goods** | Export/ITAR compliance risk | OEM + regulatory checkpoints before any print is authorised |
| **Access control** | Who has access to the file and the printer? | Platform acts as a locked pipeline — gate-controlled |

Mahmoud's in-call response was solid: Lloyd's Register engaged, platform logs every action, OEM + regulatory sign-off required at each step, chain breaks if any party refuses.

**Gap to address:** The aerospace/defence use case needs **certified, vetted printer operators** — not just any registered facility. Consider a tiered facility certification layer (analogous to ISO/AS9100) before pitching to aerospace buyers.

## 💡 Business Model Insight: The Differentiator Question

> *"What stops someone from building the same website with a bunch of extra things and running you out of business?"*

This is the moat question. Arad identified it in under 5 minutes. Key differentiators to sharpen before the follow-up:

1. **Regulatory integration** — OEM sign-off + Lloyd's/DNV approval baked into the workflow (not a feature, a gate)
2. **Canadian sovereign positioning** — data stays in Canada; relevant for defence
3. **First-mover network effects** — certified facilities, OEM agreements, and part libraries are hard to replicate quickly
4. **Sector-specific trust** — O&G and marine operators won't switch once certified; high switching cost

## 🤝 PolyUnity (Interview #53) — Cross-Validation

Mahmoud mentioned PolyUnity collaboration. Arad had not heard of them, but reacted positively to the idea of collaboration with a polymer-focused player. This is consistent with the PolyUnity (Stephen Ryan) conversation — both parties are open to it.

## 📋 Follow-Up Actions

- [ ] **Schedule follow-up via Leah** (Arad's assistant — CC her on reply email) — target Thursday ~2 weeks out
- [ ] **Prepare aerospace-specific version of the IP/controlled goods answer** before the next call
- [ ] **Ask in follow-up:** What certification standard does Galaxia use for AM parts? (CSA, ESA, DND?)
- [ ] **Ask:** Would Galaxia list their Bambu printer as a facility on a pilot version of the platform?
- [ ] **Ask:** Are there other NS/Atlantic Canada aerospace contacts Arad would refer?
- [ ] **Ask:** Does Galaxia have defence-contract work that falls under controlled goods — and if so, what would make a platform trustworthy enough to use for those parts?

## 📊 Hypothesis Updates

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AM is actively used in aerospace/space sector | ✅ CONFIRMED | Galaxia uses AM in production |
| Two-sided marketplace model is intuitive | ✅ CONFIRMED | Arad independently described Airbnb model |
| IP / controlled goods = #1 aerospace barrier | ✅ NEW VALIDATION | Arad: "people are not going to do that" without trust infrastructure |
| Idle printers can be monetised | ✅ CONFIRMED | Galaxia willing to list their own printer |
| Platform audit trail addresses IP concern | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Arad acknowledged it but not fully convinced — need stronger vetting layer |

## 🗣️ Key Quotes

> *"I think it's a great idea. I would use it."*

> *"It's like Airbnb for 3D printers — you can rent someone's printer, or if you have your own and you're not using it, you can put it out there for your downtime to make money."*

> *"They're very worried about IP. And in some cases you're getting into controlled goods. People are not going to do that — they don't know who has access to it."*

> *"You're doing a great job doing your customer discovery."*

## ⭐ Overall Assessment

**Arad is a high-value contact.** He's an active AM user, a local NS founder, gave the clearest product articulation of any interviewee to date, and raised the most pointed aerospace-specific challenge. The follow-up call will be significantly more structured than this first session and has strong potential to yield referrals into the NS aerospace/defence ecosystem.
