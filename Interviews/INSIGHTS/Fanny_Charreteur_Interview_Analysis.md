## Key Data Points (PRIMA Québec Survey)

### Survey Methodology
- **Sample:** 39 responses from 146 organizations contacted (27% response rate)
- **Sector:** Advanced materials (includes AM, composites, metallurgy, etc.)
- **Limitation:** Only 1 respondent directly active in additive manufacturing
- **Validity:** Representative of broader advanced materials ecosystem

### Technology Adoption Rates

| Technology Type | Adoption Rate |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Digital Tools** | 77% |
| **AI/Machine Learning** | 60% |
| **Interest in New Technologies** | ~100% |
| **Adopted new tech in past 5 years** | Majority |

### Barriers to Technology Adoption

| Barrier | Frequency Cited |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Investment Costs** | 89% |
| **Uncertainty regarding ROI** | 55% |
| **Workforce Shortages** | 32% |
| **Lack of Support/Guidance** | 21% |

> **Key Insight:** These barriers apply equally—if not **more strongly**—to digital, on-demand inventory systems.

### Digital Transformation Offensive Program Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total companies in advanced materials sector** | 619 |
| **Companies benefiting from Digital Transformation program** | ~20% |
| **Implied non-participants** | ~80% |

**Interpretation:** Combination of:
- Limited awareness of programs
- Limited perceived relevance
- Limited readiness for digital transformation

---

## Strategic Insights

### 1. **Québec Companies Face Significant Digital Adoption Lag**

> *"I tend to think that Québec companies still face a significant lag in digital adoption, and the additive manufacturing sector appears to face challenges similar to those encountered across the broader advanced materials ecosystem."*

**Implication for Lab2Market:**
- Market education is a prerequisite to sales
- Early adopters will be minority (~20%)
- Government programs exist but awareness is low

### 2. **Investment Cost is the Dominant Barrier (89%)**

This aligns with previous interviews:
- **OMV Austria (Chris):** Required 15% ROI proof
- **Nicole Rathie (NGen):** "Wait-and-see" posture due to economic uncertainty
- **Jean-Michel Fortin (Agnico):** Cost justification challenge for AM

**Action:** Value proposition must lead with ROI quantification, not technology features.

### 3. **ROI Uncertainty is Second Barrier (55%)**

Companies cannot quantify the return on digital inventory investments because:
- No clear benchmarks exist
- Use cases are theoretical, not proven
- Risk of stranded investment

**Action:** Develop case studies with measurable outcomes (e.g., "reduced downtime by X hours," "saved $Y in expedited shipping").

### 4. **Workforce Shortage is Real Constraint (32%)**

Even if companies want to adopt, they lack:
- Skilled AM operators
- Data analysts for AI/ML
- Change management capacity

**Action:** Position platform as reducing workforce burden (AI automation, simple UX), not adding complexity.

### 5. **Only 20% of Companies Engage with Government Programs**

80% of potential customers are either:
- Unaware of support available
- Don't see relevance
- Not ready for transformation

**Action:** Partner with ecosystem orchestrators (PRIMA, NGen, Canada Makes) to reach the 80%.

## Hypothesis Validation

### Hypothesis: "Manufacturing companies are actively seeking digital solutions for inventory management"

| Status | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | 77% have adopted digital tools, 60% AI/ML. Interest is high (~100%). |
| **BUT NUANCED** | Adoption ≠ digital inventory specifically. Barriers remain significant. |

### Hypothesis: "Cost is the primary barrier to AM/digital inventory adoption"

| Status | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **STRONGLY VALIDATED** | 89% cite investment costs as barrier. 55% cite ROI uncertainty. |
| **Implication** | Value proposition must be financial-first, not technology-first. |

### Hypothesis: "Companies lack awareness of digital transformation opportunities"

| Status | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **VALIDATED** | Only 20% engaged with government digital transformation programs. 80% are either unaware or not ready. |

## Comparison with Other Interviews

| Source | Key Finding | Alignment with Fanny |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Nicole Rathie (NGen)** | "Wait-and-see" posture | ✅ Matches "lag in digital adoption" |
| **Chris (OMV)** | 15% ROI requirement | ✅ Matches 89% citing investment costs |
| **Jean-Michel Fortin** | Volume doesn't justify AM | ✅ Matches ROI uncertainty barrier |
| **Harvey Doane** | "Sell what they're buying" | ✅ Need to frame in customer terms |
| **Lee Vessey** | Focus on "breakdown insurance" | ✅ Concrete value prop reduces ROI uncertainty |

## Actionable Takeaways

### 1. **Lead with Financial Value Proposition**
- Don't sell "digital inventory" or "AM platform"
- Sell "reduce inventory carrying costs by 30%"
- Sell "avoid $500K/day downtime with on-demand parts"

### 2. **Develop Proof Points**
- Case studies with quantified ROI
- Pilot programs with measurable outcomes
- Reference customers who can speak to results

### 3. **Partner with Ecosystem Orchestrators**
- PRIMA Québec (advanced materials)
- NGen Canada (manufacturing)
- Canada Makes (AM specifically)
- Regional EDOs

### 4. **Address Workforce Barrier in Design**
- Platform must be simple to use (no AM expertise required)
- AI should automate decisions (stock vs. print)
- Training/support included in offer

### 5. **Target the 20% Early Adopters First**
- Companies already engaged with digital transformation programs
- Companies with innovation mandates
- Companies with recent technology adoption track record

## Thank-You Email Draft

**Subject:** Re: Thank You - Valuable Ecosystem Insights

Dear Fanny,

Thank you so much for taking the time to share these ecosystem-level insights from PRIMA Québec's research. The survey data on technology adoption barriers is exactly the kind of evidence I needed to validate my market assumptions.

The finding that 89% of companies cite investment costs as a barrier—combined with only 20% engaging with digital transformation programs—confirms that market education and ROI proof will be essential before any technology adoption can occur.

I particularly appreciated your observation that the AM sector faces challenges similar to those across the broader advanced materials ecosystem. This suggests my focus should be on solving the universal barriers (cost, ROI uncertainty, workforce) rather than AM-specific features.

If you're open to it, I'd welcome the opportunity to stay connected as my research progresses. Your ecosystem perspective is invaluable.

Best regards,  
Mahmoud Kiasari  
PhD Candidate, Dalhousie University

## Raw Response (Preserved)

> Dear Mr. Kiasari,
>
> Thank you for reaching out. Your research topic on digital inventory management and the AM supply chain is very timely, particularly in the context of highly regulated industries.
>
> While I cannot speak specifically for Québec-based additive manufacturing companies alone, I can share some recent ecosystem-level insights that may be relevant to your requirement analysis phase.
>
> Earlier this year, PRIMA Québec conducted a survey among their members to better understand their perspective on technology adoption. They received 39 responses out of 146 organizations contacted; only one respondent was directly active in additive manufacturing, but the dataset is representative of the broader advanced materials sector. Nearly all respondents expressed interest in adopting new technologies, and a majority reported having adopted new technologies within the past five years. Specifically, 77% reported adopting digital tools, and 60% reported adoption of AI or machine learning technologies.
>
> When asked about barriers to technology adoption, the most frequently cited challenges were investment costs (89%), uncertainty regarding return on investment (55%), workforce shortages (32%), and lack of adequate support or guidance (21%). These barriers would likely apply equally—if not more strongly—to a transition toward digital, on-demand inventory systems.
>
> In addition, by cross-referencing our internal database with data from Québec's Digital Transformation Offensive program, we observed that only about 20% of companies in the advanced materials sector (out of a total of 619) have benefited from this initiative. This suggests a combination of limited awareness and, in some cases, limited perceived relevance or readiness for digital transformation.
>
> Based on these observations, I tend to think that Québec companies still face a significant lag in digital adoption, and the additive manufacturing sector appears to face challenges similar to those encountered across the broader advanced materials ecosystem.
