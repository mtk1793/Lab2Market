## Core Strategic Insights

### 1. **Global Visibility is Broken — Parts are Duplicated Across Regions Unknown**

**Craig's Direct Quote:**
> *"We could stock the same part right? Multiple regions across the world and not actually know what other organizations have it. When we get into a pinch, let's say and we need something because we've stocked out one location, and we need to, we could potentially get it from another location. We don't have good lineup sight to that today."*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **The problem is real.** ExxonMobil is a $400B+ company with global operations; if they lack visibility across regions, every other operator struggles with it.
- **This is a **billion-dollar inefficiency**: Multiple $10k-$100k+ parts warehoused redundantly across 50+ global facilities, with zero cross-visibility.
- **Your digital inventory platform directly solves this.** But not as your primary pitch — visibility alone doesn't compel adoption at enterprise. The *actionability* of that visibility (i.e., "we found the part 2,000 miles away, now what?") is what drives decision-making.

**What to do with this:**
- Lead with **"Cross-facility parts sharing + on-demand fulfillment"** narrative, not just visibility.
- Build case study frame: *"Global O&G operator discovers $5M/year in duplicated inventory through digital visibility; redirects capital to strategic reserves."*

### 2. **Manual Intervention is Massive — Systems-of-Systems Integration is the Bottleneck**

**Craig's Direct Quote:**
> *"There's a significant amount of manual intervention today because we are spread across multiple systems. Whenever a systematic process doesn't work, it requires that human work or a human intervention. That could be something as simple as updating a delivery date from vendor... all the way through to the transmission of POs or other types of orders... which is then creating supply chain disruption if we don't have a mechanism to track those."*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **The integration problem is structural, not just technical.** ExxonMobil runs SAP (financials) + TM (transportation) + EWM (warehousing) + external vendor systems. None of these talk seamlessly.
- **When POs don't reach the right vendor, or vendor updates don't reach end-users, supply chain breaks.**
- **Your platform's killer feature isn't the software UI — it's the ability to orchestrate across these fragmented systems.**

**What to do with this:**
1. **Design for API-first architecture** — your platform must connect SAP, TM, EWM, and external AM facility systems without forcing re-platforming.
2. **Use "Reduces manual intervention by 60-80%" as a key metric** when pitching to operations teams.
3. **Your actual sales motion isn't "Buy our digital inventory software" — it's "We reduce the manual handoffs between your SAP, vendor systems, and execution layer."**

### 3. **MRO Supply Chains Are Unsophisticated — "Last-Minute Supply Chain" Creates Pressure**

**Craig's Direct Quote:**
> *"In the MRO supply chain, we are not as sophisticated as that [SNP process]. Because of that, there are lots of scenarios where... it's almost like a last-minute supply chain, which creates a lot of pressure because we either don't have the right materials in the warehouse, the lead time in the system is not accurate enough."*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Operations) supply chains are reactive, not predictive.** Even at a company ExxonMobil's scale.
- **Lead-time data is wrong.** Operators order "direct" without reliable lead-time visibility, creating false urgency and emergency procurement.
- **This is exactly where AM + digital inventory wins.** You're solving the reactive-to-proactive transition.

**What to do with this:**
1. **Position your platform as "From Reactive to Predictive MRO."**
2. **Your integration with classification societies (Lloyd's, DNV) + AM facilities gives ExxonMobil the lead-time confidence they're missing.**
3. **Use this quote in demand-gen:** *"Even enterprise operators rely on 'last-minute' MRO decisions. What if you could plan 2 weeks ahead instead of 2 hours?"*

### 4. **Enterprise IT Risk is a Gating Factor — Data Security, Privacy, Compliance are Non-Negotiable**

**Craig's Direct Quote:**
> *"Everything has to go through an IT risk process where we work intimately with a software provider to make sure that all of our data is housed properly. There are a lot of IT risk and database applications and data privacy scenarios that we would have to go through today."*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **You cannot sell to ExxonMobil without passing their IT risk process.** This includes data residency, encryption, audit logs, access controls.
- **Don't try to "move fast and break things" with enterprise customers.** The IT risk review can take 6-12 months.
- **But once approved, switching costs are very high** (new platform would need new IT risk review).

**What to do with this:**
1. **Build security/compliance into your MVP, not as an afterthought.**
2. **Get SOC 2 Type II compliance before enterprise pitching.**
3. **Design for data isolation per customer** (ExxonMobil's data never touches other customers' data or external vendors).
4. **Plan for IT risk review timeline in your sales cycle** — don't promise 90-day implementation to enterprise; plan for 6-9 month sales cycle including IT approval.

### 5. **Digital Readiness Scaling is the Core Problem — It's Not Just CAD Files**

**Craig's Direct Quote (Critical):**
> *"How do you scale that digital readiness in a way that you do not have to spend a disproportionate amount of money getting that image ready? Getting to DRL 3 is not easy because of all the other things that need to be layered on more than just the scan. But the heat treatment and all the other quality pieces that are required to make a part actually ready to be out of the manufactured."*

**Implication for AddManuChain — This is Your Core Value Prop:**
- **The real barrier to AM adoption at enterprise isn't "Can we print it?" — it's "Can we do it affordably and with quality confidence?"**
- **Digital Readiness Levels (DRL) are the standard:**
  - DRL 1: Initial concept
  - DRL 2: Design + basic validation
  - DRL 3: **Full manufacturing-ready design + materials data + heat treatment + QA protocols**
- **Getting to DRL 3 requires:** CAD model → materials analysis → stress analysis → heat-treat specs → inspection protocols → quality assurance → certification.
- **Current problem:** Each part requires custom engineering work to reach DRL 3. That's expensive ($10k-$50k per part) and slow (3-6 months).
- **Your platform's job:** Create a reusable, pre-certified library that amortizes DRL 3 cost across 100+ operators using the same part family.

**What to do with this:**
1. **Your pre-certified parts library is your defensible moat.** Once Lloyd's certifies a part design, that certification is reusable across all your customers globally.
2. **Position as "We amortize DRL 3 cost across our network."** Instead of one operator spending $50k to certify a part, 10 operators share that cost (you take 20-30%, they share the rest).
3. **This is why working with classification societies (Lloyd's, DNV) is existential** — they validate once, you scale globally.
4. **Your AI/data analytics layer** (which you mentioned in the conversation) should focus on: predicting which part families will have the highest adoption across your customer base, so you prioritize those for pre-certification.

### 6. **Use-Case Specificity is Critical — Not All Parts Should Be AM**

**Craig's Direct Quote:**
> *"Just because an item can be manufactured digitally or through additive manufacturing doesn't mean that you actually should adopt additive manufacturing in the part right?"*

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **Enterprise customers will challenge "Why should we AM this part?" — and they're right to.**
- **Your platform needs to encode decision rules:** "This part is suitable for AM if: [lead time > X weeks] AND [annual demand > Y units] AND [criticality = non-flight-critical] AND [geometry enables cost savings]."
- **You're not selling "print everything" — you're selling "print the right things, fast, cheap, certified."**

**What to do with this:**
1. **Build a "Part Readiness for AM" decision engine** into your platform.
2. **Encode industry standards** (military specs like MMPDS for aerospace, similar frameworks for O&G, maritime, industrial).
3. **Use this engine to differentiate from competitors** — FieldNode has digital inventory; you have "Is this part AM-suitable + certified + cost-optimized?"
