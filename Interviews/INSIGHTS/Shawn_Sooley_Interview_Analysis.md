## Executive Summary

This interview with Shawn Sooley, CEO & sole owner of Shield Group of Companies, was a **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXTRAORDINARY** interview — arguably the most strategically valuable conversation to date. Shawn is not a passive industry observer — he is an **active AM practitioner** who is already manufacturing industrial parts (valve stems, food processing components) for real clients using additive. He delivered **brutal honesty** on multiple fronts: why operators won't pursue certification themselves ("they're never going to do that"), why selling AI is a mistake, why academic credibility alone won't gain traction, and — most critically — offered the **"Aerospace First" certification strategy** that could unlock the entire O&G market.

### Key Validation Metrics:
- ✅ **Spare parts pain STRONGLY validated**: "It's much more obvious in Newfoundland than anywhere else"
- ✅ **AM perception barrier confirmed**: Seen as "toy solution, not industrial solution"
- ✅ **Certification barrier REFRAMED**: Lloyd's/DNV are not the enemy — operators' FEAR of extra work is the enemy
- ✅ **Digital inventory need confirmed**: "I have a model already established for effectively what you were talking about"
- ⚠️ **AI sell REJECTED**: "I think you're going to have a really hard sell with selling AI"
- 🆕 **"Aerospace First" strategy**: Hardest certification first → O&G becomes easy by comparison
- 🆕 **Industry credibility gap identified**: "If you don't have a problem solver from the space, you will have trouble"
- 🎯 **PARTNERSHIP POTENTIAL**: Shawn has the industry credibility, AM capability, and client base AddManuChain needs

**Interview Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **EXTRAORDINARY** — Active AM manufacturer, class society expert, brutal honesty, potential partner

## Deep Dive Analysis

### 1. The Invisible Pain: "They Don't Know It's a Problem That Can Be Solved" 🔍

#### What Shawn Said:
> "People are creatures of opportunity and they really don't know to complain about it because they've always kind of faced those challenges. They've always had these problems. And it's just been known that that's the way the world is so **they don't know that it's a problem that can be solved.**"

> "They talk about it as if it's **fairytale, not as if it's a real solution.**"

> "Most people see things like additive manufacturing as a **toy solution, not an industrial solution.**"

#### Critical Insights:
1. **The pain is real but INVISIBLE** — operators have normalized the problem
2. **Three-layer perception barrier**:
   - Layer 1: "That's just how it is" → Don't see it as solvable
   - Layer 2: "AM is a toy" → Don't believe AM is industrial-grade
   - Layer 3: "Regulators will block it" → Fear of certification complexity
3. **Demand exists but is unexpressed** — "They express that it would be great if the option was there"
4. **Newfoundland is the worst case** — "Much more obvious in Newfoundland than anywhere else"

#### Strategic Implications:
- 🆕 **Don't ask operators about their problem — SHOW them the solution works** (they can't articulate what they don't believe exists)
- ✅ **Validates "education" as critical go-to-market activity** — must demonstrate, not just pitch
- 🎯 **Newfoundland = best beachhead** — pain is highest, logistics worst, AM benefit most obvious
- ⚠️ **Risk**: If you pitch abstractly, operators will politely dismiss — need live demonstration

### 2. The "3D Printer as Photocopier" Vision 🖨️

#### What Shawn Said:
> "I think that at some point **a 3D printer will be as common in most places as your copier.** Your photocopier. However, I don't think that everybody's going to want to be able to go ahead and jump in and use that."

> "You are now **one man parts catalog with a well-defined and managed inventory catalog.** You have the understanding of how long it's going to take us to get these parts realistically."

> "Those things are easy. I mean, you give any millwright a 40 minute tutorial on even a more advanced machine, he will figure out everything with that machine if he has any CNC background. **But what he doesn't have is CAD experience, he doesn't have the understanding of how things work from a geometry perspective, from a material science perspective.**"

#### Critical Insights:
1. **Hardware is NOT the barrier** — machines are cheap, easy to operate
2. **Knowledge is the barrier** — CAD, material science, geometry, application engineering
3. **"One Man Parts Catalog"** concept — a single person per site who:
   - Manages digital inventory catalog
   - Understands what can/can't be printed
   - Knows print times and material requirements
   - Manages filament/material stock
4. **Exxon already has 3D printers on rigs** — Markforged/Onyx — but underutilizes them massively

#### Strategic Implications:
- 🆕 **AddManuChain's real product = the KNOWLEDGE layer, not the hardware**
- 🎯 **Service model**: Provide the "one man parts catalog" as a managed service — operators don't need to hire/train internally
- ✅ **Validates platform concept**: Digital catalog + material science expertise + application engineering
- 🆕 **Exxon data point**: Already has Markforged printers on rigs but doesn't fully utilize them → opportunity for managed AM service

---

### 3. Class Societies REFRAMED: "Your Biggest Adversary Is Extra Work" ⚖️

#### What Shawn Said:
> "**They're not going to do that. They're never going to do that.** I will do that. You will do it. Someone — one of us, someone like us will do that."

> "**DNV and Lloyd's are not an insurance company. DNV and Lloyd's are not the police, they're not the regulator.** DNV and Lloyd's technically **work for ExxonMobil**, for Suncor, for Equinor. They work for the oil and gas company. Their job is to ensure that they are compliant."

> "**Work — generally speaking — is your biggest adversary.** And not your work, someone else having feared that they're going to have to do more work."

> "A lot of time, it's either **assumptions or trickle-down information that they don't really fully understand.** And they just assumed that you also don't understand."

#### Critical Insights:
1. **Operators will NEVER pursue AM certification themselves** — someone else must do it for them
2. **Class societies are NOT the enemy** — they're service providers to operators, not regulators
3. **Real barrier = FEAR OF EXTRA WORK** — operators resist because AM = more compliance paperwork
4. **"Lloyd's problem" is usually misattributed** — operators don't know if it's Lloyd's, insurance, C-NLOPB, or Transport Canada
5. **Shawn's Project Survey experience**: He'd prep everything → DNV surveyor shows up, gets a binder, turns around and leaves
6. **Key insight**: "Two weeks of our time is less than 10 hours of his" — preparation is the real work

#### Certification Reality Map (from Shawn):
```
Operator says: "Lloyd's will have a problem"
Reality: They DON'T KNOW who will have a problem
Actual breakdown:
├── Lloyd's/DNV → Compliance certification (THEY WORK FOR THE OPERATOR)
├── Insurance → Liability coverage
├── C-NLOPB/CNOR → Offshore regulator
├── Transport Canada → Marine/vessel regulator
└── ISO standards → Compliance framework

The REAL barrier: Nobody wants extra work to figure this out.
THE OPPORTUNITY: Do the work FOR them.
```

#### Strategic Implications:
- 🆕 **AddManuChain's KILLER FEATURE: "We handle the certification so you don't have to"**
- 🎯 **Business model**: Charge a premium for "compliance-ready" AM parts — operators gladly pay to avoid the work
- ✅ **Validates "certification as a service" concept** — do the prep work like Project Survey did for vessels
- ⚠️ **Reframe pitch**: Don't say "we'll help you get certified" — say "we've already handled compliance"

---

### 4. The "Aerospace First" Strategy 🚀✈️

#### What Shawn Said:
> "The most difficult regulatory body you will ever face is going to be **aerospace.** No question. Aerospace also has the most appetite."

> "**You break through to the aerospace world and you approach Exxon and say, hey, listen I want to do this thing.** They say, okay, well, the regulator's going to be there. Don't worry about it. We already do aerospace work, a ton of it. **You really think your rules are going to be more stringent than aerospace? No, certainly not.**"

> "The invisible barrier of Lloyd's is going to get in my way... **that goes away. It's gone.**"

#### Critical Insights:
1. **Aerospace = hardest certification** → If you pass aerospace, O&G is easy by comparison
2. **Aerospace = most appetite** → They actually WANT AM (unlike O&G operators who are passive)
3. **Credibility transfer**: Aerospace certification credibility instantly removes O&G operator objections
4. **PEEK is the golden material** — aerospace won't talk to you unless you can print PEEK
5. **Vertical burn test** — hardest physical test to achieve for AM materials
6. **Provincial Aerospace** — Shawn already has a relationship, working toward additive orders

#### The Strategy:
```
Step 1: Achieve aerospace AM certification (hardest)
Step 2: Approach O&G with aerospace credentials  
Step 3: O&G objection ("Lloyd's won't like it") instantly dissolved
Step 4: "You think YOUR rules are more stringent than aerospace? No."
Step 5: Conversation opens up — barrier eliminated
```

#### Strategic Implications:
- 🆕 **GAME-CHANGING STRATEGY**: Pursue aerospace certification FIRST, then pivot to O&G
- 🎯 **Material focus**: Must develop PEEK printing capability (or materials that exceed PEEK specs)
- ✅ **Validates "hardest first" approach** — contradicts instinct to start easy
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Aerospace certification is expensive and time-consuming — but ROI is massive
- 🆕 **ITB Program** (Industrial Technological Benefits) — government driver for aerospace contracts

### 5. Don't Sell AI — Sell the Solution 🤖❌

#### What Shawn Said:
> "**That's not new.** We've been using things like Tan Delta machines to utilize predictive maintenance for years."

> "If you go online and punch in predictive maintenance, you're going to get off-the-shelf software all over the place."

> "**I think you're going to have a really hard sell with selling AI.** You need to give a solution."

> "People are afraid to buy things that are AI driven for 2 reasons."

#### Two Reasons AI Is Hard to Sell:
1. **Value perception problem**: AI makes work "too easy" → customers feel overcharged for AI-generated solutions vs. extensive manual work
2. **Obsolescence fear**: "Maybe I'll wait to see what happens in another month" → AI changes so fast that buyers perpetually defer purchase, expecting a cheaper/better AI solution next month

#### What To Do Instead:
> "**What I would make my selling point is that I understand a struggle. Or I understand a gap in the market. I understand a problem that can be solved. And you have the solution.** Sure, maybe you utilize AI or AI has made it possible for you to do that. But don't sell the AI."

#### Strategic Implications:
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL PIVOT**: Remove "AI" from the headline pitch — make it a feature, not the product
- 🎯 **Reframe**: "We solve spare parts downtime in remote operations" NOT "We use AI for predictive maintenance"
- ✅ **Validates problem-first selling** — operators care about outcomes, not technology
- 🆕 **Predictive maintenance already exists** (Tan Delta, off-the-shelf software) — not novel enough to differentiate

---

### 6. Industry Credibility Gap: "Attach Yourself to Someone" 🤝

#### What Shawn Said:
> "**Get yourself someone from the industry.** The only way to gain credibility."

> "**This is not a service. This is just a tool and a tool belt.** If you don't have a problem solver from the space you will have trouble gaining traction. Because your **credibility's not been established.** And in order to establish credibility, you have to be background."

> "**My advice is attach yourself to someone that's in whatever your biggest target industry is** and ideally someone who is attached to multiple of the sectors."

#### The Atlantic XL Cautionary Tale:
- Atlantic XL pushed hard for AM parts — **couldn't gain traction**
- Shawn bought a $499 Bambu A1 Mini for his garage
- Atlantic XL's target clients came to Shawn instead because **he already solved their problems** daily
- The difference: **industry credibility** — Shawn is a known problem-solver, Atlantic XL is an unknown AM company

#### Strategic Implications:
- 🆕 **SHAWN SOOLEY IS THE IDEAL INDUSTRY PARTNER** — he has:
  - ✅ Multi-sector exposure (offshore, marine, mining, manufacturing, food processing)
  - ✅ Active AM practice with real paying clients
  - ✅ Class society expertise (Project Survey background)
  - ✅ Aerospace entry (Provincial Aerospace relationship)
  - ✅ Industrial credibility (scaffolder, insulator, HEO — trades background)
  - ✅ Already doing inventory management for his products
- 🎯 **Action**: Explore partnership with Shield Group as industry credibility anchor
- ⚠️ **Warning for AddManuChain**: Without industry partner, risk repeating Atlantic XL's traction problem

### 7. Shawn's Existing AM Business — Organic Growth Model 🌱

#### What Shawn Said:
> "I went out and I bought a $499 A1 Mini to make gadgets for my garage. And the people that Atlantic XL were going to try to gain some traction with, came to me with a toy and said, 'hey, I need you to make me some things.'"

> "I just finished making a **stem for this valve** the other day. **Food processing facilities** come to me and say, 'hey, listen, we need 20 of these things. Can you make it? **And maybe can you make it better than what the other thing was?**'"

> "**There's no way that I could keep up if I did all of the work for all of the clients** that I currently work for with my other services. There's no possible way to keep up."

> "**I have a model already established for effectively, what you were talking about doing.**"

#### Critical Insights:
1. **Organic demand is real** — Shawn didn't seek AM clients, they came to him
2. **He's capacity-constrained** — can't serve all the demand with current setup
3. **Already doing digital inventory management** for Shield Group's insulation products
4. **"Hybridize" inventory management** — standalone inventory management won't work, needs integration with AM capability
5. **Product improvement requests**: Clients ask "can you make it better?" → design optimization opportunity

#### Strategic Implications:
- 🎯 **Shawn has product-market fit ALREADY** — just can't scale
- 🆕 **AddManuChain could be Shawn's scaling partner** — platform handles catalog/inventory, Shawn handles manufacturing
- ✅ **Validates the business model** — real customers paying for real AM parts
- 🆕 **Food processing** = unexpected market segment with AM demand (not just O&G!)

## 🏆 Interview Rating: Why This Is #1

This interview stands apart from all others because Shawn Sooley is the **only interviewee who is BOTH**:
1. An **active AM practitioner** with paying industrial clients, AND
2. A **class society expert** who understands the certification system from the inside

He is not theorizing about AM's potential — he is living it. His insights carry the weight of direct experience, not speculation. The "Aerospace First" strategy alone could redefine AddManuChain's entire go-to-market approach.

**Recommendation:** Shawn Sooley should be considered as a **strategic advisor or industry partner**, not just an interviewee.
