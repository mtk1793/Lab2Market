## Company Overview: The Assembly Studio

### Status:
- **Founded:** October 2025 (pilot phase)
- **Stage:** Very early - only 4 months old
- **Focus:** Secure digital inventory platform for Canadian manufacturing

### Core Value Proposition:
1. **Digital Inventory:** Convert physical warehouse stock to digital design files
2. **IP Security:** Secure warehousing and transport of design files (their differentiator)
3. **Canadian Ecosystem Building:** Addressing 10-year lag behind Europe/US

### What They're Building:

**Technology Stack (Dustin's Design):**
- **Local Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5 boards at each manufacturing site (3-4 boards per site)
- **Encrypted Storage:** Files stored encrypted on-site at manufacturing location
- **Physical Pass Keys:** Highest security level for sensitive IP
- **No Cloud Strategy:** Avoiding US/Canadian/Chinese clouds for security
- **Decentralized Architecture:** Each site has local hardware; redundancy built in
- **AI Integration (Future):** Raspberry Pi 5 AI hat for visual QA, failure detection
- **Automation Focus:** Robots, automated plate handling, preventive maintenance scheduling

**Security Model:**
- Multiple security levels (some clients don't care, others require maximum protection)
- Encrypted file transfer between sites
- **Goal:** "A human cannot access the file" - fully automated secure workflow
- Currently no encrypted path from local server → printer (identified gap)

## Key Insights & Quotes

### 1. Customer Adoption Patterns

**Quote (Dustin):**
> "Almost everyone we talk to knows things need to be different. They don't have a concept of what that should be. They just know that their supply chain doesn't work."

**Quote (Nichelle):**
> "When you suggest the idea, they're like, 'oh yeah, that would solve everything.' They get really excited about it, they see it can be a solution, but their awareness of additive manufacturing in Canada is **almost zero**."

**Market Sizing Data:**
- **90%+ of companies** understand supply chain needs improvement
- **Huge leap** from awareness → solution adoption
- **Conversion process:** Education required, but appetite exists

---

### 2. IP Security as Primary Barrier

**Quote (Nichelle):**
> "Digital inventory is a cool idea and **everyone's worried about protecting their IP**, so no one wants to really do it."

**Quote (Dustin):**
> "The thing I was surprised about is **how concerned they were with security**. I didn't think that was as big a concern."

**Case Study - PEI Client:**
- Had designs "ripped off" by manufacturer in Europe
- **No recourse** available
- This validates IP protection as a real, urgent problem

**Aligns with Jim Granger's feedback:**
> "The hurdle I would see is a lot of companies don't want to share IP. It doesn't matter how strong the NDA is." (15 years at GE taught him this)

---

### 3. Digital Inventory Understanding vs. Implementation Gap

**Quote (Nichelle):**
> "Digital inventory is **pretty well understood**, but the implementation is not really there. And we're still kind of teasing out why that is."

**What's Missing:**
1. **Standardization** - No standards across industries
2. **Trust** - Zero percent chance of IP leakage required
3. **Implementation tools** - Gap between concept and execution

**Their Solution Focus:**
- NOT creating digital inventory (that's understood)
- Creating **secure warehousing, transport, and IP protection**
- Making it "aimless and transparent to the company" - they care about price, time, security

---

### 4. Customer Priorities: Cost, Time, Security

**Quote (Dustin):**
> "**Cost, time, security**. I mean, each company is different, but that's what I'm hearing."

**Customer Segmentation by Priority:**

| Customer Type | Primary Priority | Characteristics |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Big Companies (Tier 1)** | Time (but have deep pockets) | Don't care about $500K-$1M/day costs, slow to move |
| **Small Companies (Tier 2/3)** | Cost + Time | Speed is differentiator, can't afford delays |
| **Consumer-Facing** | Time (reputation) | Delays damage customer service reputation |

**Mahmoud's Oil & Gas Example:**
- Company: $500M-$1B vessels
- Physical inventory: $50M stock
- Downtime: $500K-$1M/day
- Response: **"Who cares. We don't care. We have deep pockets."**

**Nichelle's Response:**
> "For larger companies, they just move slower. They have workflows that work for them. They have more invested."

**Dustin's Strategy:**
> "I don't care. The very next day, I would go find their **biggest competitors that are the smallest**. Those dinosaurs aren't gonna move until the market forces them to. We have to start pushing it, and they have to see it happening."

---

### 5. Europe 10+ Years Ahead of Canada

**Quote (Nichelle):**
> "The Canadian ecosystem for additive manufacturing is probably **10 years behind** what it should be."

**Mahmoud's Supporting Data:**
- **Baker Hughes** (German company) already built digital inventory platform for oil & gas
- 80 years in business, deep OEM connections, established trust
- Operating successfully in Europe
- Limited Canadian presence (had one Toronto project)

**Quote (Dustin):**
> "A lot of the technology we're choosing - the companies are based in **France and Germany**. A lot of AI, a lot of additive manufacturing. I'm trying to stay away from any US or Chinese clouds."

**Market Implication:**
- Canada is isolated from European AM advances
- Need to catch up fast
- European competitors have 10-year head start

---

### 6. Old School Resistance ("Dinosaurs")

**Pattern Identified:**
- Mining company: "We don't like 3D printing, we don't like digital inventory, we have our stock, we don't care about you"
- Oil & gas: "This is how we always did it... we'll figure it out"
- Larger companies more resistant than smaller ones

**Quote (Dustin - Internal AI Bot):**
> "Every decision about today's manufacturers was made in the 70s, and those people are smarter than you. They just got there first."

**Approach:**
- Don't waste time convincing dinosaurs
- Target their **smallest competitors** who need speed/cost advantages
- Market forces will eventually move the giants

---

### 7. Regulations & Standards Lag Behind Technology

**Quote (Mahmoud):**
> "Digital inventory and 3D printing technology have grown so fast, but **standards and regulations didn't**. That's why they're super protective against this."

**Quote (Nichelle):**
> "It's so **industry specific**. In a lot of ways, it doesn't exist for additive the same way. We're trying to adapt traditional manufacturing regulations to an additive ecosystem. **It's not an exact one-for-one**."

**Status:** Still working on it, but identified as "critical piece of the puzzle"

**Customer Response:**
> "Those guys are monsters. We don't want this headache. We'd rather buy directly from supply chain, wait for it, pay for it, but not deal with regulations."

---

### 8. Urgency in the Market (Post-OpenAI Developments)

**Quote (Nichelle):**
> "This week with OpenAI, things are shifting **incredibly fast**, faster than I've ever seen. I think as this settles down, everything is gonna get accelerated. What we're doing is **kind of urgent. It's super urgent right now**."

**Strategic Implication:**
- AI advancements accelerating digital manufacturing adoption
- Window of opportunity for early movers
- Canadian companies risk falling further behind
