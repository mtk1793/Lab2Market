## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **EXTRAORDINARY**

Trevor Butler was the organizer and commercial voice of the LR group. His most impactful contribution was an unexpected disclosure: **Atlantic XL in St. John's had just received Lloyd's Register's facility qualification certificate for additive manufacturing — the first in the entire Americas (North and South).** He also explicitly named **FieldNode** as a primary competitor doing exactly what AddManuChain proposes, and provided a crucial clarification — that facility and part qualification are one-time investments, not recurring costs per order. He introduced the Canadian Navy angle (River class destroyers), offered a warm referral to Mark Philpott in Ottawa, and confirmed that a Canadian-first platform has no equivalent presence in the market.

## KEY INSIGHT #1: ATLANTIC XL — FIRST LR-QUALIFIED AM FACILITY IN THE AMERICAS 🎯

This was the single most strategically significant disclosure of the entire meeting:

> *"In the additive manufacturing space, we were successful in securing a contract with a company called Atlantic XL based here in St. John's, and we have delivered to them — just a few days ago, actually last week — their facility qualification certificate for their additive manufacturing facility. And they still have some work to do to print certified parts, but it's a major step in the right direction. And it's the first AM facility we've qualified in North America — well, North and South America actually."*
> — Trevor Butler

### What This Means:

| Fact | Significance |
|------|-------------|
| Atlantic XL (St. John's, NL) = LR-qualified | Only certified AM facility in the entire Americas |
| Facility qualification ≠ part certification | They still need to certify individual parts — first-mover opportunity |
| Trevor + Adam actively working with them | Warm introduction path available |
| Located in St. John's | Heart of offshore O&G market (Hibernia, Hebron, Bay du Nord) |

> **Strategic Pivot:** AddManuChain should pursue Atlantic XL as the anchor production partner immediately. This partnership gives us: certified production capability, LR credibility by association, and geographic alignment with the target market.

## KEY INSIGHT #2: PRE-CERTIFIED PARTS LIBRARY — VALIDATED BY TREVOR

After Adam Saxty walked through the full 7-step certification process, Trevor immediately clarified the most important commercial implication:

> *"A lot of these checks and certification steps do happen in advance. In order for a part end user to purchase a part from a digital inventory, we would assume the printing center is already qualified. They've already gone through that process. They already have the necessary processes and feedstocks qualified — all that's in place. The part, the actual part that they're producing, would have already been design-reviewed and assessed to whatever codes and standards or our rules or whatever that it needs to be. So then the only thing then would be the actual printing and — at the same time printing — a test coupon."*

> *"You don't have to go through all that qualification process every single time. That should be, I would think, a prerequisite to being included in a digital inventory."*
> — Trevor Butler

**This is the commercial validation of the pre-certified parts library model.** The heavy lifting happens once. Subsequent orders = print + test coupon + verify.

## KEY INSIGHT #3: FIELDNODE — PRIMARY COMPETITOR NAMED 🚨

Trevor explicitly named FieldNode midway through the presentation:

> *"Not to be a bit of a downer on this, but I put a link in the chat to the meeting for a company called FieldNode. In my mind, FieldNode already has this. It is an existing AM digital inventory and does all these things, or at least it's supposed to do all of these things that you're talking about here. So I don't know if you're aware of FieldNode or have investigated or how you're proposing is different, but certainly something to evaluate from your end for sure."*

### Our Differentiation (articulated in real-time, Trevor accepted):

| FieldNode | AddManuChain |
|-----------|-------------|
| Software connector only | Certified production platform |
| No certification layer | Handles certification end-to-end |
| European-focused (Equinor/Shell/BP) | Canada-first, sovereign resilience |
| No on-site enablement | Helps operators equip themselves |
| Sells connectivity | Sells **trust** |

Michael's pitch:
> *"The thing that is going to give us the privilege more than a software — to become a platform — is that we are going to somehow do the hard job. We are going to gain the trust from the different certified parts like Lloyd's, and we are going to sell trust to the end user rather than just saying, okay, we are going to connect you guys."*

Trevor's response: *"That's interesting. I would agree with someone like you said there for sure."*

Alireza's validation:
> *"As far as I know, nothing in Canada so far. So this could be good to have this platform made in Canada."*

## KEY INSIGHT #4: CANADIAN NAVY / DEFENSE ANGLE (Trevor's Initiative)

Trevor proactively raised the defense angle unprompted:

> *"Something else that also made me think a little bit about the navy — Canadian national defense — where there is a huge amount of investment coming into the defense sector here in Canada and a lot of it is looking towards domestic spend rather than going and buying stuff internationally. That also makes me think about — especially with a naval vessel — security and things like that. So it might be an angle for you to consider."*

> *"Let's say we have the new River class destroyers. Maybe in some wild future — maybe not so wild, one would hope — those destroyers would have a printer onboard. The Canadian navy would want some level of protection on that — you guys being Canadian-based — that could definitely be something to look towards as a differentiator."*

---

## KEY INSIGHT #5: DALHOUSIE CONNECTION IS AN INSTITUTIONAL ASSET

> *"Dave has a lot of connections with Dalhousie. We've had postdocs come through our team here and actually have done subsequently joined LR on that side. So a lot of good connections there."*
> — Trevor Butler

**Strategic implication:** LR was founded by a Dalhousie professor (1970s). Deep institutional ties = natural partnership anchor for research collaboration and credibility.

## REFERRAL UNLOCKED: MARK PHILPOTT (Ottawa) 🔑

*(Referral organized by Dave Whitehouse — see Interview #46 — but Trevor participated in the decision)*

| Contact | Role | Location | Priority |
|---------|------|----------|----------|
| **Mark Philpott** | Lloyd's Register Ottawa representative | Ottawa, ON | 🔴 HIGH |

Dave confirmed: *"Mark is very well connected"* and agreed to copy him on an email introduction.

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

| Competitor | What Trevor Said | Our Advantage |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **FieldNode** | *"In my mind, FieldNode already has this"* — European, O&G majors | Canada-first; certification layer; trust-selling |
| **Baker Hughes** | Similar concept, European | Canada-first |
| **Atlantic XL** | Just LR-certified | **PARTNER not competitor** |

---

## HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION

| Hypothesis | Status | Trevor's Evidence |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| Pre-certified parts library viable | ✅ CONFIRMED | *"You don't have to go through all that qualification process every single time"* |
| Atlantic XL = key partner | ✅ NEW — ACT NOW | First LR-qualified facility in Americas |
| FieldNode = primary competitor | 🚨 CONFIRMED | Named directly, link shared in meeting chat |
| Canadian market is open | ✅ CONFIRMED | *"Nothing in Canada so far"* — Alireza, accepted by Trevor |
| Defense/Navy = strong market | ✅ CONFIRMED | Proactively raised River class destroyers angle |

> — Trevor Butler, on Atlantic XL ✅ **Use in every pitch**

> *"That's interesting. I would agree with someone like you said there for sure."*
> — Trevor Butler, accepting the differentiation from FieldNode
