## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

⭐⭐⭐⭐ **HIGH-VALUE INTERVIEW** — Scott and Heather confirmed that Aker Solutions has a real, functioning AM workflow in other global regions but has not yet formalized it with Atlantic XL in Newfoundland (too early). Key takeaways: Aker has an internal formal AM screening process led by a dedicated global AM expert (female, to be introduced); clients (operators like ExxonMobil) have settled on FieldNode as the digital inventory platform of choice; the certification process for AM is treated the same as any other manufacturing method (material cert, machining cert, product cert); OEM IP and liability ownership are the two biggest structural barriers; obsolete parts with no OEM support are the "low-hanging fruit" for AM adoption. Both interviewees gave permission for a follow-up meeting and offered to connect Mahmoud with Aker's internal AM expert.

## KEY INSIGHT #1: AKER HAS A REAL AM WORKFLOW — BUT NOT YET IN NL ✅

> **Scott:** *"We have experienced taking an idea from offshore — someone says 'this broke' or 'we need a replacement part' — and we have a process to get a replacement part: designed, printed, certified, and installed offshore effectively."*

> **Scott:** *"We don't actually have a workflow developed with Atlantic XL because it is a little bit nascent in this region. But in other places in the world, we have a workflow based on — ideally — the inventory system."*

### What This Means:
- ✅ The end-to-end AM workflow (identify → design → print → certify → install) **already exists** at Aker globally
- ❌ It has **not been formalized** with Atlantic XL in NL yet — the region is too early-stage
- ✅ Aker knows the pain points and the workflow — they are not starting from scratch
- 🎯 **AddManuChain opportunity:** Be the platform that formalizes the NL workflow. Aker is looking for this to exist.

## KEY INSIGHT #2: FORMAL AM SCREENING PROCESS EXISTS — LED BY AN INTERNAL EXPERT ✅

> **Heather:** *"We have an AM expert, and she's been part of a global initiative within additive manufacturing. They have a specific, structured process through which they put the part through the assessment."*

### The AM Assessment Criteria (Heather's List):

| Criterion | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Certification level** | Does it need to be certified? To what level? |
| **Material type** | What material is required? Is it printable? |
| **Nearby qualified facilities** | Are there certified AM facilities close enough? Can they print that material and provide the relevant certifications? |
| **Safety criticality** | Is it a safety-critical part? |
| **Cost-benefit** | Is there a real commercial case? |
| **Lead time comparison** | Does AM actually cut lead time vs. traditional manufacturing, or is the part readily available? |

> **Heather:** *"Just because it can be printed doesn't mean that it should be."*

### Strategic Implication:
- Aker's AM screening is formal and structured — not ad hoc
- **AddManuChain's AI tool** should mirror this exact checklist — it's already validated by Aker's internal process
- The dedicated AM expert is a **key referral** — Heather offered to connect Mahmoud directly

## KEY INSIGHT #3: CLIENTS HAVE SETTLED ON FIELDNODE — BUT IT'S NOT OUR COMPETITOR ✅

> **Scott:** *"When we do assessments and bring orders, those parts are captured as a digital inventory, so if we need to reprint them, you can just reorder. There are a couple of digital inventory system vendors. Our clients settled on FieldNode because they're the ones who ultimately make the decision."*

### What This Means:
- The **operator** (e.g., ExxonMobil) — not the EPC contractor (Aker) — selects the digital inventory platform
- FieldNode is the current choice in some markets
- **However:** FieldNode is a digital inventory tool. It doesn't connect to certified AM facilities or handle certification workflow. That's the gap AddManuChain fills.
- **Positioning:** Don't compete with FieldNode. Integrate with it or position as the Canada-specific production layer on top of digital inventory.

## KEY INSIGHT #4: CERTIFICATION IS CASE-BY-CASE — SAME PROCESS AS CONVENTIONAL MFG ✅

> **Heather:** *"DNV and Lloyd's treat AM as just another manufacturing procedure. As long as the print facility is qualified for the particular part, the certification process is very much the same — material certificate, machining certificates, final testing certificates, product certificate at the end."*

### DNV vs. Lloyd's Register — Key Difference:

| Body | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **DNV** | Qualifies facilities based on **criticality of parts** (e.g., levels 0–3). Published in their documents. |
| **Lloyd's Register** | Qualifies the **facility's quality management system, machines, and calibrations** regardless of part criticality. Same as qualifying a steel mill for raw materials. |

> **Heather:** *"Lloyd's qualifies the facility for additive manufacturing — it doesn't matter the criticality of the part."*

### Strategic Implication:
- **Atlantic XL (Lloyd's-certified)** is therefore qualified to print parts across all criticality levels — a major competitive advantage
- The certification process is **predictable and documentable** — exactly what AddManuChain's "Certification-as-a-Service" module should automate
- Heather confirmed Aker's internal approach with Lloyd's Register when Mahmoud described the AddManuChain meeting with LR

## KEY INSIGHT #5: OEM IP AND LIABILITY ARE THE TWO STRUCTURAL BARRIERS ⚠️

> **Heather:** *"There's a huge legal IP warranty issue. The OEMs need to be onboard, and it needs to be figured out. The parts they're willing to enter into these agreements for additive manufacturing need to have a business case behind them."*

> **Scott:** *"If someone prints a part, who takes on the liability? Traditionally an OEM would design and manufacture a part, so they'd be responsible for the whole chain. With AM, you're decoupling the design and the manufacturing. Now who owns the liability?"*

- Is it the printer? The OEM? The EPC (Aker)? The operator?

### The Low-Hanging Fruit Solution:

> **Heather:** *"There's a difference with obsolete parts — parts of equipment that OEMs are not supporting anymore. Those are the low-hanging fruit. You sort of skip the OEM step."*

**Translation:** For obsolete parts where the OEM no longer exists or supports the part, you don't need OEM approval. The IP and liability questions are bypassed. This is the beachhead market.

### Strategic Implication:
- **Start with obsolete parts** — OEM barrier doesn't apply
- Build IP/liability framework for OEM-supported parts as Phase 2
- This matches Lee Vessey's Navy insight: non-certified temporary/obsolete parts = immediate opportunity

## KEY INSIGHT #6: IT'S ALWAYS CASE-BY-CASE — PRODUCTION CRITICALITY DRIVES THE DECISION ✅

> **Scott:** *"A screw or a bracket — there could be a situation where we absolutely have to print that bracket from a cost and scheduling perspective. That same bracket might be ordered traditionally if circumstances are slightly different. It all comes down to criticality — safety criticality, but also production criticality. If it has production criticality, there's an extreme cost savings that typically pushes the part over the edge for AM."*

### Real Examples Scott Shared:
- ✅ **Can openers offshore** — printed constantly. Non-critical, high use, easy.
- ✅ **Scaffolding components** — printed regularly. Low safety implication, commercial case exists.
- ⚠️ **Impeller for a pump** — could be printed, but you still have to bring the pump onshore to replace it. What is the real saving?

> **Scott:** *"It's something that's really cool. But does it really save time and cost over traditional manufacturing?"*

### Strategic Implication:
- AddManuChain's AI must include a **production criticality calculator** — not just safety criticality
- The ROI case must answer: "If this part fails, what does the cascade shutdown cost per hour?"
- This aligns directly with Douglas (Equinor) data: 1-2% capex protects 98% of production value

## KEY INSIGHT #7: DIGITAL INVENTORY DEMAND IS REAL — PLATFORM GAP EXISTS IN CANADA ✅

> **Scott:** *"It sounds like that's what we use FieldNode for at the moment. It just needs to be established better in Canada — whether it's FieldNode or some other platform."*

> **Scott:** *"As the ecosystem develops and you see these types of platforms develop — if you establish something like that in Canada, then you're going to end up with a digital inventory that may or may not get used based on the situation."*

### Strategic Implication:
- Scott explicitly called out the **Canada gap** — there is no well-established AM digital inventory platform in Canada
- He did not dismiss AddManuChain — he framed it as the Canadian version of what FieldNode is doing globally
- The question is not "do we need this?" but "will it get used enough to justify the inventory build-up?"

## HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **H1 — Digital thread breaks between design and manufacturing** | ✅ CONFIRMED | Aker has the workflow globally but not formalized in NL yet |
| **H2 — AM part identification is manual/ad hoc** | ❌ PARTIALLY REFUTED | Aker has a structured, formal AM screening process led by a designated expert |
| **H3 — Aker → Atlantic XL workflow has friction** | ✅ CONFIRMED | No formal workflow exists with ATL XL in NL region yet |
| **H4 — Certification is the primary barrier** | 🟡 NUANCED | Certification process is well-understood and predictable — OEM IP/liability is the harder barrier |
| **H5 — AddManuChain fills a gap between existing tools** | ✅ CONFIRMED | FieldNode handles digital inventory; no platform handles Canada-specific AM production + certification |
| **H6 — Aker's global AM program exists** | ✅ CONFIRMED | Internal AM expert running a global initiative; formal structured screening process |
| **Obsolete parts = beachhead market** | ✅ STRONGLY CONFIRMED | Heather: "Those are the low-hanging fruit — you skip the OEM step" |
| **OEM IP/liability = structural barrier** | ✅ STRONGLY CONFIRMED | Scott and Heather both raised this independently |

## ACTION ITEMS

### Immediate:
- [ ] Send thank-you email to Scott and Heather within 24 hours
- [ ] **Request intro to Aker's internal AM Expert** (female, leads global AM initiative) — Heather offered this
- [ ] Add to CRM: Scott = technology evaluator/decision-maker; Heather = certification expert/gateway

### Short-Term:
- [ ] Re-engage in 2–3 months with a refined pitch once OEM conversations have been completed
- [ ] Develop AddManuChain's **production criticality calculator** — validated by Scott's feedback
- [ ] Build "obsolete parts" as explicit Phase 1 use case in the pitch deck (confirmed by 3 separate interviews now: Lee Vessey, Aker, Equinor)

### Medium-Term:
- [ ] Use Aker's AM screening criteria to build AddManuChain's AI part-screening module
- [ ] Explore integration pathway with FieldNode as complementary platform, not competitor
- [ ] Map the Canada gap: no platform fills the Aker → print facility → certification loop domestically

## CONNECTIONS TO OTHER INTERVIEWS

| Interview | Connection |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Lee Vessey (Thales Navy — #13/14)** | Obsolete parts = low-hanging fruit. Same insight independently confirmed by Heather. |
| **Sean Morgan (Atlantic XL — #5)** | Aker works with Atlantic XL; LR certification milestone now links both interviews |
| **Douglas Garcia (Equinor — #44)** | Production criticality economics (1-2% capex, 98% production value) validates Scott's "production criticality pushes the part over the edge" |
| **Dave Whitehouse (Lloyd's Register — #46)** | Heather's deep LR knowledge confirms LR certifies the facility, not the part — aligns with Dave's framing |
| **Tyler Beatty (FieldNode — #33)** | Clients choosing FieldNode confirmed. Explore integration, not competition. |
| **Aaron Plamondon (Irving Shipbuilding — #34)** | Irving ship repair = separate opportunity from Aker's offshore work |

---

## OVERALL RATING: 8/10

**Rationale:** Exceptionally high-quality interview. Confirmed the AM workflow is real and documented at Aker globally; surfaced the Canada gap clearly; gave the most nuanced certification breakdown to date (DNV vs. Lloyd's distinction); independently validated the obsolete parts beachhead and OEM liability barrier. The only gap: no direct referral to ExxonMobil operators yet, and FieldNode remains the tool of choice for clients. But the follow-up permission and referral to Aker's AM expert make this a high-leverage relationship.
