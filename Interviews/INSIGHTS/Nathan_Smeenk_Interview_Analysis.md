# Interview Analysis: Nathan Smeenk
**Interview #35 — VP Operations, Agile Manufacturing Inc.**  
**Date:** February 13, 2026  

---

## Executive Summary

This interview with Nathan Smeenk provided **honest, unfiltered operational reality** from the leader of Canada's largest 3D printing service bureau. Nathan was pragmatic and at times skeptical — he pushed back on digital inventory, questioned what value a "file alone" provides, and pointed out that existing networks (couriers, Spare Parts 3D) already deliver parts within 24 hours. This is **exactly the kind of tough feedback** that shapes a stronger business model.

### Top-Line Verdict
**The gap in Canadian AM isn't technology or certification — it's finance. Canadian companies are timid and underfinanced compared to US peers. Agile is plastic-focused, doesn't do metal, and doesn't know Lloyd's/DNV. Digital inventory "already exists" but is poorly implemented. The opportunity is making it BETTER, not inventing it.**

## 🔑 Key Findings

### 1. "It's a Gap of Finance, Not Technology"
Nathan's answer to "what's the biggest gap?" was unexpected and important:

> *"I don't think there's so much gap of technology. It's a gap of finance. Canadian companies are a little more timid and a little underfinanced relative to our peers to the south."*

**What this means:**
- The technology exists — Canadian companies just aren't investing in it
- This is a **different barrier** than what oil & gas / defence contacts have said (they say certification)
- The difference: **Agile is plastic-focused** — their customers don't face the same certification requirements that marine/defence customers face
- For Agile's world (prototyping, consumer products, light industrial), finance IS the barrier
- For AddManuChain's world (marine, defence, O&G), certification IS the barrier

**💡 Implication:** The barrier depends on the sector. AddManuChain's certification positioning is correct for marine/defence. Agile operates in a different segment where certification barely exists yet.

### 2. Agile = Plastic Only — No Metal In-House

**Critical technical limitation discovered:**

> *"Everything plastic, a little bit metal."*  
> *"We don't do metal in-house."*

| What Agile Does | What Agile Doesn't |
|---|---|
| SLA, SLS, FDM, MJM — all polymer | Metal AM (DMLS, SLM, EBM) |
| Prototyping & end-use plastic parts | Offshore-grade metal components |
| Reverse engineering & CAD services | Shock/vibration/pressure testing |
| Printer sales, service, materials | Lloyd's/DNV certification |

**💡 Implication:** Agile **cannot be a production partner for marine/defence metal parts**. They're a great resource for polymer components (gaskets, fixtures, housings, jigs) but not for the critical metal spare parts that offshore platforms need. AddManuChain needs metal-focused partners like MAMCE, or potentially US-based metal AM bureaus.

---

### 3. Nathan Doesn't Know Lloyd's Register or DNV

When asked about these class societies:

> *"I don't know what those are."*

This is telling. **Agile operates entirely outside the marine/offshore certification ecosystem.** Their clients may deal with Lloyd's and DNV, but Agile as a service bureau has never needed to.

**💡 Implication:** Reinforces that Agile is in a different market segment. But also means **no one in the Canadian AM service bureau space is bridging the gap to marine certification.** That's AddManuChain's opportunity.

---

### 4. Digital Inventory — "Already Exists, But Poorly"

Nathan's pushback on digital inventory was **the most important feedback of the interview:**

> *"The digital inventory thing — that's well underway."*  
> *"It already exists. But what it shares with you is the file, right? And a file doesn't serve you any purpose."*

**Nathan's killer point:**
> *"You need to know how it was set up, what machine it was on, what all the parameters were. So it's kind of a nice little bit of lipstick on a problem. Thanks for the file, but it's more of a problem than a solution."*

**What this means for AddManuChain:**
- ✅ Digital inventory is a **real concept** with existing demand
- ⚠️ But the current implementations are **insufficient** — sharing a CAD file alone is useless
- ✅ AddManuChain must include: **machine parameters, material specs, process settings, QA data** — not just files
- ✅ This is the **differentiation opportunity** — go beyond the file to include the full manufacturing recipe

---

### 5. Existing Competitors Identified

Nathan named two companies doing versions of what AddManuChain proposes:

#### Spare Parts 3D (SP3D)
- What Nathan called "Persecu 3D" — this is **Spare Parts 3D (SP3D)**, headquartered in Paris, France
- SP3D's DigiPART software analyzes inventory for AM-producible parts
- Partners: Ocyan (Brazil), Petroleum Development Oman (PDO)
- Analysis shows **up to 11% of parts** are viable for 3D printing
- Uses **existing couriers** (food/supply deliveries to oil platforms) — not true on-site printing

> *"They use the couriers that deliver food and supplies to the oil platforms. So they're already still moving things great distances, as opposed to on the spot."*

#### Oil & Gas Digital Inventory Consortium (Fieldnode)
- Major companies formed a **digital inventory ecosystem**: ConocoPhillips, Equinor, Shell, TotalEnergies, Vår Energi, ExxonMobil, BP
- **Fieldnode** is the software platform facilitating this
- Equinor aims to **digitalize half its inventory within 10 years**
- European-focused — not yet established in Canada

**Nathan's challenge to AddManuChain:**
> *"These are things that have been in place, poorly, for a long time. How do you make it better?"*

**💡 Response Strategy:** AddManuChain's differentiation must be:
1. **Full manufacturing recipe** (not just files) — parameters, machine specs, material certs
2. **Canadian-focused** — no competitor has established this in Canada
3. **Certified production** — bridge the gap to Lloyd's/DNV/MIL-SPEC that SP3D hasn't solved
4. **AI-driven predictive** component — not just on-demand but anticipatory

### 6. Agile's Growth Strategy — Demand-Driven, Not Build-And-Hope

Agile's business philosophy reveals their approach to market:

> *"We've always believed in offering what is requested of us instead of building it and hoping they come."*

**Current strategic priorities:**
- Maximized manufacturing offering — now optimizing/streamlining
- Adding **democratized 3D printing** (Bambu FDM, Formlabs resin) due to mass adoption
- **Reverse engineering** services
- Higher-level **finishing / post-processing**
- Broader **material offerings**
- **Automation** — especially post-processing

**Goal:** Outposts of Agile across Canada for local production.

> *"My goal is to have outposts of Agile across the country so people can produce their parts locally."*

**💡 Implication:** Agile's distributed vision aligns with AddManuChain's network concept. But they want to do it with **their own outposts**, not through a third-party platform. This makes them a potential **competitor** in the polymer space, not a partner.

### 7. Company Profile — Updated Numbers

| Metric | Details |
|---|---|
| **Age** | 22 years |
| **Facilities** | ~40,000 sq. ft. total (2 locations) |
| **Employees** | ~16* |
| **Location** | Beaverton / Uxbridge, Ontario |
| **Technology** | SLA, SLS, FDM, MJM (all polymer) |
| **Services** | Part production, reverse engineering, CAD, printer sales/service, materials |
| **Approach** | Demand-driven |

*Note: Transcript audio was unclear — exact number may differ from LinkedIn data showing 29 employees.*

---

### 8. AI Opportunity — File Prep Automation

Eric (Nathan's colleague) identified a specific AI application:

> *"With the setup aspects of 3D printing — prepping the files for printing — it requires a lot of human decision-making... If there was a focus on developing a model for that specifically, you might see a massive benefit."*

**💡 Implication:** AI in AM isn't about predictive maintenance (Agile's world) — it's about **automating the build prep workflow.** This could be an AddManuChain feature: AI-assisted file preparation that optimizes orientation, supports, nesting, and build parameters.

---

### 9. COVID Reality Check

Nathan offered a contrarian view on digital inventory's COVID narrative:

> *"During COVID, what would have served the world well was having a physical inventory readily deliverable."*

> *"People have to be careful of the value of digital inventory over real inventory."*

**💡 Implication:** Don't oversell the COVID supply chain disruption angle. Physical inventory has real value — digital inventory is a **complement**, not a replacement. AddManuChain's messaging should be "reduce your physical inventory by 20-30%" — not "eliminate physical inventory."

## Connections to Previous Interviews

| Interview | Connection | Comparison |
|---|---|---|
| **Aaron Plamondon** | Both say AM adoption is blocked — but for different reasons | Aaron: governance/trust. Nathan: finance. Different segments, different barriers. |
| **Shawn Sooley** | Shawn's "3D printer as copier" — Nathan IS that copier | Agile is the service bureau model Shawn envisions, but plastic only |
| **Tyler Beatty** | Tyler needs metal parts for offshore — Agile can't print them | ❌ Technical mismatch — Agile is wrong partner for Tyler's use cases |
| **Mike Paulin** | Mike needs Arctic-rated metal components — Agile can't make them | ❌ Same gap — polymer bureau can't serve marine/defence needs |
| **Aaron (MAMCE)** | MAMCE does metals research — Agile does production plastic | 🔗 Complementary capabilities if connected correctly |

## Hypothesis Validation Scorecard

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Certification is the #1 barrier | ⚠️ **SECTOR-DEPENDENT** | Nathan says finance, not certification — but he's in plastics |
| AM service bureaus want to join a platform network | ❌ **NOT VALIDATED** | Agile wants their own outposts, skeptical of "file sharing" platforms |
| Digital inventory is innovative | ⚠️ **PARTIALLY INVALIDATED** | "Already exists" — SP3D, Fieldnode, O&G consortium already doing this |
| On-demand printing beats physical inventory | ⚠️ **CHALLENGED** | "People have to be careful of the value of digital inventory over real inventory" |
| AI can optimize AM workflows | ✅ **VALIDATED** | Eric: "AI for file prep/setup would be a massive benefit" |
| Canadian AM bureau can serve marine/defence | ❌ **NOT FOR METALS** | Agile is plastic only, doesn't know Lloyd's/DNV |

---

## Strategic Takeaway

Nathan's interview is the **most important reality check** so far. He exposed that:

1. **The concept isn't new** — existing players (SP3D, Fieldnode) are already doing digital inventory
2. **A file alone is useless** — you need full manufacturing recipe data
3. **Physical inventory has real value** — don't oversell digital replacement
4. **Agile can't be a metal AM partner** — wrong technology for marine/defence
5. **The opportunity is in execution** — "How do you make it better?" is the question

**AddManuChain's differentiation must be:**
- 🔐 **Full manufacturing recipe** (not just files)
- 🇨🇦 **Canada-first** (no competitor has established here)
- 📋 **Certified production** (bridge to Lloyd's/DNV/MIL-SPEC)
- 🤖 **AI-enhanced** (build prep, predictive ordering)
- 🏭 **Metal-capable partners** (MAMCE, defence AM facilities)
