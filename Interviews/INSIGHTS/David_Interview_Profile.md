## Critical Findings from Interview

### Finding #1: AM Currently Focused on Education/Testing, Not Production 🔴

**Observation:**
> "Right now the focus is mostly on the educational and testing part rather than using it actually in the different industries."

**Industry Status:**
- AM adoption still in early stages for large-scale industrial production
- Primary use cases: prototyping, testing, research
- Production applications limited to specific niches

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Platform must address the "trust gap" preventing production adoption
- Early adopters will be companies already testing AM (not pure newcomers)
- Education + certification will be critical value proposition

---

### Finding #2: Coating Side is Critical for Industries 🔴

**Observation:**
> "Coating is quite important for different industries related to that."

**Why Coatings Matter:**
- Corrosion protection in harsh environments (offshore, oil sands)
- Wear resistance for high-friction applications
- Heat resistance for power generation components
- Surface finish for regulatory compliance

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Platform must account for post-processing (coatings) in digital inventory
- Certification must include coating specifications
- Supply chain must connect to coating service providers

---

### Finding #3: Trust Gap Varies by Stakeholder 🔴

**Observation:**
> "The current trust gap here is different from stakeholder to another but the main issue is mostly at the supply chain part that could be hard to have communication with them for different industrial parts."

**Trust Gap Breakdown:**
- **OEMs:** Trust in IP protection, quality control
- **Operators:** Trust in part reliability, certification
- **Supply Chain:** Communication challenges, specification clarity, lead time predictability

**Biggest Challenge:** Supply chain communication and coordination

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Platform must solve communication/coordination problem FIRST
- Different messaging for different stakeholder types
- Focus early efforts on supply chain pain points

---

### Finding #4: Digital Inventory for Low-Risk Parts Only (Currently) 🔴

**Observation:**
> "Another part that he mentioned was about the usage of AM and digital inventory for low risk parts rather than high risk ones."

**Current Industry Approach:**
- Start with non-critical, low-risk parts to build confidence
- High-risk parts (safety-critical, pressure-bearing) require extensive validation
- Gradual expansion as trust builds

**Examples of Low-Risk Parts:**
- Non-structural brackets
- Housings and enclosures
- Tooling and fixtures
- Non-pressure-bearing ducts

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- MVP should target low-risk part categories FIRST
- Build evidence base before approaching high-risk applications
- Clear categorization system (risk levels) needed in platform

---

### Finding #5: Reverse Engineering Companies Already Exist 🟢

**Observation:**
> "For the reverse engineering part he mentioned that there are some companies that regularly go on site for the equipment that are not built anymore to scan them and make blueprints by using the reverse engineering."

**Current Process:**
- Companies offer on-site scanning services
- Create CAD files from physical parts (obsolete parts)
- Manual, specialized service (not scalable)

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Reverse engineering is validated pain point ✅
- Opportunity to integrate with these service providers
- Platform can make scans + blueprints SEARCHABLE in digital inventory
- Potential partnership opportunity (don't compete, integrate)

---

### Finding #6: Power Generation is Major AM Use Case 🟢

**Observation:**
> "Another factor which was surprising well was about the usage of AM in power plants work or sectors related to the power which is so useful."

**Power Generation AM Applications:**
- Gas turbine components (blades, vanes, burners)
- Heat exchangers
- Cooling systems
- Rapid repair of critical components
- On-demand spare parts (reduce downtime)

**Why Power Sector is Adopting AM:**
- High downtime costs ($100K+ per day)
- Long lead times for traditional parts (months)
- Complex geometries benefit from AM (cooling channels)
- Repair applications validated (Siemens, GE Vernova)

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Power generation should be targeted segment (alongside oil & gas)
- Strong willingness to pay (downtime is expensive)
- Existing AM adoption validates technology readiness

---

### Finding #7: Automated Repair Approaches Desired 🟢

**Observation:**
> "And also they focused over the automated repair and approaches that would be beneficial for them."

**Automated Repair Context:**
- Predictive maintenance + automated repair workflows
- Integration with IoT sensors (equipment health monitoring)
- Automated ordering when failure predicted
- Robotic/AM-based repair systems

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Platform could integrate with predictive maintenance systems
- Trigger digital inventory orders automatically
- API integration opportunity with equipment monitoring platforms

---

### Finding #8: Trust Between Industries and AM Producers Not Yet Established ⚠️

**Observation:**
> "Related to using digital inventory and physical parts he mentioned that they need to build trust between the industries and AM producers that is why at the current moment they still think is early for AM to be useful for the bigger markets."

**Trust Barriers:**
- Quality consistency concerns
- Certification/qualification gaps
- Lack of long-term reliability data
- IP protection fears
- Supply chain transparency issues

**Timeline:**
- Still "early" for bigger markets
- Trust-building will take time
- Gradual adoption, not sudden shift

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Platform must CERTIFY and VERIFY quality
- Transparency features critical (who printed, when, materials used, testing data)
- Focus on early adopter markets FIRST (not "bigger markets" yet)
- Build case studies and evidence base over time

---

### Finding #9: Energy Sector Outsourcing Digital Inventory (Not Building In-House) 🔴

**Observation:**
> "On the other hand in the energy sector they are moving through to the digital inventory not by themselves but by making contracts with other companies to do it for them or university."

**Outsourcing Model:**
- Energy companies NOT building internal AM capabilities
- Contracting with:
  - Specialized AM service providers
  - Universities and research labs (InnoTech, etc.)
  - Technology platforms (Fieldnode, etc.)

**Why Outsourcing:**
- Core competency focus (energy production, not manufacturing)
- Avoid capital investment in AM equipment
- Access expertise without hiring
- Flexibility to scale up/down

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- This VALIDATES the SaaS platform model ✅
- Energy companies are buyers (customers), not competitors
- Platform competes with service providers, not with end users
- Partnership opportunity with universities/research labs

---

### Finding #10: Canada Lagging in On-Site 3D Printing Facilities ⚠️

**Observation:**
> "In Canada they are not that kind of eager to install 3d printing facilities on site. On another hand in the US and other countries like Singapore they are working on that part now."

**Geographic Differences:**
- **USA:** Installing on-site AM facilities (offshore platforms, remote sites)
- **Singapore:** Active investment in on-site AM
- **Canada:** More conservative, slower adoption

**Why Canada is Slower:**
- Risk-averse culture in energy sector
- Regulatory environment more stringent
- Colder climate challenges for on-site equipment
- Smaller market size (compared to US)

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **Near-term:** Focus on Canada's "network model" (regional hubs, not on-site)
- **Long-term:** Prepare for on-site model as it expands from US/Singapore
- Highlight Canadian success stories to overcome conservatism
- Partner with international players already doing on-site
