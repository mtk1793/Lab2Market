# Interview #47 — Analysis
## Interviewee: Ali (Supply Chain Logistics & Adoption Researcher)
**Date:** February 2026  
**Interviewer:** Mahmoud Kiasari  
**Role:** Supply Chain Logistics Researcher — studies technology adoption politics in industrial supply chains  
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Strong academic validation + game theory framing + pending leads

---

## 1. RAW NOTES SUMMARY

Ali studies the **politics of supply chain** — specifically, how clients and manufacturers decide to adopt new technologies, and what the optimal balance of cost vs. time is across different industries (e.g., transportation, offshore, manufacturing). His research is directly relevant to AddManuChain's go-to-market challenge.

## 2. KEY INSIGHTS

### 2.1 — Technology Adoption Is Political, Not Technical

> *"Most liked to work traditional — they don't like modern ways of working."*

**What this means for AddManuChain:**  
The barrier to adopting our platform is **not** whether AM works or whether certification exists. The barrier is **organizational inertia and political risk**. Decision-makers won't change unless they're forced to (by a mandate) or convinced by someone they already trust.

**Adoption triggers Ali identified:**
1. **Endorsement from a very large company or trusted brand** — people follow industry leaders
2. **Top-down mandate ("dictatorship")** — regulatory body, government, or corporate policy forces adoption
3. **Internal R&D legitimacy** — companies with their own R&D are more receptive (they "get" innovation)

**Strategic implication:**  
→ Don't sell to operators directly first. Get **one major O&G company** (e.g., Equinor) or one **regulatory anchor** (e.g., Lloyd's Register, DND) to mandate or endorse the platform. Everyone else follows.  
→ This perfectly aligns with Keith Healey's "engage the regulator early" advice and Jason Power's "integrator pivot."

### 2.2 — The ROI Threshold: 10–15% Minimum

> *"They are looking for at least 10% to 15% of ROI."*

**This is a hard quantitative gate.** Before any company will even seriously evaluate AddManuChain, they need to see a clear financial model showing ≥10–15% ROI. This validates:
- Kwadwo Ampofo (Deloitte, Interview #25): *"More spare parts = increased working capital with NO benefit. Become a CFO problem."*
- OMV Austria (Interviews #15, #18): *"15% ROI threshold for any technology investment."*

**What our ROI story must show:**
| Driver | Quantified Value |
|--------|-----------------|
| Downtime reduction | $50K–$100K/day avoided (Adam Mars, Interview #48) |
| Working capital freed | 30% of $30–50M inventory = $9–15M released (Jason Power) |
| Inventory holding cost saved | 20–25%/year on stored value (Kwadwo) |
| CO2/logistics savings | Supporting metric — not primary (see below) |

**Model to build:** If AM digital inventory converts even 5% of £30M vessel inventory → $1.5M freed × 25% holding cost = **$375K/year savings** per vessel, before any downtime events.

### 2.3 — Deployment Cost Is the Hidden Objection

> *"There are costs if you also put deployment — getting even 5% of physical inventory to digital."*

This is a **critical sales objection** Ali surfaced: companies see the ROI of digital inventory in the long run but are paralyzed by **upfront deployment costs**:
- Installing machines / printers
- Training people
- Regulatory engagement (certification for each part)
- IT integration (ERP, inventory systems)

**Counter-strategy:**
- Pilot model removes this barrier: we do the digitization work for them in the pilot
- "Certify once" reuse model eliminates ongoing re-certification cost
- Start with 5–20 parts, not the whole inventory (Mark Kirby's "it's a 5% solution" validated)

### 2.4 — Environmental / Green Company Narrative as a Motivator

> *"Companies are okay with being considered green companies to reduce CO2. This idea could reduce transportation CO2 emissions."*

**Note:** Ali clarified that environmental factors in manufacturing typically sit in the **production section**, not the supply chain logistics section. However, for spare parts specifically, the CO2 reduction angle lives in the **logistics section** (less global shipping = lower emissions).

**When to use this argument:**
- ESG-reporting companies (major O&G operators under investor pressure)
- Government procurement (carbon commitments)
- European operators (stricter ESG requirements — aligned with Equinor Norway precedent)

**When NOT to lead with it:**
- Canadian Navy / Defense (sovereign capability is the argument)
- Arctic utilities under emergency pressure (operational survival, not ESG)

### 2.5 — Game Theory Application to Our Market

Ali raised **game theory** as a lens for the supply chain adoption problem. Here's what this means for AddManuChain:

#### The Prisoner's Dilemma of AM Adoption

Every operator knows: *"If I adopt AM and my competitors don't, I absorb the deployment cost and risk alone."*  
Every operator also knows: *"If everyone adopts AM, I'll be at a disadvantage if I'm the last to join."*

This creates a **classic coordination problem**:
- No one wants to go first
- But everyone knows the technology is coming
- The first-mover advantage is real but the first-mover cost is high

**Game theory strategies for AddManuChain:**

| Strategy | How to Apply |
|---------|-------------|
| **Nash Equilibrium (mutual coordination)** | Create a **consortium** — multiple operators share pilot cost and risk. Nobody has first-mover disadvantage. Keith Healey (#27) validated this model. |
| **Dominant strategy induction** | Show that *regardless of what competitors do*, adopting the platform dominates not adopting it (ROI > cost in all scenarios). |
| **Focal point / Schelling point** | Use a major industry event (Hannover Messe, ONS Norway, Offshore Technology Conference) to make AddManuChain the visible "meeting point" the industry coordinates around. |
| **Signaling game** | LR/DNV certification is a credibility signal. Companies trust it because it's costly and verifiable — it proves you're serious, not a startup. |
| **Repeated game dynamics** | Per-print royalty model (not one-time licensing) creates a long-term recurring game where OEMs are incentivized to keep improving blueprints → better platform → more prints → more royalties. |

**Key insight:** Ali's game theory angle explains **WHY** the "big name endorsement" is so powerful — it breaks the coordination problem. If Equinor endorses AddManuChain → it becomes the dominant strategy for every other offshore operator to follow.

## 3. STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS FOR ADDMANUCHAIN

| Insight | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Adoption is political — trust a big name | Target Equinor Bay du Nord as anchor. Their endorsement is worth more than 100 sales calls. |
| ROI gate is 10–15% minimum | Build and publish a clear 1-page ROI calculator on the website |
| Deployment cost is the hidden objection | Structure pilot so we absorb the deployment work (not the client) |
| Green narrative is valid but secondary | Use in ESG-reporting contexts and European operators; not primary |
| Game theory → consortium model | Propose a multi-operator pilot consortium (3 operators share cost/risk) |
| Big name or mandate unlocks the market | Approach Lloyd's Register or DND about co-endorsement or mandating platform use |

## 4. PENDING ACTIONS

- [ ] **Follow up with Ali for the leads** he promised — contact TBD
- [ ] **Ask Ali to elaborate on specific game theory models** applicable to our market (Stackelberg? Cournot? Multi-sided platform competition?)
- [ ] Ask Ali: "Which industries in his research adopted faster and why?" → extract transferable lessons for offshore AM adoption
- [ ] Consider inviting Ali to review the ROI model for academic validation

## 5. ALIGNMENT WITH PREVIOUS INTERVIEWS

| This Interview | Confirms |
|---------------|---------|
| *"They need a very big name to trust"* | Jason Power: target integrators (HMH, Baker Hughes), not operators directly |
| *"10–15% ROI minimum"* | OMV Austria, Adam Chubbs: show hard financial case |
| *"Deployment cost is a barrier"* | Mark Kirby: "It's a 5% solution" — don't oversell scope |
| *"Researchers are not valid to them"* | Kwadwo: sell to CFOs not engineers; academic validation alone doesn't close deals |
| *"Green narrative is a secondary motivator"* | ALMA-TECH Pitch Deck Slide 7: CO2 footprint listed as a benefit, not the core value prop |
