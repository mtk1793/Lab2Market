**Critical Quotes:**
> "Hundreds of thousands of parts… they don't know what is." — Frank DeFalco (#8)

> "It already exists. But what it shares with you is the file, right? And a file doesn't serve you any purpose. You need to know how it was set up, what machine it was on, what all the parameters were." — Nathan Smeenk (#35)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Digital inventory is REAL validated need
- But current implementations insufficient (Nathan Smeenk)
- Must include: **machine parameters, material specs, process settings, QA data** — NOT just CAD files
- Full "manufacturing recipe" is differentiator

### 6 Hypotheses Contradicted by Evidence

### Mining is Good Early Target

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Hypothesis Statement** | Mining sector is strong beachhead due to remote operations and high downtime costs |
| **BMC Block** | Customer Segments |
| **Status** | ❌ REJECTED |

**Contradicting Evidence:**
- #17 (Jean-Michel Fortin, Agnico Eagle Mines) - **"Volume mismatch"** — mining orders parts in bulk (hundreds of units), AM makes 1-50 units only
- #17 - **12-month ordering cycles** — mining plans far enough ahead that AM speed advantage doesn't matter
- #17 - **Multi-stakeholder consensus required** — slows decision-making
- #20 (Assembly Studio) - Confirmed volume mismatch for mining

**Critical Quotes:**
> "Volume mismatch, 12-month ordering cycles" — Jean-Michel Fortin (#17)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Remove mining from beachhead target list
- AI inventory optimization ONLY (no AM) for mining
- Focus on O&G/Marine/Defense where volume matches AM

---

### Target Big O&G Operators Directly

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Hypothesis Statement** | Target end-user operators (Shell, ExxonMobil, etc.) directly as primary customers |
| **BMC Block** | Customer Segments |
| **Status** | ❌ REJECTED |

**Contradicting Evidence:**
- #4 (Jason Power) - **"The best target would be integrators"** — end users don't decide manufacturing methods
- #4 - Operators are reactive on technology: "The company should go to them and should sell them capabilities"
- #20 (Assembly Studio) - *"We have deep pockets. We don't care."* — big companies feel no pain
- #23 (Jim Granger) - OEMs/integrators are decision-makers, not operators

**Critical Quotes:**
> "The idea of using AM goes back to whether individual supplier vendors would like to use that or not. In the concept of big industries like oil and gas, it's not that meaningful [to target operators]." — Jason Power (#4)

> "The best target would be integrators." — Jason Power (#4)

**Strategic Implications:**
- **PIVOT:** Target integrators/OEMs (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes, Weatherford)
- One integrator partnership = access to entire operator customer base
- Don't pitch directly to Shell/ExxonMobil
- Exception: Equinor (greenfield + AM champion)

- #34 (Aaron Plamondon) - **"Data isn't good enough for us to plug it in"**

**Critical Quotes:**
> "AI will just muddy the waters… solve the fundamentals first." — Kwadwo Ampofo (#25)

> "I wouldn't try to sell AI. Sell the solution." — Shawn Sooley (#32)

**Strategic Implications:**
- DON'T lead pitch with "AI-powered"
- AI is enhancement layer, not primary value prop
- Lead with: Working capital liberation, certification-as-a-service, fast sourcing
- AI features: Inventory optimization (yes), QA (no)
