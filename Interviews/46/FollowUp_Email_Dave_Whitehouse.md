# Follow-up Email: Dave Whitehouse (Lloyd's Register)

**Subject:** Following Up: AddManuChain, Submarine Certification, and Mark Philpott Intro

**Body:**

Hi Dave,

Thank you again for joining the group meeting last week despite the snowstorm. Your perspective from the naval and defense side of Lloyd's Register was incredibly insightful—arguably the most strategically powerful use cases we've uncovered in our Lab2Market customer discovery so far.

I’m reaching out because I would love to continue our conversation, specifically regarding the submarine maintenance scenario you described. The challenge of keeping Canada’s 4 custom Victoria-class submarines operational—requiring fully custom "as-built" parts for 30-year-old vessels with only 5-10 years of life remaining—perfectly illustrates the exact problem AddManuChain is designed to solve. Digitizing those as-built records to enable pre-certified, on-demand printing could drastically improve the current 30-50% fleet availability gap you mentioned. 

I’m also very interested in your insight about targeting AOR/JSS support vessels for containerized AM modules, rather than combat ships, due to space and vibration constraints. 

As we refine our proposals for DND (particularly emphasizing the Arctic sovereignty and supply chain independence angles you suggested), your continued guidance would be invaluable. 

Also, if the offer still stands, I would be extremely grateful for an email introduction to Mark Philpott in Ottawa. Engaging with him about defense procurement, maintenance, and classification would be an excellent next step. Furthermore, I am looking into the Canadian Naval Maintenance Symposium in Quebec that you brought up!

Would you be open to a brief follow-up call sometime next week to dive slightly deeper into the submarine and AOR use cases? 

Best regards,

Mahmoud (Michael) Kiasari
