## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **EXTRAORDINARY — Naval & Defense Authority**

Dave Whitehouse provided the most strategically powerful Navy use case in the entire customer discovery process. His **submarine certification case study** (custom ships, as-built parts, 10-year lifespan absurdity) crystallized the Navy pitch in a way no prior interview had. He confirmed Canadian Navy ship availability is at 30–50% with a target of 70–80% — an enormous gap that AM could directly address. He identified **AOR/JSS vessels** (Auxiliary Oiler Replenishment / Joint Support Ships) as the correct platform for ship-based AM (not combat vessels). He raised **IP protection** as the first concern before AddManuChain even got to that slide. He unlocked the **Mark Philpott referral** (LR Ottawa, naval connections) and disclosed the **Canadian Naval Maintenance Symposium** in Quebec as a must-attend event. He also confirmed the **Arctic/DND angle** as the strongest government funding lever in Canada.

## KEY INSIGHT #1: THE SUBMARINE CASE STUDY — USE THIS IN EVERY NAVY PITCH 🚢

Dave's most powerful contribution was an unprompted, detailed story about Canadian submarine maintenance:

> *"The story that came up — and I think it's relevant to this — was a meeting with some of the people who were kind of maintenance-focused on the submarines. They were talking about: for the current submarines, they're all custom, all 4 of them, they're all built slightly differently. And their certification process requires, if you replace a part, that it has to be installed as-built. So it's very frustrating because there are no more parts in inventory. So they're going down that route of having to have things custom manufactured. But they have to be done in a way that matches what the original part was."*

> *"Here you have vessels that are sailing — days, if hopefully months a year — which only have a lifespan of about 5 years left, maybe 10 years left. We're operating ships that are already 20-30 years old. Why are you putting an as-built part in when you may only need it for 10 years? Sorry, that's my rant about this. But the philosophy around using additive manufactured parts in a maintenance program hasn't really been thought through."*
> — Dave Whitehouse

### The Situation:
- Canada's 4 Victoria-class submarines are all custom-built, each slightly different
- "As-built" certification: replacement parts must exactly replicate the original install condition
- No original parts remain in inventory → everything must be custom-manufactured
- Ships are 20–30 years old with only 5–10 years of service life remaining
- Yet: full as-built certification is required for every replacement part

### AddManuChain's Answer:
- AM + digital inventory + smart certification = custom part produced to spec, on-demand
- No need for "as-built" process when AM can replicate the as-built geometry precisely
- Pre-certified parts library + LR validation = faster, cheaper, more rational than current approach

> **Pitch line:** *"30-year-old ships with 10 years of life left, requiring full as-built custom manufacturing for every replacement part. We digitize the as-built record and print on demand."*

## KEY INSIGHT #2: CANADIAN NAVY AVAILABILITY — THE CORE METRIC

> *"When the navy — the big thing — and it's for this yesterday — they're going, it's all about availability of ships. And if you can increase the availability of ships, you'll get a good listen. Because I think right now the thing is 30-50%, and then they want to increase to like 70 or 80%, which is going to require a lot of investment. And modernizing their processes — additive manufacturing could be part of that."*
> — Dave Whitehouse

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Canadian Navy ship availability | **30–50%** |
| Navy target availability | **70–80%** |
| Gap | **20–50 percentage points** |
| AM's role | Faster parts → faster return to service → higher availability |

**Pitch line:** *"Canadian Navy ships are available 30–50% of the time. Their target is 70–80%. Spare parts delay is a primary driver. We solve spare parts delay."*

---

## KEY INSIGHT #3: AOR/JSS VESSELS — THE RIGHT NAVAL ARCHITECTURE FOR SHIP-BASED AM 🚢

Dave clarified why on-vessel AM on combat ships is premature — and identified the correct naval platform:

> *"On a platform, they would have to maybe be shock-isolated because of vibrations from all the equipment and changes in the weather. On a ship, the ships have ship motions."*

> *"I would think rather than having them on actually on a combat vessel, it's more likely that you put them on an AOR [Auxiliary Oiler Replenishment] or like the Asterisk or the JSS — a vessel that's meant to service the fleet. They have more room, they're already designed to have containerized modules."*

| Vessel Type | AM Feasibility | Reason |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Combat ships (frigates, destroyers) | ❌ Difficult | Vibration, motion, limited space, tactical operations |
| AOR / JSS (support/replenishment ships) | ✅ High | Designed for containerized modules, larger, stationary-ish |
| Shore-based naval facilities (Halifax, Esquimalt) | ✅ Best short-term | Certified facility, controlled environment |

> **Go-to-market implication:** Short-term pitch = shore-based certified facilities (Halifax, Esquimalt) serving the Navy. Medium-term = containerized AM module on AOR/JSS vessels using LR containerized AM standards.

---

## KEY INSIGHT #4: ARCTIC / DND — THE STRONGEST GOVERNMENT FUNDING ANGLE

> *"The Arctic aspect — I think that's potentially huge. Because as you said, the supply chains are so long. It may not be in every ship that goes up, but you may have to be able to bring in something based in Iqaluit or one of the due bases, or even bring something in specifically if there are parts that need to be made locally or as part of a deployment."*

> *"The Arctic aspect always looks really good if you have that in your proposal on something to DND."*
> — Dave Whitehouse

### Why Arctic Works for DND Proposals:
1. **Supply chains are extreme** — parts for Arctic operations can take weeks or months
2. **Deployment scenarios** — military operations in Arctic need self-sufficient parts capability
3. **DND funding** — Arctic sovereignty is a political and defense priority in Canada
4. **Pre-positioned AM capability** — Iqaluit or forward bases as certified print nodes

> **Action:** Include Arctic sovereignty + AM supply chain independence in every DND/PSPC proposal.

## KEY INSIGHT #5: IP PROTECTION — DAVE'S FIRST CONCERN (Even Before the Slide)

Dave raised IP before AddManuChain even reached that section of the presentation:

> *"I just — when you first showed your slide and you're talking about IP — I'm not an IP expert, but it kind of dominates a lot of my time. There's the IP of things that aren't readily available — the custom something that broke, the company no longer exists, and finding or building an equivalent part. But just providing assurance to the manufacturer, the OEM, that the IP is being protected throughout that whole process, and that you're not simply going to hand it up to their competitors. I think that's a really key aspect. That would have to be established before talking or trying to bring in the OEM."*

### Two Angles Dave Identified:
1. **Active IP (OEM exists):** Must guarantee OEM IP is not shared with competitors → cybersecurity, encryption, permission-based CAD release
2. **Obsolete IP (OEM no longer exists):** Reverse engineering (Physna 3D mentioned) → scan-to-blueprint for discontinued parts

### Michael's Response (Validated by Dave):
- **Solution 1:** Cybersecurity + full encryption; CAD released only with OEM permission and payment
- **Solution 2:** Black-box hardware (Raspberry Pi equivalent) at the certified facility — OEM stores their IP in a sealed, secure device

Dave's response: *"That is a really important [point]. Thank you for bringing it back."*

## KEY INSIGHT #6: DEFENSE CONNECTIVITY — HOW TO OVERRIDE IP RESISTANCE

> *"Something else that made me think... there is a huge amount of investment coming into the defense sector here in Canada and a lot of it is looking towards domestic spend rather than going and buying stuff internationally. That also makes me think about — especially with a naval vessel — security and things like that."*

> *"Let's say we have the new River class destroyers. Maybe in some wild future — maybe not so wild, one would hope — those destroyers would have a printer onboard. The Canadian navy would want some level of protection on that — you guys being Canadian-based — that could definitely be something to look towards as a differentiator."*

**Strategic implication:** If DND mandates Canadian-platform usage in naval procurement (similar to how US DoD flows down connectivity requirements), OEM IP resistance is overridden by the procurement contract. Target DND/PSPC as the mandate-setter, not the OEMs directly.

## REFERRAL UNLOCKED: MARK PHILPOTT (Ottawa) 🔑

> *"I think the best person I'd probably be good to talk to is Mark Philpott — our guy in Ottawa. He would probably be able to refer you to specific people. He's very well connected and aware of how maintenance and classification and all this works together."*
> — Dave Whitehouse

> *"I'll put it in the chat here... I'll copy him in. Mark is very well connected."*

| Contact | Organization | Role | Location | Priority |
|---------|-------------|------|----------|----------|
| **Mark Philpott** | Lloyd's Register | Ottawa representative, naval/defense | Ottawa, ON | 🔴 URGENT |

**Action:** Email Dave Whitehouse within 48 hours to confirm Mark Philpott intro was sent.

---

## REFERRAL #2: Canadian NAVAL MAINTENANCE SYMPOSIUM (Quebec)

> *"First of all, just before I forget, there's a meeting in Quebec — a small conference called the Naval Canadian Maintenance Symposium. It's put on by Naval Quebec, and it started off as being a DAVIE-focused initiative, but it has attracted the other major shipbuilders — Irving. It's probably useful for you to attend if you can, just because it seemed like it was gaining importance, and we're going to be there."*
> — Dave Whitehouse

| Event | Organizer | Attendees | LR Attending? | Priority |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Canadian Naval Maintenance Symposium | Naval Quebec | DAVIE, Irving Shipbuilding, Navy | **Yes — Dave attending** | 🔴 HIGH |

**Action:** Research dates, registration. Attend if Schedule allows — Dave will be there.

---

## DALHOUSIE CONNECTION

> *"I should just point out that our late founder was a Dalhousie Prof. of the 1970s — started the company. So it's got a long history of connections with Dalhousie and the former Technical University of Nova Scotia."*

**Strategic implication:** LR was founded by a Dalhousie professor. Institutional relationship runs deeper than a vendor–client dynamic. Use this in partnership proposals, grant applications, and DND proposals.
