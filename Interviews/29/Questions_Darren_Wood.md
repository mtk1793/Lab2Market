**Date:** TBD  
**Interviewee:** Darren Wood, Area Manager (Atlantic Canada)  
**Company:** Proax Technologies Ltd.  
**Focus:** Industrial Automation Distribution & Spare Parts Logistics

---

## Interview Context & Strategy

### Why Darren Wood?
Darren manages industrial automation distribution across Atlantic Canada, giving him unique insights into:
- **Distributor economics**: Inventory carrying costs, slow-moving parts, and margin pressures
- **Customer pain points**: Lead times, obsolete parts, and emergency procurement
- **Market access**: Direct relationships with O&G, mining, and manufacturing customers
- **Partnership potential**: Could distributors be part of the AddManuChain network?

### Strategic Alignment with Week 6 Insights
- ✅ **Kwadwo's "Business Network" model**: Distributors could orchestrate AM delivery
- ✅ **Keith's consortium approach**: Proax could be a distribution partner
- ✅ **Andrew's <50-unit threshold**: Distributors struggle with low-volume parts too

### Interview Approach
- **Frame as collaboration**: "How can digital inventory complement traditional distribution?"
- **Focus on pain points**: "What are the hardest parts to source?"
- **Quantify economics**: Get specific data on lead times, margins, and emergency costs

## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: Inventory Pain Points & Obsolete Parts 🎯
**"In your experience managing industrial automation distribution across Atlantic Canada, what percentage of customer requests involve parts that are either obsolete, have long lead times (>4 weeks), or require minimum order quantities that don't make sense for the customer?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates our core hypothesis**: That slow-moving/obsolete parts are a real problem
- **Quantifies the opportunity**: If 20% of requests are problematic, that's our TAM
- **Tests the <50-unit threshold**: Andrew said AM only works for small quantities

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Specific percentages**: "About 15-20% of requests are for hard-to-source parts"
- ✅ **Customer frustration**: "Customers get really upset when we can't deliver quickly"
- ✅ **Economic impact**: "We lose margin on small orders because of MOQs"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "This isn't really a problem for us" (invalidates hypothesis)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which industries have the worst obsolescence issues? O&G? Mining? Manufacturing?"
- "Do you track the cost of lost sales due to unavailable parts?"
- "What's the typical MOQ from your suppliers, and how does that affect small orders?"

### Q2: Lead Time Economics & Emergency Procurement 💰
**"When a customer has an emergency breakdown and needs a part immediately, what's your current process? How do lead times and costs compare between standard procurement (3-4 weeks) versus emergency delivery (24-48 hours)?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Quantifies willingness to pay**: Emergency = higher margins = our pricing opportunity
- **Validates working capital hypothesis**: Fast delivery reduces downtime costs
- **Tests helicopter sharing insight**: Do customers coordinate parts sharing in emergencies?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Premium pricing**: "Emergency orders can be 2-3x the normal price"
- ✅ **Downtime costs**: "Customers will pay anything to avoid $50K/day in lost production"
- ✅ **Current workarounds**: "They sometimes borrow parts from other sites"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Customers are fine waiting 4 weeks" (no urgency = no market)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's the most you've seen a customer pay for emergency delivery?"
- "Do you have relationships with helicopter services for offshore deliveries?"
- "How often do customers ask if you can source parts from competitors?"

### Q3: Distribution Margins & Slow-Moving Inventory 📊
**"For slow-moving or low-volume parts, how do your margins compare to high-turnover items? And what percentage of your inventory is tied up in parts that move less than once per year?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates distributor pain**: If margins are low and capital is tied up, there's a business case
- **Tests working capital hypothesis**: Keith said "in the millions" for Equinor
- **Explores partnership model**: If distributors are struggling, they might welcome AM

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Margin compression**: "Slow-moving parts have 10-15% margins vs. 30% for fast movers"
- ✅ **Inventory carrying costs**: "We have $2M tied up in parts that barely move"
- ✅ **Write-offs**: "We end up scrapping obsolete inventory every year"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "All our parts turn quickly" (no inventory problem = no opportunity)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's your annual inventory carrying cost as a % of revenue?"
- "Do you use consignment models with suppliers to reduce your capital exposure?"
- "Have you considered just-in-time or print-on-demand for slow movers?"

---

### Q4: Digital Integration & ERP Systems 🖥️
**"Do you integrate with your customers' ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, etc.) for automated ordering? And if so, what data do you exchange—inventory levels, lead times, pricing?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates Kwadwo's SAP/MRP advice**: If distributors already integrate, AM can too
- **Tests technical feasibility**: Can we plug into existing systems?
- **Explores data access**: Do distributors have visibility into customer inventory?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **ERP integration exists**: "Yes, we have EDI connections with major customers"
- ✅ **Real-time data**: "We can see their inventory levels and trigger auto-replenishment"
- ✅ **API access**: "We use SAP Business Network for some customers"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "No, it's all manual ordering" (harder to integrate AM)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which ERP systems are most common in Atlantic Canada? SAP? Oracle?"
- "Do customers share their MRP data with you for demand forecasting?"
- "Would you be open to integrating a digital inventory platform into your ordering system?"

### Q5: Partnership Model & Value Proposition 🤝
**"If there was a service that could digitally store CAD files for low-volume parts and manufacture them on-demand within 48 hours—certified for industrial use—would that be something Proax would offer as a premium service to customers? Or would you see it as competing with your traditional distribution model?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Tests partnership hypothesis**: Is Darren a potential ally or competitor?
- **Validates business model**: Would distributors pay for access to digital inventory?
- **Explores go-to-market**: Could we sell through distributors vs. direct to customers?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Partnership interest**: "That could be a great value-add for our customers"
- ✅ **Willingness to collaborate**: "We'd be open to a pilot program"
- ✅ **Customer demand**: "Our customers would definitely pay for faster delivery"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "That would cannibalize our core business" (direct sales only)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What would make this attractive to Proax? A revenue share? A referral fee?"
- "Would you want to white-label the service, or co-brand it?"
- "Which of your customers would be the best fit for a pilot program?"
