## Full Transcript

**Michael:** Hello, hey, my mood, how's it going? Thank you very much. How's everything good, sir?

**Darren:** No, not bad at all. Yeah, I'm in the, I'm in the old vehicle, so it seems to be might my second office from place to place, but it's it's, it's cool. How about yourself about, about?

**Michael:** Thank you very much, really appreciate it for being here with me. I know such a busy day. By the way, I did, when we change this some kind of the schedule a little bit, did you take care of everything? I mean, everything is okay, right?

**Darren:** Yeah, no, I did this, it's yeah, it's what one of the customers at me that did you know Cracking robotics are. Yeah yeah yeah, okay, yes, so we do, I, I have worked with them for, for years, and we did, um, so they've got the head office in, uh, ST John's, Newfoundland where I am now. But I work with the guys out with the Cove, and, uh, they're launching recovery system, so we supply a lot the components that go in, into the their alas. And we originally built their very original panels for it. So, yeah, I was just helping him out on some parts there. But it was a, it was a, I didn't want to, I wanted to make sure we had our meetings. I appreciate you being able to change that as well.

**Michael:** Yeah, that is awesome. I mean, so it's really good because the thing is I've done so many some kind of, because, okay, I'm a little bit excited right now because you're working with Cracking Robotics and part of my some kind of project is also going to, I have to connect with them, but unfortunately I couldn't. So I was really going to be appreciated if you here, just introduce me to someone there to have this some part of 20 minutes, 15 minutes of chitchat to see what's going on with them. I mean, that would be perfectly fantastic. I mean yeah, this is something that you can see likes.

**Darren:** Okay, cool. Let's get, let's get it started.

**Michael:** Yeah okay, let me just introduce myself a little bit. So as I just, yeah, I'm doing in the email, my name is Michael Kyasari and I'm doing my PhD at Dalhous University at the moment. Around a couple of years ago, we came up with a company in Ottawa and they were working on 3D printing and they were working with the US. So they came up with an idea said talking about the building an ecosystem between the different kind of segments or entities and also digital inventory. Recently we entered a program named Lapto Market. And Lapto Market is from Memorial, most of it, and is trying to help young entrepreneurs like us to see that the idea that we do have right now in our mind is going to be validated through different kind of experts like you. So throughout this program, I have to talk with at least hundred people. That's why I'm telling I need more people in my, to some kind of talk with, to some kind of consider my idea to see that is it going to be a perfect pitch for the market or no, I have to some kind of pee that it, I have to work on it to see what's going on. So that was a little bit about me. Would that be okay if you just introduce yourself again a little bit more? I mean, I know everything from your link, yeah, and then we can move forward toward my questions.

**Darren:** Yeah, no, absolutely. So as you know, I'm Darren Wood and I've, well, I've been with Products Technologies now for 14 years. I'm, so actually ever since I, I moved to Canada, but I, and, um, I started in ST. John's, Newfoundland and now we have two locations in ST John's and in Dartmouth. Um, so we have what, 11 people now in Atlantic Canada, but Proax is across Canada. So we have 13 locations. And we specialise in automation and control. So we look at everything, um, within a whole house of different industries from food processing, seafood processing, um, safety, oil and gas mining. I'm, but it's all to do with pretty much any industry can think of pharmaceutical and medical it that, that if anything needs to move and it needs to be controlled, we're involved in it. And, um, so we're heavily involved in robotics, you know, softwares, components. And we do everything from being able to supply the components to building complete solutions. So it it, it's, uh, sounds like a very broad scope, and it is, but automations, automation and, and myself I've been, I've been doing this for a very long time now. I'm started off back in the UK and I was with used to be a process vowel designer, but it's, uh, was, uh, was, uh, there's only so many vowels you can draw before it, it starts to get a little bit, little bit uninteresting. But, and so when it comes to the markets in, uh yeah, and in, um, both Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, we have a really good customer base and kinda help support them with a, a lot of their needs. So it be, uh yeah, I'd love to hear your ideas and I can absolutely powered some of my knowledge and, yeah, we'll have a good discussion. Sounds good.

**Michael:** Perfect perfect, fantastic. So the procedure is like this, I do have a couple of questions and then I'm going to ask that and hopefully you're going to give me as much as information that I need and then at the end of the conversation, I will talk more about my some kind of idea. The reason I'm not talking about it at the beginning is that I've talked with so many people. All of them were nice Canadian. All of them are not Canadians. All of them are some kind of nice people, and every time I talk about my idea, they said, okay, let's give this guy a little bit compliment. Let's say that, okay, this guy is doing something good. No, I need an absolute honest view of this idea because it is crucial for me. I have to know the market, then move forward. Yeah, so if you don't mind, would I do, okay, for starter questions?

**Darren:** Absolutely, man, you go ahead.

## Q1: Inventory Pain Points - Obsolescence & Long Lead Times

**Michael:** Okay, so the very first question that I do have is about the inventory pain points. So in your experience managing industrial automation distribution across Athletic Canada, what percentage of customers request involve parts that are either obsolete, have Lee Long Lee times, or require minimum or quantities that don't make sense for the customer themselves?

**Darren:** Oh, that's a bloody, that's a great question. Is that, that happens quite a lot? It does, mate, it does happen quite a lot. I mean, we have with some of our major manufacturers, you know, obsolescents and parts going into, uh like um, historical components is, is is call like we just, I was actually cracking, it was dealing with a part there. Now that one isn't obsolete yet, but its sister component is that happens a lot. And I mean, it's, um, because, you know, you're dealing with some people who have an install base from 15, 20 years ago and at one point those parts were made and then they went into legacy is the term. But then after legacy is obsolescence and what do you do next? I deal with that all the time.

We're dealing with one with a HMI screen for a machine we actually build, but back then it was the best one to buy and now that my screen no longer exists. So yeah, that's quite key. But sometimes people don't know that and even with us, we don't, you know, we can be a supplier and until that component gets brought up, it's like, it's like, okay, this is now obviously what do we do, you know, and how do we then go about that? How do we look at replacing it? Where is it installed? How is it installed? Yeah, and that's not always easy to find out. It's, it's not, um you know, we do our best when we supply, let's say if we supply a variable speed driver compressor, we can log those serial numbers and we can we, we know where that potential install base is. But as long as we know, then we can say, hey, this is gonna become obsolete, these parts are getting old and these are the recommended spares that you would need for that and always the case, but sometimes we have no clue where this stuff goes and if that happens, then you lose all traceability that component, and that's, that's big, that is absolute deliveries, ah, that is, um, I tell, I tell there's two issues that face deliveries with.

Well, there's a few. I'm absolutely some people, you know, if you're looking at critical spares like what do I have as a machine and how do I hold that? Uh, you got two trends to fight. You got some customers that know the need to hold critical spares, they're in the middle of nowhere. Like if you look at Atlantic Canada especially, there's customers all over the place and none of them are near any of the big senses. And some of them are very forward thinking, like we're gonna hold these spares, but there's others that don't. And, and there's, there's two reasons for that. It's, I don't wanna say they're not that organised, but that is the case sometimes. And some of it is because of cost, like they they they, they roll the dice. So, you know, they run that gauntlet of, of, uh, between holding, you know, it breaking down and the stock, like, you know, there and you look at, uh you know, preventative maintenance. Some people are amazing at that and there's other companies that are not.

And it it, I just had a situation of light actually in a company in central Newfoundland where they, um, the motors, this motor broken down, they were advised to get a stock part, yeah, and they decided not to, and the motor was not on the shelf and, and it stopped their machine. And as a result, we couldn't get a replacement, and we rushed it in, but it still took 10 days. So it was 10 days without that. And so I've now gone through, um, did a complete components list for them of spares, and, but still it sold, you know, it's that, and customers I can only advise, so in my position, I can say this is what you should need. Here are the deliveries, how do we get through that?

I don't think a lot of people don't realize until it's too late, that they're not monitoring the stock, they're not looking at, oh, is this a long delivery item, what happens if we break down? How can we get this? And then what ends up happening as us, as a supplier, of course we want to support people, but sometimes you put in a rock and hard place, you know, and it's it's, it's a tough one cause a lot, you know, we're, we're advising people on parts, and sometimes people look at, like, oh, you're just trying to sell them to get this X ray. And and and you, and you're like, no, I'm actually not, I'm telling you this because if this does fail, we're not in a position where we can necessarily replace it.

But you look at it as a distributor, you got two things, you got the end customer keeping spares himself, but then you, you have us as a distributor. One of things we struggle with is what should we keep in stock and why should we keep it in stock? And also the importance of stock isn't just what's being consumed locally in the market, but what works with each other, you know like if I have a contactor, for example, for starting a motor, then I need the auxiliary contact box. I need the overload with it because everything works in pieces together and you can have the wrong stock sometimes you can have parts which don't make sense together. And because of that stops you from selling those components.

And we're a big distribution company, but we still, we still suffer from that. You won't burn. You know, you won't believe sometimes how, you know, there's not that, there's not that integration between, you know, the system doesn't realise that, you know, you have your purchasing group that might not be technically orientated and they go in and they order parts based on, you know, numerical system. So they're like, this is my investment, this is how much it cost, or I'm gonna get these cause I need this in. But then they don't realize that, okay, here's these parts that they need, but they don't realize they should have bought this as well. And as a result of that, that part that they got doesn't work, and the part that they need to work with this, oh, is now on a four week delivery.

**Michael:** Oh, oh, and trust me, that, yeah, got it. So it's long winded on your, kind of, answer, but I come across yeah, across all that, just does that answer your question, yeah, yeah, for sure, perfect. That's fantastic. I mean, it's not necessarily have to widely answer the question, but get having this all of this great information and real time examples that, that is something I'm looking for.

## Q2: Lead Time Analysis - Standard vs. Emergency

**Michael:** So, yeah, the second question would be about again about the lead time when a customer has an emergency breakdown and need supports immediately, what's your current process? How do lead times and costs compare between this standard timing, this emergency timing? Does it any difference?

**Darren:** Yeah, oh, absolutely, well, if you take, if you take a standard delivery, and I'll use Newfoundland as an example. So, um uh, let's forget the weather for a second, so let's save. The weather's good. We're looking at ground delivery of five days and, and an air delivery of next day. So what ground means as if, so Newfoundland we keep a small stock, but if it's, uh, but in our major stocking warehouses, which would be in, uh, Laval, Quebec or in, uh, in, uh, Mississauga, Ontario, we, that's where our big distribution centres are. So for parts in stock there, and you see that online that then get sent out. So the customer then has a choice of between ground and air. So they might want air cause they need it quickly, but they might not be in a rush or grounds fine.

So that will then come out from us and will be shipped out. Then we also have the capacity if there's a part in stock in our manufacturers, we can also pick up from that manufacturer. So we can either have it shipped to us Mississauga that day and then ship out from Mississauga whether that be ground or air, or can drop ship directly from the, the manufacturer. So in our case might be Phoenix contact or might be a B B, for example. But that can then ship to the customer. And then we can do a thing called drop shipping as well, which is where we ship directly from the manufacturer. And cause of the way we're set up, that's exactly the same as us, so that could save time.

A rush is a really so where we can fall foul in rushes. So normal delivery when it's gone through, we have processes and we have systems in place. You know, we use our ERP system. It gets sent out and it does work quite well. Rushes is where it can become chaos because what happens with a rush is that you have the automated piece, but then you have the human piece still got to go out the door. Someone's got to pick up that pick ticket, someone's got to ship that out the door. And we do have processes in place for this, but it gets missed. And so rush delivery for us in Newfoundland will be sent out same day air. And in order for that to be sent out same day air, it gets picked up by Purilator, but it still has to be registered then the Purilator, and it has to be registered for that delivery. And then it will be sent out, but it takes a person to do it, but it still has to be inputted, put in as a person. So you got that human element and that, that's where it goes wrong.

Yep, yep, because then it entered in, picked up, sent out the door. And the other thing we struggle with is if we have it in stock. So if it's actually in one of our distribution warehouses, there's, um, it's, you're almost guaranteed that you are gonna get it next day if you ask for it. It's pretty good, but the issue comes in when now it's our our, our vendors, so our manufacturer. And that's where the issue comes in because you physically have to pick up on call, because now it's gone from our system to their system. And then you've got no direct link in between to go into theirs to say we need this. And that takes human beings to go through it.

So and then it depends on who you get. Like, if I have issues with my customer, I I, I physically have to do that calling, and it's a shame, but I can't rely on anybody else, cause sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. And you can imagine with what I do. I might be at a customer site, I could be anywhere in Atlantic Canada. I might not have good cell phone service, all this kind of stuff. So then you have to, but you do, it takes, it takes human effort to make sure it goes out.

**Michael:** Got it, got it, makes sense. Perfect. Thank you.

## Q3: ERP Integration & Digital Systems

**Michael:** Uh, so I guess you just answered this question because, uh, oh, yeah, about the digital integration, so do you integrate with your customers ERP systems for automated ordering, and if so, what data do you exchange? Uh, exchange inventory levels, Lee times or pricing.

**Darren:** Yes, that's good. Um, that's a good, uh, that's gonna some couple of ways that we do it, um, with our vendors who actually supply to us. We do want some of the big ones, so we will we've got, we've got access to their stocking systems, okay, and there is a, there is an integration between them and us, so we do have, so for example, on our website, you can go through that. And so the setting of our suppliers which do give us all information, so we can see their stock, and we can see their pricing, which is perfect. But we only see their Canadian stock and also the US stock. But it's all the stuff for Trump at the moment. That's a little bit like, Christ I, that that is, that is out at, but anyway, let's say it's normal.

So some of them, we do see all that information. So, so when the customer, for example, sees that, they can see, see the stock proax, which means it's in one of our warehouses, are stock at the manufacturer and they can see that stock. But, and they can still place the order online and it can ship out. So there is a decent level of automation for our customers. The big ones do have, uh, that capability now everybody, so every customer can use our website and they can see what's online, you can order online, you can look at previous orders in voicing. So there's some good, there's some good integration with that, but they'll, as long as their pricing set up, they'll see pricing as well. Yeah, so they'll see pricing and they'll see what is stock.

Yeah, where it becomes tangly though is manufacturers stock. If it's not stock on their shelf and it has to be built and it has to be made. That's when it starts to, you know, if it's on the shelf, it's great, but ones, if it's not ones, if it's on long delivery, that's, that's where that work then begins to take time. Also, yeah, so that, that's a, uh, and they use, oh God, but the big customers will sometimes even have their own part number setup and everything. I can't remember the process, but there is a process where they can input large orders from their ERP system 2 hours, and it's called EDI. Yeah, like electronica, I think it is. EDI is what they use to do that.

## Pitch Discussion: Digital Inventory & Additive Manufacturing

**Michael:** Yeah, perfect. So I'm done with my questions and actually one last question because you mentioned something in the conversation that we have. Let me just talk about my idea at the beginning, then I can have with that final, last question. So the idea that they do have right now is still working on. It is just being there clear building as a just made building an ecosystem between different entities like the end user, like the Oems, 3D printing facilities and mostly working on additive manufacturing and digital inventory. Recently also, I shift, I got some ideas from, uh, some kind of different industry people about why not try to use their AI in different kind of concept. I mean like using in the digital inventory concept or managing and organizing your inventory, and also another concept that was new to me about predictive maintenance, which I guess you also mentioned that as well. So this is the whole idea yet it's still kind of wake for me. I'm trying to some kind of dig. I'm trying to knock the doors to see that what's going on.

Yeah. As part of the some kind of conversation that we have, you mentioned that at some points you do have the parts, that is fantastic, that is good, but at some point you don't have the part. Is it obsolete? Is it had a problem, is going to take a lot of time to bring it? But have you considered moving toward the digital inventory? Not fully obviously moving toward the digital inventory and using additive manufacturing in your some kind of procedure or not yet.

**Darren:** So how would you, how would you foresee is using additive manufacturing? So what would be the additive manufacturer means that you're offering, uh, different industries.

**Michael:** This, by the way, my pitch is going to be a platform. I'm not really going to give it the no one a physical point. I'm going to exactly encourage them to install the 3D printing facilities on site and using the additive manufacturing to produce to some kind of, make the part that they need. If they can, yeah, try to connect diff some kind of clothes and local additive manufacturing 3D printing sites to predict to some kind of make that part and ship it. Because at the end of the day, I have this some kind of end goal to reduce the downturn cost and obviously reduce the cost that they have to pay for all of the shipping for some kind of the, having the part, maybe that part is not there. This is everything that I do have for my pitch right now.

**Darren:** Yeah, I I, no, I think this this this, this definitely, cause I gonna, I gonna get you some interesting, cause, I mean like, with component parts. I think it's, um, that could make sense. So you building a machine. There's parts that we have, like, we have to go out for that needs to be fabricated, that needs to be made. I bet that's what takes us time. If we're building something, is that fab duck pass, and they are, and all the guys in our value ad team are looking at that. They're looking at additive manufacturing, cause looking at can be manufactured components, and several send them out to other people to do. Cause that is a, there's a cost involved in that. And this time, like like, we're then at the mass of a fabrication shop or whoever that might be.

And, like, I had a tool made up for to put on the end of a robot, and was the the the, the Dell ring which the, you know, the Teflon material on the end, which actually took the longest to get that machined. Like, if you got a 3D printed that, like, you could have made that part, and whether it gave us the finish or not, but maybe it does. But we could have, we could have done that with a 3D printer made ourselves from a drawing. So that stuff is very interesting. I mean, I'd love it. Um, a lot of our components just for example, is, like, we're doing manufactured parts, so, like, it's a terminal block. It's a, it's a variable speed drive. Like, you'd only be able to print the housing sadly frig. I mean, what one day wouldn't be amazing if you could make that stuff, cause, yeah, then you're in, like, how cool would that be. It's, uh, we're we're in a hard, we're in a hard business for 3D printing. We are cause there's some parts sure, yeah, but it'd be what could we make it with, like, it's like in, in, uh, aluminum extrusion. I mean, there's absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's it's it's, it's a tough one. I mean, I sorry, I'm falling down.

**Michael:** Oh, yeah, there we go, making it make emotion safe. I love the idea of, uh you know, I love, I do, I love the, the idea about the manufacturing. That's fantastic. Thank you very much again. Thank you very much for information. I know you passed the 50 minutes. I only have one small and small favor at the end, at the end of the conversation. Because as you know, I have to reach to so many people and reaching to them directly would be very, very different from reaching them throughout someone. So as you just mentioned working with crack and robotics and maybe the cold, yeah, I really would like to connect with those guys. If you have anyone that maybe some kind of can help me from different kind of aspect or perspective of my ideas. Still I'm searching mode. I'm not sure that this Mark, this idea is good or not, but I'm still trying to figure it out. But if you can just introduce me to anyone, that would be very fantastic. I really appreciate that.

**Darren:** Yeah yeah I mean, I'd I'll, I'll send you, cause Robert Hines is, is a really good guy. I'll send you his details, and well, then just send an introduction, because they're, they're the perfect type of people cause they're making stuff. OK, and they they they, that could be great, like, especially if they're, you know, a lot of these people, cause for us added to manufacturing site, if we do an R&D projects, that's where it really comes into its own making those parts and that stuff. That's key, but who's, who's making one offs? Maybe, like, I need to do, I'm testing a machine, so I need to make a prototype of that part. Like, that's where it becomes interesting. Have you also, have you spoke to Poly Unity?

**Michael:** Actually, every time I just talk with someone, they're going to refer around that Paul unity. I'm trying to connect with them, but it's a little bit hard to some, kind of, get an arrangement and get. If you know someone, oh my God, sorry. If you know anyone from there, if you connect me again, that would be fantastic. But, yeah, I still haven't talked with them yet. But I know they're pioneering this field, and I'm trying to each other, like, to get what's going on with them.

**Darren:** Yeah, yeah, cause Mark Gill, Mark Gillingham is the, he's the, the owner and the precedent. I don't know if you know his name, but Mark is like, I'm not, I, I mean, I know Mark. I'm not, like, you know, Ivan done lots of work with him in that, but he is, uh, but he is he is the guy to talk to, like, I, I'm part of a group called the AMC, and, you know, where it's a group of companies across all of Atlantic Canada. And he's, he runs a lot of that. So he he'd be, he'd be really good, he'd be really good for sure.

And also the the, the other person who you should probably talk to is, do you know what the CMA is?

**Michael:** Uh, no.

**Darren:** The CMA is the Canadian manufacturers and exporters. It's across all of Atlantic Canada, but David Hare, David Hare is, is a, he's linked up with everybody, like, he would certainly be a good person to point you in some other directions as well with it, like yeah, a bigger contact.

**Michael:** Yeah yeah, perfect, perfect. Thank you very much for all the same, yeah, that's all I need, perfect, absolutely, okay, excellent. Again, thank you very much for your timing. I know he wasn't your car, sorry, was, or something.

**Darren:** No, hey, man, yeah, I appreciate. It's great to have the conversation. If you got any more question mode, that would be awesome, man.

**Michael:** Yeah yeah, all right, thank you, Royce, yeah, yeah, you choose, man, have a great day, bye.
