## Strategic Interview Questions

### 1. The Material Consistency Challenge

**Question:**

> "In your work with technologies like Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) or Ultrasonic Powder Atomization, what is the biggest technical hurdle when trying to reproduce a 'certified' part locally? Is it the consistency of the feedstock materials or the variability of the environmental conditions at the print site?"

**Why ask:** He leads the portfolio for custom material and powder production. This targets his direct technical expertise in creating novel alloys.

### 2. The "Digital-to-Physical" Verification Gap

**Question:**

> "Having led advanced manufacturing programs at both Exergy and InnoTech, where do you see the biggest 'trust gap' for industry operators? Is it in the lack of standardized digital design files (CAD) or the difficulty of verifying that a printed part actually meets the metallurgical specs of the original?"

**Why ask:** This bridges his time in private consultancy with his current role in de-risking technology for the public sector.

### 3. The Obsolescence & Legacy Parts Headache

**Question:**

> "You manage the MARIOS (Materials and Reliability in Oil Sands) program, which deals with billions in maintenance costs. How often does your team encounter parts that are no longer manufactured, and what is the current 'manual' process for reverse-engineering those components to keep assets running?"

**Why ask:** This hits his specific responsibility for improving equipment reliability in aggressive wear conditions.

### 4. The Scalability Barrier for Startups

**Question:**

> "Through the AMFI (Advanced Manufacturing and Fabrication Initiative), you support many small startup companies. What is the most common reason their 'on-demand' manufacturing solutions fail to scale—is it a lack of technical capability or the administrative burden of meeting industry certification standards?"

**Why ask:** He has a bird's-eye view of the entire Alberta manufacturing ecosystem and sees where the "gaps" are for new technology.

---

### 5. The Capital vs. Inventory Trade-off

**Question:**

> "For the major producers in the MARIOS membership, is the primary driver for adopting additive manufacturing the cost of the part itself, or is it the working capital tied up in physical warehouses across the province?"

**Why ask:** This reveals the financial logic behind why large companies are investing in his programs.

## Research Context & Closing Statement

**When to share:** After asking the questions and understanding their pain points

### Project Introduction

> "I've asked these questions because my PhD research at Dalhousie focuses on **AddManuChain**, a project dedicated to building a decentralized 'Digital Warehouse' for the energy sector. We are developing an AI-driven framework that allows companies to store certified technical data for parts digitally and 'print' them locally, near the site, only when they are needed. By understanding your experience with Advanced Materials and your role in de-risking technology deployment at InnoTech, I am trying to ensure that our platform addresses the real-world certification and material integrity gaps that currently prevent on-demand manufacturing from becoming the standard in the Canadian energy corridor."
