## Core Questions (5)

1. **Translating Lab Innovation to Market Reality**
   - In your experience moving manufacturing innovations from research labs (like ICAMP) to actual products, what's the biggest bottleneck?
   - What separates innovations that scale successfully from those that stay in the lab?

2. **Cross-Technology Integration Challenges**
   - ICAMP housed diverse technologies (3D printing, metal AM, scanning, robotics, CNC, microscopy). What challenges arise when companies try to integrate multiple advanced manufacturing technologies?
   - How do teams typically coordinate when multiple specialized tools and platforms need to work together?

3. **De-Risking & Validation Before Scale**
   - How do you approach risk mitigation when a promising manufacturing innovation is ready for scale-up?
   - What validation or proof points matter most to businesses before committing major investment?

4. **Technology Adoption Patterns in Manufacturing**
   - Looking across all your roles (ICAMP, innovation centers, enterprise platforms, startups), what patterns emerge about why manufacturers adopt new technologies—or don't?
   - What's the difference between a solution that sounds good and one that actually improves metrics like cost, speed, or reliability?

5. **Ecosystem & Partnership Strategy**
   - What types of partnerships accelerate technology adoption in advanced manufacturing?
   - How important are industry associations, OEM relationships, or customer consortiums in scaling a solution?
