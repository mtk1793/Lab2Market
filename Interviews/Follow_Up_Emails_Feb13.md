## ✉️ EMAIL 1: Aaron Plamondon (Interview #34) — HIGHEST PRIORITY
**To:** Aaron Plamondon  
**Subject:** Thank you + Quick coffee on Feb 18 at Dal?

---

Hi Aaron,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me this morning — your insights on the ITB process, the certification challenges, and the reality of getting AM parts onto Navy vessels were incredibly valuable.

A few things really stood out to me:
- Your point about needing the Admiral to say "go do this" before anything moves — that's exactly the kind of governance insight I needed to understand
- The distinction between Irving managing the Halifax class and Thales running AOPS in-service support — that redirects my outreach in a really important way
- Your suggestion to connect with DeepSense at Dal — I'm going to reach out to them this week

I know you mentioned you'll be visiting Dalhousie on the 18th to see the AM capabilities. Since I'm right here on campus, would you have 10-15 minutes before or after your visit to grab a coffee? I'd love to hear your first impressions in person rather than waiting for an email. No pressure at all if the schedule is tight — I completely understand.

Also, whenever you have a chance to connect me with your ship repair and Fleetway contacts, I'd really appreciate it. And I'll plan to follow up with you about a week after the 18th, as you suggested.

Thank you again for your generosity with your time and connections.

Best regards,

## ✉️ EMAIL 2: Nathan Smeenk (Interview #35)
**To:** Nathan Smeenk  
**Subject:** Thank you — and looking forward to that company list

---

Hi Nathan,

Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today — and please thank Eric as well for his input on the AI side of things.

Your perspective was exactly what I needed to hear. A few things that really resonated:
- Your point that the gap in Canadian AM adoption is finance, not technology — that's a different angle than what I've been hearing from the defence and oil & gas side, and it's making me think more carefully about which segments I'm targeting
- The honest feedback on digital inventory — that "a file alone is lipstick on a problem" and you need the full manufacturing recipe (machine, parameters, material specs) — that's sharpening how I position AddManuChain. We need to go beyond the file
- Your vision of Agile outposts across Canada — that tells me the distributed production model has legs, even if the execution path is different

You mentioned you'd send me a list of companies that already have centralized/decentralized AM structures in place. That would be incredibly helpful for my competitive research — whenever you get a chance to pass that along, I'd really appreciate it.

And I'll take you up on the offer to reconnect if the project evolves. Your 22 years in this space gives you a perspective that's hard to find anywhere else.

## ✉️ EMAIL 3: Mike Paulin (Interview #31)
**To:** Mike Paulin  
**Subject:** Thank you for the interview — following up on C-CORE and offshore AM

---

Hi Mike,

Thank you again for your time and insights during our conversation. Your perspective on Arctic offshore logistics, C-CORE's certification work, and the critical components challenge for platforms like Bay du Nord was extremely valuable.

Your point about the harsh environmental conditions in the Arctic and how they create additional certification requirements for any AM parts was something I hadn't fully considered — it adds an important layer to how AddManuChain needs to approach material qualification.

A few follow-up items:
- You mentioned potential connections at C-CORE — if you're able to make an introduction, that would be very helpful for understanding their AM certification capabilities
- Any contacts in the offshore operator space (Equinor, Cenovus) who deal with spare parts challenges would also be valuable

I'll keep you posted on how the project develops. Thank you again for your generosity with your time.

Best regards,

## ✉️ EMAIL 4: Shawn Sooley (Interview #32)
**To:** Shawn Sooley  
**Subject:** Thank you — your "3D printer as a copier" framing was a game-changer

---

Hi Shawn,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. Your insights were some of the most impactful I've received in this entire program.

Your "3D printer as a copier" metaphor — printing what's needed, where it's needed, when it's needed — completely reframed how I think about positioning AddManuChain. And your "Aerospace First" strategy (prove AM in aerospace where certification exists, then bring that credibility to marine/offshore) is something I'm building into the go-to-market roadmap.

Your advice about leading with the business value rather than the AI technology also hit home — "the AI sell is broken" is a line I won't forget.

A few follow-up items:
- If you have contacts in aerospace AM certification (Transport Canada, AS9100 auditors) who might be worth connecting with, I'd appreciate any introductions
- I'd also love to stay connected as the project evolves — your practical perspective is exactly what keeps me grounded

Thank you again for your time and honest feedback.

## ✉️ EMAIL 5: Tyler Beatty (Interview #33)
**To:** Tyler Beatty  
**Subject:** Thank you — your three pillars framework is shaping our approach

---

Hi Tyler,

Thank you for your time and incredibly structured insights during our conversation. Your three pillars framework — Capability, Value, and Certification — gave me a clear way to think about what needs to be proven before any operator will adopt AM for offshore spare parts.

Your specific examples of offshore components (valve housings, pump impellers, pipe fittings) and the real costs of downtime were exactly the kind of concrete data I needed to build a stronger business case.

A few follow-up items:
- If you have contacts at offshore operators or OEMs who deal with spare parts procurement challenges, any introductions would be incredibly valuable
- I'd also appreciate any data or references you might have on typical warehouse costs or downtime costs for offshore operations — that kind of evidence strengthens the pitch significantly

I'll keep you posted on how AddManuChain develops. Thank you again for the time and insights.

Best regards,
