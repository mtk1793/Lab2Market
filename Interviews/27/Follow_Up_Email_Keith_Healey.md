Hi Keith,

Thank you again for our conversation last week — your insights on Bay du Nord as a beachhead and the ERINL funding pathway were incredibly valuable for shaping our direction.

I wanted to follow up on two items:

1. **Brad Elliott (Equinor NL)** — You mentioned you'd be able to make an email introduction. I'd love to connect with him about Equinor's AM work in Norway and their plans for Bay du Nord. Would you be able to send that intro when you get a chance?

2. **ERINL Funding** — I'm starting to prepare an application focused on DNV/Lloyd's certification costs and C-NLOPB engagement. Would you have time for a brief call or email exchange to make sure I'm framing the proposal correctly?

Also, if you happen to have a contact at **C-CORE** for offshore technology validation, that introduction would be very helpful as we build out the certification pathway.

Thanks again for your time and support, Keith — really appreciate it.

Best regards,
