# Interview 27: Keith Healey - Transcript Analysis

**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Interviewee:** Keith Healey, MBA  
**Role:** R&D Project Manager, ERINL | Member, Sustainable Jobs Partnership Council (Federal) | Former Sr. R&D Advisor, Suncor/ExxonMobil  
**Duration:** ~35 minutes  
**Interview Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **EXCELLENT** - Government R&D insider, regulatory pathway expert, Equinor lead

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Key Verdict:** Keith is the **"Government R&D Gatekeeper"** with deep insights into:
1. **ERINL funding criteria** (regulatory safety is #1 priority)
2. **Net-zero transition reality** ("World still needs oil for plastics, clothing - not just fuel")
3. **Regulatory barriers** ("Regulator's limited knowledge is the biggest hurdle")
4. **IP protection concerns** (OEMs see digital files as "loss of business")
5. **Equinor as first mover** (Brad Elliott contact - doing AM in Norway, wants it for Bay du Nord)

**Most Valuable Insight:**
> "I think the key to breaking into industries is with a **new project**. Equinor has high interest in digitalization, AI, and additive manufacturing for Bay du Nord. Since they already have experience in Norway, they're very keen to adopt that here. **That will break down barriers with other oil companies** like Suncor and ExxonMobil when they see what Equinor is doing."

**This validates our beachhead strategy:** Target **Equinor's Bay du Nord (Greenfield project)** as proof point, then scale to Suncor/ExxonMobil.

## 📋 Question-by-Question Analysis

### **Q1: R&D Funding & Pilot Opportunities**

**Question Asked:**
> "As R&D Project Manager at ERINL (Energy Research Foundation), what criteria do you use to select energy innovation projects for funding, and what's the typical pathway from concept to pilot with an offshore operator?"

**Keith's Response (Key Points):**

1. **Funding Depends on Oil Company Interest Cycles:**
   > "It certainly depends on the area of interest from the oil companies. Oil companies go through different cycles of interest - whether it be corrosion, HSE (Health, Safety, Environment), digitalization, additive manufacturing. They'll put out a request for proposal hoping to get applicants, or people like yourself approach ERINL or directly to oil & gas companies to pitch their idea."

2. **Regulatory Safety is #1 Priority for Pilots:**
   > "To get to the pilot stage in oil and gas, they're **highly sensitive about regulatory requirements for safety**. I had experience with a company that had a very innovative digital product they wanted to apply offshore. But at the end of the day, because of the impact on Canadian CSA (Canadian Standards Association) regulations - it was electrical engineering - **Suncor would not allow it to go offshore** because they said it would violate regulatory requirements."

3. **ERINL Funded Certification:**
   > "What we did then was provide funding to help this startup get that **CSA validation or certification done**."

**Hypothesis Validation:**
- ✅ **NH.23 SUPPORTED:** Government R&D funding can de-risk early-stage innovation (ERINL funded CSA certification)
- ✅ **NH.28 SUPPORTED:** Regulatory compliance costs delay technology adoption (Suncor blocked offshore deployment until certification)
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL FINDING:** ERINL will fund **certification costs**, not just R&D

**Strategic Implication:**
Apply to ERINL for **DNV/Lloyd's certification funding**, not just pilot project funding. Frame as "regulatory de-risking."

### **Q2: Energy Transition & Net-Zero Tension**

**Question Asked:**
> "From your work on the Sustainable Jobs Partnership Council and your time at Suncor, how do you see offshore operators managing the tension between extending the life of legacy platforms (2040-2050) while transitioning to net-zero?"

**Keith's Response (Key Points):**

1. **Net-Zero Timeline Was Unrealistic:**
   > "There's been a lot of pressure and hype with net-zero and renewables - that was a global movement, Paris Accords. But once the reality set in, the timeline was **not realistic** in terms of how fast we could get there. The world is still going to need oil - maybe not for burning fossil fuel for cars, but you still need it for **plastics, clothing, and other things we haven't found suitable replacements for yet**."

2. **Government Role in Transition:**
   > "It takes a huge capital investment to go to renewables, and companies are not willing to put money in when it's uncertain about demand. This is where government plays a role - like the $85 million just awarded for expanding charging stations across Canada. Those things have to be built first. You're not going to get an electric car company to come in and make that huge investment to create demand. **It has to be the government.**"

3. **US Policy Impact:**
   > "Where the US pulled back with the Trump government - their dislike of renewables and wanting to continue with fossil fuels - that really put a slowdown. Our economies are tied between Canada, US, and globally."

4. **How Oil Companies Navigate Tension:**
   > "East Coast oil and gas is **low-carbon oil and gas** just by the very nature of it. Making investments in technology that captures CO2 and other methane emissions - invest in technology that reduces harmful greenhouse gases. I think with the global demand, use of technology to reduce carbon footprint - that's how we navigate the tensions between the two different camps."

5. **Federal Government Realism:**
   > "I'm glad to see the current federal government sees a very realistic timeline - it's going to take longer to get there. The world still has consumption for oil and gas. Canada has abundance of this resource, and we **must well capitalize on it for prosperity to fund the transition**."

**Hypothesis Validation:**
- ✅ **NH.27 SUPPORTED:** Energy transition creates demand for rapid asset adaptation (legacy platforms need to operate until 2040-2050)
- ✅ **NH.30 SUPPORTED:** Net-zero commitments create budget for carbon-reducing supply chain innovations
- ⚠️ **POLITICAL CONTEXT:** Federal government is **pro-oil & gas** (not anti-fossil fuel) - frames transition as "decades, not years"

**Strategic Implication:**
Frame digital inventory as **"Carbon Reduction Technology"** (reduces helicopter flights, freight emissions). Aligns with federal Sustainable Jobs mandate.

---

### **Q2B: AI & Digitalization Role (Follow-up)**

**Question Asked:**
> "How do you see the place of AI in this? Do you think AI has advanced too much or does it have a position?"

**Keith's Response (Key Points):**

1. **AI Has Huge Opportunity:**
   > "AI has a huge opportunity for creating efficiencies in oil and gas. The primary first movement was digitalization - getting manual systems into digital, 3D modeling, scenario planning, optimization. But now with AI, there's a huge opportunity because you can **link the collective knowledge on digital optimization with AI**. It's like every expert in the world's mind is brought together and they're all taking on the same problem."

2. **AI Applications in O&G:**
   > "They're able to more actively **predict and recommend** what drill slots to go with first, which wells to develop, which ones have the lowest emissions, keep production vessels' uptime higher, reduce flaring. I think oil and gas needs to **lean in heavily into AI** to get those efficiencies and to crack the emissions issue."

3. **AI for Scientific Research:**
   > "How do we use AI to advance scientific research, **speed it up** to get products and technologies to market faster with proven data that this technology would reduce emissions?"

**Hypothesis Validation:**
- ✅ **AI ENTHUSIASM:** Keith is **pro-AI** (unlike Andrew Smith who was skeptical)
- ✅ **NH.40 REFINED:** AI value is in **optimization and prediction** (not just predictive maintenance)

**Strategic Implication:**
Lead with **"AI-driven supply chain optimization"** when pitching to government (ERINL, Sustainable Jobs Council). They see AI as efficiency enabler.

### **Q3: Regulatory Pathway & C-NLOPB Certification**

**Question Asked:**
> "You spent 7 years managing Canada-Newfoundland Benefits deliverables at Suncor. If a new technology like digital inventory wanted to serve offshore operators, what's the realistic certification pathway through C-NLOPB, and what are the biggest hurdles?"

**Keith's Response (Key Points):**

1. **Biggest Hurdle: Regulator's Limited Knowledge:**
   > "The biggest hurdle is **the regulator itself - their limited knowledge on technology**. That unfortunately makes the path longer. You could have a great technology that's revolutionary for offshore in reducing cost and enhancing safety, but the regulator is going to **put the brakes on** and say 'Hey, this is not traditionally how we do it. We want to see validation proof that this will be safe.'"

2. **Required Studies:**
   > "You have to spend more money on studies - impact studies, validation studies. You'll have to use organizations like **C-CORE** or whoever to validate models to show that what you're trying to do is safe and does not take away from existing safety to the environment."

3. **Education Process:**
   > "It's a whole education to the regulator. You would have to **invite them along** - invite them to milestone reports where the researcher presents and shows 'This is the study we did, these are the calculations, this is the outcome in terms of impacting the metal or whatever.' Over time, you'll need a certification authority to sign off like **Lloyd's** [and DNV]."

4. **Critical Success Factor:**
   > "You would need to get their sign-off, and that's when the regulator would feel comfortable. It'll be very important to **engage the regulator and certified authority along the way**. If you just go out and do the research and then pass it over to the regulator, they're gonna be like 'Ooh, we don't have people here that can really understand this. It's going to take us a year, maybe year and a half to get back to you.' **If you engage them on the way, you'll break down those barriers.**"

**Hypothesis Validation:**
- ✅ **NH.7 SUPPORTED:** Certification is the primary gatekeeper (regulator's limited knowledge is the barrier)
- ✅ **NH.28 SUPPORTED:** Regulatory compliance costs delay adoption (year+ review time if not engaged early)
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL PROCESS:** Must engage C-NLOPB + DNV/Lloyd's + C-CORE **during R&D**, not after

**Strategic Implication:**
ERINL funding should include:
1. C-CORE validation studies
2. DNV/Lloyd's certification
3. C-NLOPB milestone presentations (quarterly updates)

**New Contact:** **C-CORE** (validation organization for offshore technology)

### **Q4: IP Management & OEM Collaboration**

**Question Asked:**
> "From your R&D advisory roles at ExxonMobil and Suncor, why are operators so protective of spare parts IP, and what would it take for an OEM to release part files to a secure digital platform?"

**Keith's Response (Key Points):**

1. **Operator is Caught in the Middle:**
   > "The operator is very concerned about **liability with an OEM**. If you got an OEM who makes specialized valves for an FPSO, and you were saying 'It'd be awesome if we can do additive manufacturing on that because it's a long lead order time. If we had the IP rights and blueprint, we could have that in a digital warehouse and only produce it when needed vs having spares on hand in a warehouse costing us money to mitigate corrosion, pay to keep it in shape, sitting on a shelf.'"

2. **OEM's Fear:**
   > "The tendency is with the OEM equipment suppliers - they see it as a **threat to a loss of business**."

3. **Operator's Fear:**
   > "Oil companies are afraid that if they cross the line in terms of broken an IP commitment and shared a file with an additive manufacturer, they're afraid it could have **legal consequences** and shut down relationships and their ability to have these valves or equipment shipped on time."

4. **Solution: Consortium Model:**
   > "I think what needs to happen is additive manufacturers need to **come together in a consortium, like a society**, and propose a secure digital warehouse and **negotiate a price on the IP for the blueprint**. The OEM manufacturers have to see 'Where's the money for me in this? I just can't give you my IP - I'm giving away my business.'"

5. **Business Case for OEMs:**
   > "They would have to economically find out: Right now companies are buying spares, and even companies side by side are probably buying the same spares but they don't know they have the same equipment. The OEM is making money on that. But **what if you made more money if you sold the digital file?** That's the business case that needs to be understood from additive manufacturers to pitch to the OEM. The OEM has to understand where's their business model, their path on this, how can they make money? They will want **commissions or payment not just for the license, but on everyone that is made**."

**Hypothesis Validation:**
- ✅ **NH.10 SUPPORTED:** IP protection is a major blocker (OEMs see it as "loss of business")
- ✅ **NH.31 SUPPORTED:** IP concerns are heightened in government-funded R&D (operators fear legal consequences)
- ⚠️ **SOLUTION IDENTIFIED:** **Consortium model** + **Per-print royalty** (not just license fee)

**Strategic Implication:**
Revenue model must include:
1. **Upfront license fee** to OEM (one-time)
2. **Per-print royalty** to OEM (ongoing revenue stream)
3. **Consortium structure** (multiple AM providers, not single company)

---

### **Q5: Inventory Holding Costs (Bonus Question)**

**Question Asked:**
> "Can you give me a rough number of how much big industries like ExxonMobil, Suncor pay right now to keep all of those physicals in their stock - human capital, working capital, or anything related to that?"

**Keith's Response (Key Points):**

1. **Millions Per Year (Estimate):**
   > "I couldn't give you an answer because I wouldn't be privy to the supply chain contracts. But if I were to guess, I would say it's **in the millions a year** - just for maintaining the amount of people, resources involved, the systems for tracking these things, and the costs for maintaining each item. Each item probably has a special coating or corrosion inspections. So I would say it's in the millions."

2. **Where Success Will Happen:**
   > "I think where the success will happen - have you spoken to **Brad Elliott with Equinor**? He's a great guy to talk to because he's actually been doing some work in additive manufacturing for Equinor. They're doing it over in Norway and these places. For the **Bay du Nord project** here in Newfoundland that we're trying to get off the ground, there's **high interest for new projects to be using these newer models** like additive manufacturing."

3. **New Projects are the Key:**
   > "I think that is the **key to breaking into industries - with a new project**. They seem to have a lot of interest in digitalization, AI, and additive manufacturing. Since they already have an interest and are involved in that over Norway, I think they're very keen for Bay du Nord to be able to adopt that here. **That will break down the barriers with the other oil companies** like Suncor, ExxonMobil when they see what Equinor is doing."

4. **Network Effect:**
   > "What ends up happening is when someone has something that breaks offshore and they know that Equinor has knowledge, experience, and use of additive manufacturing technology, they're going to reach out and say 'Hey, are you able to get me one of these things made?' That kind of opens doors and breaks down barriers."

5. **Greenfield Advantage:**
   > "Equinor would also have to work with the regulator to get over that hurdle, and they will be the ones to lead that because **they don't have a warehouse set up yet**. Suncor already does, ExxonMobil already does. So Equinor is **Greenfield** - they have an opportunity to make a new model approach in terms of how they're going to manage inventory."

**Hypothesis Validation:**
- ⚠️ **INVENTORY COST:** "Millions per year" (not specific enough - need exact numbers)
- ✅ **BEACHHEAD STRATEGY:** Target **Equinor Bay du Nord (Greenfield)**, not Suncor/ExxonMobil (Brownfield)
- ✅ **NETWORK EFFECT:** Once Equinor adopts, other operators will follow (parts sharing between rigs)

**Strategic Implication:**
**PIVOT TARGET CUSTOMER:**
- ❌ **OLD:** Imperial Oil, Suncor, ExxonMobil (existing warehouses)
- ✅ **NEW:** **Equinor Bay du Nord** (Greenfield, no legacy warehouse, already doing AM in Norway)

## 💣 CRITICAL STRATEGIC INSIGHT: Equinor Bay du Nord is the Beachhead

**Keith's Bombshell:**

> "I think the key to breaking into industries is with a **new project**. Equinor has high interest for Bay du Nord in digitalization, AI, and additive manufacturing. Since they already have experience in Norway, they're very keen to adopt that here. **That will break down barriers with other oil companies** like Suncor, ExxonMobil when they see what Equinor is doing. Equinor is **Greenfield** - they don't have a warehouse set up yet. They have an opportunity to make a new model approach."

**What This Means:**

2. **Bay du Nord is Greenfield** (no legacy warehouse to compete with)
3. **Equinor will lead regulatory pathway** (C-NLOPB engagement)
4. **Network effect to other operators** (Suncor/ExxonMobil will follow)
5. **Brad Elliott is the key contact** (Equinor NL, AM champion)

**Hypothesis Validated:**
- ✅ **NH.22 SUPPORTED:** Sovereign resilience is a value proposition (Bay du Nord is Canadian project)
- ✅ **BEACHHEAD IDENTIFIED:** Equinor Bay du Nord is the **perfect first customer**

## 🎯 Keith's Reaction to Our Pitch

**When Mahmoud Explained the Platform Model:**

**Keith's Response:**
> "I get you - so you're the site that a person goes to, looks up and finds a part they want or need, and you handle behind the scenes finding which company has capability of 3D printing. Takes away the risk of the operator having to have their own manufacturing printer, which is costly. **I think it's a good idea.** I certainly think that it's a **great service offering**. You're reducing the risk to the operator because they don't have to have the warehouse, the equipment to make this thing, the overhead, the people to manage. You're just simply ordering online."

**Keith's Additions:**

1. **Certification as a Service:**
   > "As long as you have the certifications on it that's approved, the standards, whatever - they're going to be okay with it."

2. **OEM Replica vs Premium:**
   > "You can offer OEM replica as an original, or **premium** - as in here's a **better made product**. That's beautiful with additive manufacturing - you can change how it's actually made. Instead of being cast, you can actually make it **stronger**."

3. **Design Improvement Service:**
   > "There's an opportunity to improve on how to make it. If there's a design efficiency that the operator has found, and if you have the ability to work on that with your CAD or manufacturing process as a service, **I think that's another sale there as well**."

**Hypothesis Validation:**
- ✅ **PLATFORM MODEL VALIDATED:** Keith sees value in "marketplace" approach
- ✅ **NEW SERVICE IDENTIFIED:** "Design improvement as a service" (optimize parts based on operator feedback)
