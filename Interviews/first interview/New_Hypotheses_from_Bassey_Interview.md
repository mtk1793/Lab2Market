## Recommended Actions

1. **Add these 8 hypotheses to main tracking sheet** as H39-H46
2. **Test in next 5 interviews** across different customer segments
3. **Prioritize H39** (Communication Platform) - may be THE core differentiator
4. **Build H43** (Quality Matching) into MVP algorithm design
5. **Prototype H44** (Certification Body Decision Support) as unique feature
