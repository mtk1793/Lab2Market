## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. How do you currently handle sourcing parts that are not standard or off-the-shelf?

**Response:**
- **In-house manufacturing:** Build parts internally using existing expertise and capabilities
- **Supply chain partners:** Leverage relationships with large, established supply chain partners
- **Cost acceptance:** Pay premium costs to ensure quality and reliability

**Key Insights:**
- Enginuity maintains dual sourcing strategy (make vs. buy decisions)
- Preference for control through in-house expertise when possible
- Willing to pay higher costs for reliability and quality assurance
- Reliance on established "big" partners suggests trust and track record are critical

**Pain Point Identified:** 🔴 Cost burden of custom parts through traditional supply chain partners

---

### 2. What usually causes delays or issues in getting those parts made?

**Response:**
> "Supply chain delays, especially because of tariffs - big risk in supply chain. We simply can't get it from the US, so we go to Germany."

**Key Issues:**
- **Tariffs:** Major barrier affecting international sourcing decisions
- **Geopolitical supply chain risks:** US sourcing not viable, forcing European alternatives
- **Geographic constraints:** Limited to specific regions (e.g., Germany) increasing lead times
- **Supply chain fragility:** Entire process vulnerable to external factors beyond control

**Key Insights:**
- Trade policy directly impacts operational decisions
- Tariff mitigation requires sourcing from higher-cost markets (Germany vs. US)
- Supply chain diversification is reactive, not strategic
- No apparent contingency planning or alternative supplier networks

**Pain Point Identified:** 🔴 Unpredictable supply chain disruptions with no viable workarounds

---

### 3. Can you describe a recent situation where the process did not go as expected?

**Response:**
- Process deviations depend on individual project characteristics
- No specific example provided (general answer)

**Analysis:**
- Challenges vary by project scope, complexity, and requirements
- May indicate frequent but inconsistent problems
- Could suggest interviewee is cautious about sharing specific failures
- Opportunity to probe deeper in follow-up conversations

**Follow-up needed:** ✅ Request specific case study or anonymized example

---

### 4. How do you currently assess whether a supplier meets your requirements?

**Response:**
- **Documentation-based evaluation:** Use standardized documents to assess and evaluate supplier work
- Formal qualification process in place

**Key Insights:**
- Established supplier vetting procedures exist
- Documentation-heavy process (likely certifications, quality standards, capability matrices)
- Suggests regulatory or quality compliance requirements
- May involve ISO certifications, capability audits, sample evaluations

**Questions for follow-up:**
- What specific documents are required? (e.g., ISO 9001, AS9100, material certifications)
- How long does supplier qualification take?
- What percentage of potential suppliers pass evaluation?

**Opportunity Identified:** 💡 Streamlined supplier verification could reduce time-to-qualification

---

### 5. What parts of this process take the most time or effort internally?

**Response:**
> "Internal communication between us and supply chain management, waiting for documents."

**Time Sinks:**
- **Internal communication bottlenecks:** Coordination between engineering/procurement and supply chain teams
- **Document delays:** Waiting for paperwork, certifications, or approvals
- **Information handoffs:** Multiple touchpoints creating lag time

**Key Insights:**
- Process inefficiency is internal, not just external supplier-related
- Document-centric workflows create delays
- Lack of real-time visibility into supplier status/documentation
- Suggests potential for digital workflow improvements

**Pain Point Identified:** 🔴 Administrative overhead consuming productive time
**Opportunity Identified:** 💡 Digital platform reducing document exchange time and improving communication

---

### 6. What outcomes matter most to you when sourcing these parts?

**Response:**
> "Lead time is a big deal. If we can get the part faster, that would be great."

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Lead time reduction** (Primary priority)
2. Quality and reliability (Implied from Q1 supplier choice)
3. Cost competitiveness (Secondary to speed)

**Key Insights:**
- Time-to-delivery is the #1 pain point
- Current lead times are unacceptable for business needs
- Faster delivery would provide significant competitive advantage
- Suggests project timelines are being negatively impacted by sourcing delays

**Strategic Implications:**
- Speed premium exists in market (willing to pay more for faster delivery)
- On-demand or rapid manufacturing capabilities highly valuable
- Local/regional sourcing preferred if lead times competitive
- Predictability in delivery timelines may be as important as absolute speed

**Pain Point Identified:** 🔴 Extended lead times impacting project delivery and competitiveness

## Summary of Key Pain Points

| Pain Point | Severity | Current Impact | Willingness to Pay for Solution |
|------------|----------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Extended lead times | 🔴 Critical | Project delays, competitive disadvantage | High |
| Supply chain disruptions (tariffs, geopolitics) | 🔴 Critical | Cost increases, limited supplier options | High |
| Internal documentation delays | 🟡 Moderate | Administrative overhead, slow processes | Moderate |
| High costs for custom parts | 🟡 Moderate | Budget pressure | Low-Moderate |

---

## Value Proposition Alignment

### Problems Our Solution Could Address:
1. ✅ **Reduce lead times** through distributed manufacturing network
2. ✅ **Mitigate supply chain risk** via local/regional supplier matching
3. ✅ **Streamline documentation** with digital supplier verification platform
4. ✅ **Transparent pricing** and faster quoting for custom parts

### Validated Hypotheses:
- ✅ Lead time is critical decision factor for custom part sourcing
- ✅ Supply chain reliability issues create market opportunity
- ✅ Documentation/communication bottlenecks exist internally
- ✅ Clients willing to pay premium for speed and reliability

### Questions for Further Validation:
- What lead time would be considered "fast" (days vs. weeks)?
- What percentage cost premium acceptable for 50% lead time reduction?
- Would digital supplier marketplace reduce internal coordination burden?
- How do they currently discover new suppliers?
