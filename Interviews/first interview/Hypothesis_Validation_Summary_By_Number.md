## ✅ STRONGLY SUPPORTED (18 Hypotheses)

| Hypothesis # | Name | Validation Evidence |
|--------------|------|---------------------|
| **H1** | CS.1 - Manufacturers Need Certified Local Suppliers | "Supply chain delays because of tariffs - we simply can't get it from US, so we go to Germany" - Forced to use distant suppliers |
| **H2** | CS.2 - Facilities Have Idle Capacity | "Every line has its own bottleneck" - Unpredictable, variable capacity utilization confirmed |
| **H3** | CS.3 - Labs Need Digital Compliance System | Need for program managers and software; "forecasting is hard to handle and human factor" |
| **H5** | CJ.1 - Source Certified Parts Quickly | **"Lead time is a big deal. If we can get the part faster, that would be great"** - DIRECT QUOTE |
| **H6** | CJ.2 - Fill Machine Capacity | Unpredictable capacity, bottlenecks preventing optimization |
| **H7** | CJ.3 - Process Certifications Efficiently | Complexity of regulations, certification body selection challenges |
| **H8** | CJ.4 - Enable Distributed Manufacturing | "We have a lot of OEM partners we can leverage" - Already doing distributed model |
| **H9** | CP.1 - Weeks Wasted Finding Facilities | Multi-step qualification process, finding right fit is time-consuming |
| **H10** | CP.2 - Expensive Distant Suppliers | Tariffs forcing Germany sourcing instead of US - cost and time penalty |
| **H11** | CP.3 - Certification Proof Difficulty | Documentation-heavy process, "waiting for documents" causes delays |
| **H13** | CP.5 - High CAC Kills Margins | **"Right customer with right problem and right budget - that's the issue to find"** - Lead qualification pain |
| **H14** | CP.6 - Paper-Based Chaos | Administrative overhead, document delays, manual processes |
| **H17** | CG.1 - Find Facilities in Minutes | Current lengthy process vs. desired speed validated |
| **H18** | CG.2 - Cut Shipping 40-60% | Local sourcing would reduce costs vs. distant suppliers |
| **H20** | CG.4 - Maximize Machine Revenue | Capacity optimization challenges confirmed |
| **H21** | CG.5 - Reduce CAC by 50%+ | Pre-qualified leads would dramatically reduce wasted time/cost |
| **H25** | VP.1 - Find Facilities in Minutes | Searchable database would provide immediate value vs. current weeks-long process |
| **H28** | VP.4 - Qualified Client Pipeline | Lead qualification critical, pre-qualified leads highly valuable |

## 🟡 PARTIALLY SUPPORTED (12 Hypotheses)

| Hypothesis # | Name | Why Partial | Notes |
|--------------|------|-------------|-------|
| **H4** | CS.4 - OEMs Want Distributed Mfg | Evidence FOR: Using OEM partners / Evidence AGAINST: Already doing it, not blocked | **PIVOT NEEDED:** Change from "enable" to "optimize" existing distributed mfg |
| **H12** | CP.4 - Machines Sitting Empty | Capacity issues confirmed, but framed as unpredictable/variable not "sitting empty" | More complex than simple idle time |
| **H15** | CP.7 - Reactive Enforcement Only | Manual monitoring confirmed / Not explicitly stated as "reactive" | Need regulatory authority interview |
| **H16** | CP.8 - Can't Trust Distributed Mfg | Quality concerns exist / But they ARE using distributed mfg | **REFRAME:** "Quality consistency challenges" not "trust deficit" |
| **H19** | CG.3 - Instant Proof of Compliance | Documentation delays validated / "Instant proof" not explicitly desired | May be nice-to-have not must-have |
| **H22** | CG.6 - 60% Less Admin Time | Admin burden confirmed / 60% specific number not validated | Already using some automation |
| **H23** | CG.7 - Real-Time Compliance Visibility | Staying current with regs challenging / More relevant to authorities than manufacturers | Different use case for different segment |
| **H24** | CG.8 - Distributed Mfg with Quality Assurance | Using distributed model / Quality already managed with existing tools | Improvement desired, not enablement |
| **H26** | VP.2 - Prioritize Nearby Facilities | Local sourcing desired / Algorithm mechanism not tested | Should be filter not forced priority |
| **H27** | VP.3 - One-Click Compliance Proof | Doc delays confirmed / "One-click" interaction not validated | Focus on speed not clicks |
| **H29** | VP.5 - Build Credibility with Badges | Proving credentials important / Badge system not validated as solution | Direct cert proof more important |

| **H30** | VP.6 - Reduce Admin Time 60% | Admin burden confirmed, 60% number not tested | Quantify time savings, validate throughput claim |
| **H31** | VP.7 - Real-Time Compliance Tracking | Interviewee is manufacturer not regulatory authority | Interview compliance officers |
| **H32** | VP.8 - Standardized Quality Across Facilities | Distributed mfg confirmed, standardization not tested | Ask about quality processes, IP concerns |

## ❌ CONTRADICTED / REJECTED (2 Hypotheses)

| Hypothesis # | Name | Why Contradicted | Strategic Implication |
|--------------|------|------------------|----------------------|
| **H4** | CS.4 - OEMs Want Distributed Mfg | Assumes OEMs "want to enable" but are "blocked" / Reality: ALREADY doing it | **PIVOT:** Reframe as "OEMs struggle to manage distributed mfg efficiently" - optimization not enablement |
| **H16** | CP.8 - Can't Trust Distributed Mfg | Assumes avoidance due to trust issues / Reality: Actively using distributed model | **REFRAME:** "Quality consistency challenges" not "trust deficit" - they trust enough to use it |
