## Core Questions (5)

1. **Validation Bottlenecks in Advanced Manufacturing**
   - From concept development through production scaling in additive manufacturing, where do teams spend most effort and time?
   - What's the biggest gap between your R&D pace and your ability to move a validated process into production?

2. **Traceability & Compliance in Regulated Sectors**
   - In aerospace and biomedical applications, what traceability and documentation requirements are non-negotiable?
   - How much of your team's effort goes to documenting, tracking, and validating supplier quality versus actually developing new capabilities?

3. **Materials Sourcing & Cross-Functional Coordination**
   - When you're developing a new material or process, how do decisions get made about powder sourcing, testing protocols, and supplier qualification?
   - What coordination challenges exist between your materials team, process engineers, quality assurance, and production?

4. **Speed to Market in High-Tech Manufacturing**
   - How long does it typically take from identifying a new commercial opportunity to having something you can actually produce at scale?
   - What's the disconnect between promising lab results and being ready to serve customers?

5. **Data & Decision-Making in R&D-to-Production**
   - How do teams currently track what's working, what's failed, and why in your development pipeline?
   - If you had complete visibility into materials data, process parameters, quality outcomes, and supplier performance across all your projects, what would actually change?

## Bonus Questions (2)

**Bonus 1:** What's the biggest misconception people outside of advanced manufacturing have about how R&D actually becomes production?

**Bonus 2:** If you could redesign your team's tools and workflows to get something from concept to qualified production 50% faster, what would that look like?

## At End of Interview

*Based on what you've described about coordination challenges, data gaps, and validation complexity, we're exploring whether a platform that integrates traceability, process tracking, and cross-functional visibility could help teams move from R&D validation to production faster. Does that seem like a real problem you're facing?*
