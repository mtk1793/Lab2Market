## Strategic Interview Questions

### 1. The "Design-to-Reality" Handoff Friction

**Question:**

> "Tell me about the last part you designed that needed to be manufactured externally. Walk me through what happened after you finished the design."

**Follow-ups:**
- "Who handled getting it made?"
- "What information got lost or miscommunicated in that handoff?"
- "How long did the whole process take from design-complete to part-in-hand?"
- "What was the most frustrating part?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real handoff story reveals friction points (not assumptions)
- Identifies where information breakdown occurs in workflow
- Tests whether engineer experiences pain OR if it's abstracted away
- Validates H24 (streamlined workflow) with concrete evidence

**Hypotheses tested:** H39 (communication platform), workflow integration requirements

---

### 2. The "Trusted Supplier" Gut Check

**Question:**

> "Tell me about a time you or your team needed to find a machine shop or supplier. How did you find them?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Did you find them through Google, a referral, or some other way?"
- "What made you trust they could do the job?"
- "If you found someone with a great website but no referral, what would they need to show you to trust them?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real supplier selection reveals ACTUAL trust factors (not hypothetical)
- Tests online platform credibility requirements
- Validates what "proof" young engineers need (reviews? certifications? portfolio?)
- Reveals generational differences in trust-building

**Hypotheses tested:** H29 (certification badges), H25 (find facilities online), platform trust barriers

---

### 3. Precision Matching vs. Self-Filtering

**Question:**

> "Think about the last time you helped search for a supplier. How many did you look at before making a decision?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Did you look at all of them in detail, or skim most and deep-dive on a few?"
- "If a system could show you just the top 3 matches based on your requirements, would you trust that? Or would you want to see all options?"
- "What would make you trust that the matching was done correctly?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real search behavior reveals ACTUAL vs. stated preferences
- **CRITICAL VALIDATION** of H43 (quality-over-quantity matching) from user perspective
- Tests generational preference: Do digital natives want curation OR control?
- Reveals trust requirements for algorithmic recommendations

---

### 4. The "Real-Time Status Update" Annoyance Factor

**Question:**

> "Tell me about the last time you worked with an external supplier on a project. How did you stay updated on progress?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "How often did you have to reach out to ask 'Is it done yet?'"
- "How much time did you spend each week just chasing status updates?"
- "If you could get automatic real-time updates, how much time would that save you?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Concrete time quantification reveals true pain severity
- **CRITICAL VALIDATION** of H39 (real-time communication platform) from daily user perspective
- Tests whether this pain exists at EIT level or only management level
- Validates if real-time tracking is "nice to have" vs. "time saver"

---

### 5. IP Protection Concerns for Cloud Platformsm adoption

**Question:**

> "When you send CAD files to a manufacturer for a quote, how do you usually send them? Email? File transfer? In person?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Have you ever hesitated to send a file because of IP concerns?"
- "If there was a secure platform that could instantly quote a part but required uploading your CAD file, would you use it?"
- "What security features would make you comfortable uploading?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Past file-sharing behavior reveals TRUE concerns (not hypothetical fears)
- Tests IP protection as real barrier vs. perceived barrier
- Validates whether CAD integration is opportunity OR deal-breaker
- Reveals security requirements: encryption? NDAs? access logs?
- Validates what security/privacy features are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves

**Hypotheses tested:** NEW - CAD integration barriers, IP protection requirements, cloud adoption comfort

## Follow-Up / Probing Questions

### If he mentions supplier discovery challenges:
- "How long does it typically take you to find a suitable supplier for a custom part?"
- "Do you use any online directories or platforms, or is it mostly Google and referrals?"
- "Have you ever walked away from a design solution because you couldn't find a manufacturer who could make it?"

### If he mentions communication frustrations:
- "What communication tools does Atlantic XL use with external partners? Email, phone, Slack, Teams, something else?"
- "Which supplier communications are most frustrating—technical clarifications, status updates, payment/invoicing, or something else?"
- "Would you prefer to communicate inside a platform (like messaging on Amazon) or outside it (email/phone)?"

### If he's comfortable with technology:
- "Do you expect to be able to use business tools on your phone, or is desktop-only acceptable?"
- "What apps or platforms do you use daily for work? Which ones do you wish existed but don't?"
- "If you were designing a marketplace for engineers to find manufacturers, what would be your #1 must-have feature?"

### If he mentions career aspirations (aerospace/NordSpace):
- "I noticed you follow NordSpace. Is aerospace where you'd like to end up long-term?"
- "Do you see distributed manufacturing or additive manufacturing playing a bigger role in aerospace/advanced industries?"
- "What skills are you trying to develop to move in that direction?"

## Research Context & Closing Statement

**When to share:** After asking the questions and understanding his workflow pain points

### Project Introduction

> "I've asked these questions because my PhD research is building **AddManuChain**, a platform designed to make it faster and easier for engineers like you to find certified manufacturers for custom parts—whether that's CNC machining, 3D printing, or other processes. What's valuable about your perspective is that you represent the *actual user* of this kind of platform: someone who's hands-on with the design work and needs suppliers quickly, reliably, and without the headache. Your feedback on what would make you trust and use a platform like this is incredibly valuable, because if it doesn't work for someone like you, it won't get adopted. I'd love to stay in touch as we build this out and potentially have you test early versions if you're interested."

## Interview Strategy Notes

**Opening approach:**
- Start with workflow question (non-threatening, gets him talking about daily work)
- Emphasize you're interested in *his* experience, not just management perspective
- Ask "how do you..." questions rather than "does Atlantic XL..." questions (personal vs. corporate)

**Mid-interview:**
- Dig into trust requirements (critical for platform adoption)
- Test quality-over-quantity matching from user perspective
- Validate real-time communication value

**Closing:**
- Explore file upload/IP concerns
- Ask about ideal features (aspirational UX design)
- Gauge early adopter/beta tester interest

**Post-interview:**
- If enthusiastic, recruit as potential beta tester
- Ask for feedback on mockups/wireframes later
- Request introductions to other early-career engineers at Atlantic XL or Memorial University

## Comparison Framework: John vs. Sean

| Question Area | John's Perspective (Expected) | Sean's Perspective (Expected) |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Platform Value** | Time savings, ease of use, better tools | ROI, capacity utilization, revenue growth |
| **Decision Criterion** | "Would I use it?" | "Would we buy it?" |
| | **Trust Signals** | Reviews, certifications, UX design | Case studies, references, contracts |
| **Adoption Barrier** | Complexity, learning curve | Cost, integration, risk |
| **Primary Concern** | Does it work well? | Does it deliver business value? |

**Both are necessary for success:**
- Sean's buy-in = platform gets purchased
- John's buy-in = platform gets used consistently
