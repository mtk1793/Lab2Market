   - Likely more open to new tools/platforms than established professionals

4. **Ground Truth:**
   - Sean can speak to *strategic* value of a platform
   - John can speak to whether he'd *actually use it* day-to-day
   - Critical for product-market fit: "Would a 26-year-old engineer use this tool?"

### Expected Role at Atlantic XL

Based on EIT status and company type, John likely:
- Works on project teams executing marine/offshore engineering projects
- Uses CAD software daily for mechanical design
- Communicates with suppliers to source parts/components
- Participates in design reviews and technical problem-solving

## Key Questions to Explore

### Daily Workflow

1. **Design to Sourcing Workflow:**
   - When you complete a mechanical design that requires a custom part, what's the next step?
   - Do you personally source the supplier or hand that off to someone else?
   - What information do you need to provide to the sourcing/procurement team?

2. **Software \u0026 Tools:**
   - What software tools do you use daily? (CAD, communication, project management)
   - Which tools *help* you get work done vs. *slow you down*?
   - If you could eliminate one manual task with automation, what would it be?

### Supplier Discovery \u0026 Interaction

3. **Finding Suppliers:**
   - When Atlantic XL needs a specialized manufacturing capability, how do you find potential suppliers?
   - Do you use Google, LinkedIn, directories, referrals, or something else?
   - What makes a supplier's website trustworthy vs. sketchy?

4. **Communication Challenges:**
   - When coordinating with external suppliers/partners, what communication method works best?
   - Have you ever experienced a project delay due to miscommunication with a supplier?
   - What percentage of your emails/messages are just chasing status updates?

### Technology Adoption

5. **Platform Trust:**
   - Would you use an online marketplace to find manufacturing suppliers, similar to how you might use Amazon for consumer products?
   - What would make you trust such a platform? (reviews, certifications, guarantees, etc.)
   - What concerns would you have about using a new platform?

6. **File Sharing \u0026 IP:**
   - Are you comfortable uploading CAD files to cloud platforms (like Dropbox, Google Drive, OnShape)?
   - What security features would you need before uploading sensitive design files to a marketplace?
   - Have you ever had concerns about IP protection with external suppliers?

### Career Aspirations

7. **Future Vision:**
   - You follow NordSpace and seem interested in aerospace—do you see yourself staying in marine/offshore or transitioning to aerospace?
   - What skills/technologies are you trying to learn to advance your career?
   - Do you see distributed manufacturing or additive manufacturing as part of the industry's future?

## Expected Segment Classification

**Primary Segment:** CS.2 (3D Printing Facilities) - Technical User  
**Secondary Insight:** Early Adopter Profile Assessment

**Rationale:**
- Works at Atlantic XL (a facility/service provider)
- Represents the *user* of any platform (not the decision-maker/buyer)
- Critical for UX, adoption, and daily workflow validation
- Generational perspective (digital native vs. analog-to-digital converts)

---

## Interview Preparation Notes

**John's Profile Suggests:**
- **Digital Native:** Graduated 2022 → comfortable with modern software, cloud tools, apps
- **Entrepreneurial Curiosity:** Follows business success stories, regional innovation
- **Aspirational:** Interested in aerospace (cutting-edge) while working in marine/offshore (practical)
- **Early Career:** Eager to learn, less set in his ways than senior engineers

**How to Approach:**
- Emphasize practical workflow improvements (save time, reduce frustration)
- Ask about tools he wishes existed but don't
- Explore mobile/app expectations (younger users expect mobile-first)
- Discuss career growth and skill development (professional value beyond just job tasks)

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- If he defers to management for all answers ("I'd have to ask my boss")
- If he's uncomfortable discussing challenges (company loyalty vs. honest feedback)
- If he hasn't actually done supplier sourcing (limited direct experience)

**Opportunities:**
- If he's enthusiastic about technology, he could be a beta tester/pilot user
- Potential brand ambassador for platform among younger engineers
- Could provide UX feedback from target user demographic

## Strategic Value for AddManuChain

### Why Interview John Alongside Sean?

**Complementary Perspectives:**
- **Sean (Director):** Strategic value, business case, ROI, management buy-in
- **John (EIT):** Daily usability, workflow integration, actual adoption likelihood

**Decision-Maker vs. End-User:**
- **Sean** will decide *whether* to use the platform (business decision)
- **John** will determine *whether it gets used consistently* (adoption decision)

**Product Development Insights:**
- Sean validates the *business model*
- John validates the *product-market fit*
- Both are necessary for platform success

### Red Flag Scenarios:

❌ **Sean loves it, John won't use it:** Platform won't get adopted (management buy-in ≠ user adoption)  
❌ **John loves it, Sean won't pay:** Platform won't get purchased (users want it but no budget authority)  
✅ **Both see value:** Strong signal for product-market fit at multiple organizational levels

## Interview Quality Assessment (Pre-Interview)

**Expected Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High - Critical User Perspective)

**Why high value:**
- ✅ Validates whether target users would *actually use* the platform
- ✅ Generational insights (digital native expectations)
- ✅ Ground-truth on daily workflow pain points
- ✅ UX and adoption barrier identification

**Potential limitations:**
- ⚠️ Limited decision-making authority (can't speak to budget/procurement)
- ⚠️ Early career = less industry experience than senior engineers
- ⚠️ May not have supplier sourcing responsibilities yet

**Mitigation:**
- Pair John's interview with Sean's for complete picture
- Focus on usability and adoption questions (not strategy)
- Ask about *aspirational* workflows ("how would you want this to work?")

---

**Interview Status:** Pending  
**Next Steps:**
1. Schedule interview (potentially joint with Sean or back-to-back)
2. Prepare questions focused on daily workflow and technology adoption
3. Validate H39 (communication), H43 (matching), H25 (discovery) from user perspective
4. Explore generational differences in platform expectations (mobile, UX, trust)
5. Assess early adopter potential and beta testing willingness
