**Context:** Andrew is a Six Sigma Black Belt and Lean Facilitator. He sees physical inventory as "waste."

**His Challenge:**
- Traditional Lean says "reduce inventory to minimum."
- But safety-critical industries require "insurance stock" (contradicts Lean).
- **How to apply Lean principles to regulated industries?**

**Our Solution:**
- **Digital inventory IS Lean** (zero physical waste, infinite shelf life).
- **Print-on-demand = pull system** (classic Lean - produce only when needed).
- **Working capital freed up = cash flow improvement** (CFO-level Lean metric).

---

### Pain Point #3: **Quality Traceability in Distributed Manufacturing** (QA Director)
**Context:** Andrew is QA Director at JVPLabs. He needs full traceability for medical devices (ISO 13485).
