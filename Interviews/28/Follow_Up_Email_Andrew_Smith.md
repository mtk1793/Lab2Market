Hi Andrew,

Thank you for the great conversation — your "reality check" on targeting specific pain points over broad ecosystem plays was exactly what I needed to hear. The <50 units threshold and the helicopter-sharing insight really sharpened our focus.

I wanted to follow up on a couple of things:

1. **Dave at CME Nova Scotia** — You mentioned you could introduce me to Dave. I'd love to connect with him to gather data on emergency maintenance and downtime incidents in Nova Scotia manufacturing. Would you be able to make that intro?

2. **Collab Markup** — You mentioned they do AI-driven QA for AM locally in NL. Do you have a contact there I could reach out to?

3. **In-person meeting at Dal** — Would you still be open to meeting at Dalhousie to continue the conversation? Happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks again, Andrew — your perspective was really valuable.

Best regards,
