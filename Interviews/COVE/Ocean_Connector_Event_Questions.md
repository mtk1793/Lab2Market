# COVE Ocean Connector Event — Questions
## Event: Turning Breakthrough Concepts into Operational Capability
**Date:** February 26, 2026  
**Time:** 4:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m. AST  
**Location:** COVE (Centre for Ocean Ventures and Entrepreneurship)  
**Speakers:** 
- Ultra Maritime
- Hawboldt Industries
- Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC)

**Theme:** How technologies move from concept to operational reality through modular design, partnerships, and at-sea testing

## 5 Core Questions (for event use)

**Q1 — From concept to operational deployment:**
> *"What is the typical timeline and critical path from a breakthrough marine/defence concept to something actually deployed operationally at sea? And what are the 2–3 biggest obstacles that slow that transition?"*

**Follow-ups:** How much does at-sea testing cost relative to land-based validation? Do you test prototypes on real vessels as part of the vetting process?

---

**Q2 — Modular design as enabler:**
> *"You mentioned modular design is key to adoption. How does modularity change the business model, supply chain, or integration process compared to fixed, monolithic solutions? What are the trade-offs?"*

**Follow-ups:** Does modularity help with certification and regulatory approval? Can customers easily swap modules, or is there vendor lock-in?

---

**Q3 — Dual-use opportunities and market expansion:**
> *"Many defence technologies also work in commercial marine. How do you identify and navigate dual-use pathways? Are there regulatory or procurement differences between selling to defence vs. commercial operators?"*

**Follow-ups:** Does developing for defence first help or hinder commercial adoption? How do you structure IP and contracts across both markets?

---

**Q4 — Partnership and co-development:**
> *"How do you choose technology partners (OEMs, integrators, component suppliers) early in the development cycle? And how do you structure those partnerships so partners are incentivized to stick with you through the long validation phase?"*

**Follow-ups:** What goes wrong most often in partnerships? How do you de-risk partner relationships before committing to integration?

---

**Q5 — At-sea testing and validation:**
> *"At-sea testing is expensive and logistically complex. How do you design a testing campaign that actually de-risks operational adoption without burning capital? And who funds that testing — the developer, the customer, or shared?"*

**Follow-ups:** What failure modes do you typically discover at sea that you missed in simulation or tank testing? How do you scale from small trials to fleet deployment?

## 2 Bonus Questions

**B1 — Certification and regulatory pathways:**
> *"For marine defence technologies, what does the certification and regulatory approval process look like (e.g., classification societies like Lloyd's Register, naval design authorities, etc.)? How much does certification cost and how long does it take?"*

---

**B2 — Fit for digital supply chain enablement:**
> *"If a platform existed that could digitize your spare parts inventory, connect you to qualified AM manufacturers for replacement components, and automate certification records — how would that change your maintenance and logistics model for deployed systems?"*

---

## Suggested Use in Event

- **Networking time (4:00–4:30 p.m.):** Use Q1 and Q2 as icebreakers with individual speakers.
- **Q&A session (if panelists take questions):** Lead with Q3–Q4 to surface competitive intelligence and partnership insights.
- **B1/B2:** Ask during one-on-one follow-up conversations or informal networking.

---

## Key Contacts to Prioritize
- **Ultra Maritime:** Focus on Q1, Q2, Q3 (dual-use transition).
- **Hawboldt Industries:** Focus on Q4, Q5 (partnership and at-sea testing).
- **DRDC:** Focus on Q1, B1 (certification and regulatory pathways).
