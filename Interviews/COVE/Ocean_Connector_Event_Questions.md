# COVE Ocean Connector Event — Speaker-Specific Questions
## Event: Turning Breakthrough Concepts into Operational Capability
**Date:** February 26, 2026 | 4:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m. AST  
**Location:** COVE (Centre for Ocean Ventures and Entrepreneurship)  
**Prepared by:** Mahmoud Kiasari | AddManuChain | Lab2Market Oceans Program

---

> **Context for all conversations:** AddManuChain is a digital platform connecting OEMs, certified 3D print centres, and operators to deliver on-demand, certified spare parts — targeting offshore O&G, maritime, and Canadian defence. We use a DRM pipeline (cryptographic print tokens) to protect OEM IP while enabling authorized on-demand manufacturing. Atlantic XL (St. John's, NL) is our anchor partner — the first Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility in the Americas.

# 🔵 ULTRA MARITIME

**Who they are:** Ultra Maritime is a global defence electronics company producing sonar, acoustic sensors, and underwater systems. They supply to NATO navies including the Royal Canadian Navy. Their systems are integrated into submarines, surface vessels, and UUVs — long-lifecycle assets with complex maintenance requirements and proprietary OEM components.

---

### Q1 — Spare parts lifecycle for long-service defence electronics

> *"Ultra Maritime systems go into vessels that operate for 20–30 years. What does the spare parts supply chain actually look like for your hardware over that lifecycle — is it pre-positioned spares kits, OEM warehousing, or is there a long-tail sourcing problem as production runs end? And at what point in a system's life does parts availability become the bottleneck rather than the technology itself?"*

**Follow-up:** What's the most painful class of parts to source at year 15 of a platform's life — PCBs, mechanical housings, transducer assemblies?

---

### Q2 — OEM IP and the print-on-demand possibility

> *"One of the barriers we keep hearing from defence OEMs is IP control — the specs for a part exist in your engineering files, but allowing a third party to manufacture it using those specs creates IP and liability exposure. For Ultra Maritime, when a navy asks for a replacement mechanical or structural component — housings, brackets, connectors — how do you handle that today? And is there a category of non-critical parts where you'd be comfortable with an authorized third party manufacturing from your approved specs, if the right traceability and IP protection existed?"*

**Follow-up:** Has Ultra Maritime lost a maintenance contract or taken a performance penalty because a replacement part took too long to source?

---

### Q3 — Classification and certification: what does a third-party manufactured component need to pass?

> *"If a shipyard or naval base wanted to 3D-print a replacement mechanical housing for an Ultra Maritime sensor system — not the electronics, just the enclosure — what certification or qualification would that part need to pass before it could go back into service on a Royal Canadian Navy vessel? Is that a Lloyd's/DNV class certification question, a DND technical authority question, or an Ultra Maritime factory acceptance question?"*

**Follow-up:** Has Ultra Maritime ever had a component manufactured by a third party under a licensed agreement? What did that qualification process look like?

---

### Q4 — Dual-use: from navy platforms to commercial maritime

> *"Ultra's sonar and acoustic systems appear in both naval and commercial applications. When a navy-developed system transitions to commercial maritime — offshore survey vessels, subsea inspection — does the supply chain and maintenance model change significantly? Is there a version of your spare parts model for commercial operators that's more flexible or accessible than the defence procurement channel?"*

**Follow-up:** Is there a commercial maritime operator in Atlantic Canada that uses Ultra systems and would be your warm introduction for a spare parts conversation?

---

### Q5 — COVE and Halifax as an AM hub: does geography matter for defence supply chain?

> *"Ultra has a significant presence in Halifax. The Canadian government is investing heavily in domestic defence manufacturing through initiatives like the National Shipbuilding Strategy. If a Lloyd's-certified AM facility — like Atlantic XL here in St. John's — could manufacture authorized replacement components for naval defence electronics, does Halifax-to-St. John's proximity matter for your maintenance and logistics model? Or does defence procurement override geography?"*

**Follow-up:** Does being in Halifax give you visibility into Irving Shipbuilding's supply chain needs? Is there a spare parts angle there we should be looking at?

---

# 🟢 HAWBOLDT INDUSTRIES

**Who they are:** Hawboldt Industries is a Canadian marine equipment manufacturer based in Chester, NS — producing winches, davits, deck machinery, and mechanical handling systems for commercial marine, offshore, and defence vessels including RCN ships. They are an established Canadian OEM whose equipment is exactly the kind of high-value, long-lifecycle mechanical hardware where custom parts availability becomes a serious operational problem.

---

### Q1 — The reality of spare parts for custom deck machinery

> *"Hawboldt manufactures custom winches, davits, and deck handling systems — by definition, these are low-volume, high-complexity parts. What does your spare parts model look like today for customers operating your equipment 10 or 15 years after original manufacture? Do you maintain stock, manufacture on order, or does the customer pre-purchase a spares kit at installation?"*

**Follow-up:** What's the longest a customer has waited for a replacement part for a Hawboldt system? What category of parts causes the most delay — gearing, bearings, hydraulic components, structural weldments?

---

### Q2 — Digital blueprints and AM: could a certified facility print a Hawboldt component?

> *"Additive manufacturing is being used for marine mechanical components — impellers, brackets, housings, non-structural gearbox components — in offshore and naval applications. For a Hawboldt system, which categories of replacement parts are candidates for on-demand AM manufacturing, and which aren't? And if a certified AM facility had your engineering specs and printed a compliant replacement — what would stop you from supporting that from a warranty and liability perspective?"*

**Follow-up:** Has Hawboldt ever done any AM for prototyping or production? If yes — what printer/material/certification environment?

---

### Q3 — RCN and DND relationships: how does federal defence procurement affect your spare parts model?

> *"Hawboldt equipment is on Royal Canadian Navy vessels. That means your spare parts are part of DND's managed supply chain. Does DND's procurement process for Hawboldt replacement parts actually work operationally — does it get the part to the vessel when it's needed? Or is the formal DND channel slow enough that you end up supporting maintenance teams informally, outside the contract?"*

**Follow-up:** Is there a specific vessel class or RCN program where the spare parts situation could be dramatically improved? Who at DND should we be talking to about the managed supply chain problem?

---

### Q4 — Canadian manufacturing and the NSS: what's the opportunity for domestic AM supply chain?

> *"The National Shipbuilding Strategy is supposed to build domestic maritime manufacturing capability across Canada. Hawboldt is already an established Canadian marine OEM. From where you sit — is the NSS actually creating new domestic manufacturing capacity, including for replacement parts and MRO, or is it primarily a shipbuilding program that leaves the supply chain still largely imported? Where should a company like AddManuChain plug into the NSS supply chain?"*

**Follow-up:** Is there a Tier 1 or Tier 2 subcontractor in the NSS program that deals with MRO and spare parts that we should be speaking to?

---

### Q5 — Partnership model: what would an OEM-AM collaboration look like for Hawboldt?

> *"Here's a direct question: if AddManuChain approached Hawboldt with a proposal to digitize the engineering specs of your most-requested replacement parts — under an IP agreement where we issue a cryptographic print authorization to a certified AM facility only when a verified Hawboldt customer requests it — is that a model Hawboldt would consider? What would you need to see before you'd say yes?"*

**Follow-up:** Who at Hawboldt owns the spare parts and aftermarket relationship — is that engineering, sales, or operations?

---

# 🟠 DEFENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CANADA (DRDC)

**Who they are:** DRDC is the federal S&T agency for Canadian defence — conducting research and transitioning technologies into operational capability for the Canadian Armed Forces. They bridge the gap between academic/startup innovation and DND operational procurement. DRDC Atlantic in Dartmouth/Halifax focuses on maritime, underwater systems, and naval technology. Their role in this event is specifically about how breakthrough concepts become operational capability — which is exactly the challenge AddManuChain faces.

---

### Q1 — How does a new technology actually get from TRL 4 to operational deployment in the RCN?

> *"DRDC's mandate is transitioning technology into operational capability. What does that transition actually look like for a physical manufacturing or supply chain technology — not a sensor or software, but something that changes how ships are maintained or equipped? What are the mandatory gates: technology demonstration, safety case, procurement vehicle, training? And how long does the realistic path take from first DRDC engagement to operational deployment on an RCN vessel?"*

**Follow-up:** Is there a fast-track mechanism for technologies that address an active operational gap — something the Navy urgently needs — vs. technologies that are compelling but not yet tied to a specific gap?

---

### Q2 — Additive manufacturing in the Canadian Defence supply chain: where is DRDC on this?

> *"DRDC is aware of additive manufacturing for defence — there are programs in the US (NSWC, NAVSEA) and UK (Dstl) doing serious AM work for naval maintenance. Where is Canada on this? Is DRDC actively running AM programs for naval spare parts, or is this still at the research interest/watching brief stage? And what would it take to get a Canadian AM capability — specifically Lloyd's Register-certified — recognized as a qualified source for RCN replacement components?"*

**Follow-up:** Has DRDC engaged with Atlantic XL (the LR-certified AM facility in St. John's) or Budd Group / NGen on AM for naval applications?

---

### Q3 — The IP and certification barrier: how do DND and DRDC think about OEM-authorized AM?

> *"When a navy vessel needs a replacement part for an OEM system — and the OEM either can't supply it in time or has discontinued it — what is the approved path to manufacturing that part through a non-OEM source? Does DND have a technical authority process for approving alternative manufactured parts? And how does OEM IP fit into that — can DND compel an OEM to share specs for a part critical to operational readiness, or does the OEM retain full control?"*

**Follow-up:** Is there a specific DND technical authority or design authority within DRDC Atlantic that manages approved alternative parts for naval systems?

---

### Q4 — Defence procurement and Canadian startup engagement: what actually works?

> *"AddManuChain is a Canadian startup looking to engage the Canadian Navy and DND. We've done interviews with Lee Vessey (Thales) and others in the naval supply chain. From DRDC's perspective — what is the realistic engagement path for a startup that has a relevant technology but isn't an established defence prime or integrator? Is it IDEaS? PSPC? A co-development agreement with DRDC directly? What has actually worked for maritime supply chain innovators trying to break into DND?"*

**Follow-up:** Is there a specific IDEaS challenge or DRDC solicitation currently open that a digital spare parts / AM platform would fit into?

---

### Q5 — The operational gap that doesn't have a solution yet: where is the pain?

> *"You work at the boundary between technology and operational need. In the maritime and naval maintenance space — vessel maintenance, deck equipment, propulsion, sensor systems — what is the operational gap that DRDC hears about repeatedly from the Navy that doesn't have a good solution yet? Not classified, just honestly: where is the unmet need that a Canadian technology company should be focused on right now?"*

**Follow-up:** Who within DRDC Atlantic or the RCN's materiel command should AddManuChain be speaking to directly about the spare parts availability problem?

---

## NETWORKING STRATEGY FOR THE EVENT

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| **4:00–4:30 (Networking)** | Open with Ultra Maritime on Q1 (lifecycle spare parts) — it's non-threatening and draws out real operational pain |
| **4:00–4:30 (Networking)** | Open with Hawboldt on Q1 (spare parts model) — they're an OEM, so lead with curiosity about their current model before the AM pitch |
| **Panel Q&A** | Lead with the Q for DRDC on AM in Canadian defence (Q2) — it's public-facing and shows you've done your homework |
| **Post-panel (4:30–6:00)** | Get 10 minutes with DRDC on Q4 (procurement path) and Q5 (operational gap) — this is the most valuable intelligence |
| **Card exchange priority** | Hawboldt Q5 follow-up (OEM-AM partnership model) is the most commercially actionable conversation — book a follow-up before leaving |
