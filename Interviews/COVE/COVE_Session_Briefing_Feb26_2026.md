# 🎙️ MISSION BRIEFING — COVE Ocean Connector
## Your Personal Podcast Script: Read This Out Loud. Walk In Ready.
**February 26, 2026 | 4:00–6:00 PM AST | Centre for Ocean Ventures and Entrepreneurship**

---

> **HOW TO USE THIS:** Read this out loud — alone in your car, on your walk over, in the elevator. Treat it like a podcast episode narrated to you. By the time you walk through those COVE doors you will know every person in that room, every angle of your pitch, and exactly what to say first. Everything below can be spoken aloud. Let's go.

## 🔷 PART ONE: WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE SELLING

*[Read this section as your warm-up. Know this cold before anything else.]*

You are Mahmoud Kiasari. You're in the Lab2Market Oceans Program at Dalhousie. Your company is **AddManuChain**, and here is your one-sentence pitch — say it out loud right now:

> *"AddManuChain is a digital platform that connects OEM blueprint owners, certified 3D print centres, and operators, so when a critical part fails at sea, you get a certified replacement in days instead of waiting months — without the OEM losing control of their IP."*

Say it again. Faster. Now slower. Good. That's your anchor.

Now here's the three-layer version for when someone asks "so what exactly do you do?":

**Layer 1 — The problem:** Every offshore vessel, navy ship, and remote industrial facility is sitting on $4–5 million dollars of physical spare parts inventory. Most of it will never be used. And the parts that actually break? They're the ones nobody stocked. You end up waiting 3–6 months for a custom component from an OEM overseas, while your vessel costs $50,000 to $100,000 per day sitting in port.

**Layer 2 — The solution:** AddManuChain converts that physical warehouse into a secure digital vault of certified CAD files. When a part is needed, the order goes through our platform — the OEM approves it digitally, a certified Lloyd's Register or DNV-approved facility near the vessel prints it, and you have a certified component in 3–5 days. The OEM's IP is protected by a cryptographic one-time print token. It streams the G-code to the printer, and when the job is done the token expires. Nobody walks away with the design file.

**Layer 3 — Why now, why Canada:** Atlantic XL in St. John's is the first Lloyd's Register-certified additive manufacturing facility in the Americas. That is our anchor partner. The National Shipbuilding Strategy is pumping billions into Canadian maritime manufacturing. And Canada's defence procurement community is finally taking domestic supply chain resilience seriously. We are at the right place at exactly the right time.

**Your numbers — memorize these:**
- Lead time reduction: 81% — from 21 days to 4 days average
- Warehouse cost reduction: 81% — from $450K to $85K per year for a mid-size operator
- Downtime prevented: $250K to $1M per day per vessel — that's what we prevent
- Atlantic XL certification: Lloyd's Register Type Approval for marine structural and critical components

## 🔷 PART TWO: THE EVENT — WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY YOU ARE THERE

*[This is your context layer. Read it once, it'll stick.]*

The event is called **Turning Breakthrough Concepts into Operational Capability**. That title is not an accident — it's a signal. Everyone in that room tonight is thinking about the same gap you're trying to cross: how does an innovative technology actually get deployed inside a large, risk-averse, procure-heavy maritime or defence organization?

That question is your in. AddManuChain lives exactly in that gap. You are a breakthrough concept trying to become operational capability. So does every conversation you have tonight.

Three invited speakers will be presenting or participating on a panel, then networking continues until 6. Here's how to think about the room:

- **Ultra Maritime** → defence electronics OEM, Royal Canadian Navy customer, Halifax presence
- **Hawboldt Industries** → Canadian marine mechanical OEM, RCN deck machinery supplier, based in Chester NS
- **DRDC Atlantic** → federal defence S&T agency, the people who decide what technologies the Navy actually adopts

Each of these is a different piece of the puzzle. Ultra Maritime and Hawboldt are potential **OEM partners** — companies whose IP you could digitize and whose customers you could serve. DRDC is your **pathway to defence deployment** — the technical authority that could certify AddManuChain as a qualified supply chain tool for the Royal Canadian Navy.

Tonight is not a pitch competition. Tonight is intelligence gathering and relationship initiation. Your job is to leave with three business cards, three concrete follow-up commitments, and one person who said some version of "yes, we should talk more about this."

## 🔷 PART THREE: ULTRA MARITIME — DEEP BRIEFING

*[Read this as if you're being debriefed by a colleague who knows them inside out.]*

**Who is Ultra Maritime?**

Ultra Maritime is a global defence electronics company. They build sonar systems, acoustic sensors, and underwater electronic systems. Their customers are NATO navies — including the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Navy in the UK, the Australian Navy. Their products go into submarines, surface warships, and unmanned underwater vehicles. Think of them as a tier-one supplier to the world's most demanding customers: naval procurement offices that won't accept a part unless it's been certified, qualified, tested, and documented six ways to Sunday.

They have a significant operational presence in Halifax. Halifax is a Navy town — HMC Dockyard is there, CFB Halifax is there, Irving Shipbuilding is there. Ultra Maritime is embedded in that ecosystem.

**Why do they matter for AddManuChain?**

Ultra Maritime's products go into vessels that operate for 20 to 30 years. Think about that. A sonar system installed on a Royal Canadian Navy frigate in 2005 is still operational today. The original production run for some of those components may have ended 10 years ago. The OEM's factory has moved on to newer products. But the navy still needs replacement parts for the hardware operating right now.

This is the core problem AddManuChain solves. And Ultra Maritime faces it from both sides: as an OEM whose older components are being demanded by navies, and as a technology embedded in vessels that need ongoing MRO support.

**The IP angle.** Ultra Maritime will be sensitive about IP. Defence electronics companies are among the most protective OEMs on the planet. Their designs are proprietary, export-controlled in many cases, and tied to government security classifications. You are not going in to ask them to share classified designs. You are going to talk about the *mechanical* and *structural* components — housings, brackets, enclosures, mounting systems — the non-electronic parts that hold their electronics in place. Those are the parts that fail from vibration, corrosion, and wear. Those are the parts that delay maintenance. And those are exactly the parts that can be printed by a Lloyd's-certified facility from an OEM-authorized file, with a DRM token ensuring the IP never leaves the secure pipeline.

**What to listen for from Ultra Maritime tonight:**

If they mention anything about: supply chain delays, obsolescence of older components, maintenance schedule overruns, parts availability at the end of a platform's life, frustration with the formal DND procurement channel for small components — **those are your signals.** That is the open door.

Also listen for Halifax connections. Ultra Maritime's Halifax presence means proximity to Irving Shipbuilding and the National Shipbuilding Strategy procurement ecosystem. A warm introduction from Ultra Maritime to Irving's supply chain team would be worth more than almost anything else you could walk out with tonight.

**Your opening line for Ultra Maritime:**

Walk up after the panel. Introduce yourself. Then say this:

> *"Your systems go into platforms that operate for 25 years. I'm curious — at what point in a platform's lifecycle does parts availability become the limiting factor rather than the technology itself? Is it year 10? Year 15?"*

Shut up and listen. Do not pitch. Just listen. If they engage — and they will — your follow-up is:

> *"That's exactly the problem we're working on. AddManuChain is a digital platform that lets an OEM authorize on-demand manufacturing of certified replacement components, using a cryptographic print pipeline that protects their IP completely. The print token streams to the certified facility, runs the job, and expires. The OEM gets a royalty, the operator gets the part in days, and the IP stays protected. We have Atlantic XL — the first Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility in the Americas — as our anchor partner. For a company like Ultra Maritime, this could mean extending the supportable life of your older platforms without maintaining legacy inventory."*

**Do not overstay.** Get their card. Say you'd love to follow up with someone on their supply chain or engineering team. Write down exactly what they said that was interesting before you walk to the next conversation.

## 🔷 PART FOUR: HAWBOLDT INDUSTRIES — DEEP BRIEFING

*[This one is special. Pay attention.]*

**Who is Hawboldt Industries?**

Hawboldt is a Canadian company. Based in Chester, Nova Scotia — that's on the south shore between Halifax and Lunenburg. They have been making marine deck machinery since the 1870s. Winches. Davits. Crane systems. Towing equipment. Hydraulic deck handling systems. Their equipment is on commercial fishing vessels, coast guard ships, offshore supply vessels, and Royal Canadian Navy warships.

Here is why Hawboldt is extraordinary for AddManuChain: they are the *perfect OEM case study*. Their equipment is:
- Custom-designed for each vessel
- Low-volume production (not thousands of units — dozens or fewer)
- High-complexity mechanical assemblies with lots of unique parts
- Long-service life (their winches operate for 20–40 years)
- Installed on vessels in remote locations — Newfoundland, the Pacific coast, Arctic waters

Every single one of those characteristics makes spare parts availability a nightmare. When a Hawboldt winch needs a replacement gear housing 15 years after installation, the original mould may be gone. The machinist who made it may have retired. The customer is potentially facing a multi-month lead time for a single custom component — and their vessel can't work without it.

**This is AddManuChain's ideal customer.** Not just as an operator — as an OEM partner.

**The OEM partnership framing.**

The most valuable conversation you can have with Hawboldt isn't about selling them access to other OEM's parts. It's about proposing that Hawboldt becomes an OEM on the AddManuChain platform. Here is what that would look like:

Hawboldt digitizes the engineering specs for their 20 most-requested replacement parts. They deposit those files into the AddManuChain encrypted vault — they never leave AddManuChain's DRM pipeline. When a verified Hawboldt customer needs one of those parts, they request it through AddManuChain, Hawboldt approves the print digitally, we issue a one-time token to the certified facility nearest the vessel, and the part is manufactured and shipped. Hawboldt gets a royalty on every print. The part is manufactured to Hawboldt spec by a certified facility. The customer gets their part in days instead of months. And Hawboldt's IP is completely protected.

That is a business model conversation, not a technology conversation. And Hawboldt is a Canadian company who would understand immediately why Lloyd's Register certification and Canadian manufacturing matters.

**What to listen for from Hawboldt:**

If they mention: longest wait times for custom parts, customers who call in frustration about discontinued components, the challenge of supporting 30-year-old equipment, DND maintenance contracts and whether the formal procurement path actually works — those are your openings.

Also listen for their relationship with the National Shipbuilding Strategy. Hawboldt is exactly the kind of established Canadian marine OEM that should be integrated into NSS supply chain planning. If they're frustrated that NSS is mostly about new builds and not about MRO and spare parts — that's a shared grievance AddManuChain can solve.

**Your opening line for Hawboldt:**

> *"You're making custom marine machinery that goes on vessels for 30 or 40 years. What does your spare parts model look like for equipment that's past its original production run? I'm asking because that's specifically the problem my company is built to solve."*

If they open up — and they likely will — your pitch pivot is:

> *"We have a model where OEMs like Hawboldt deposit their most-requested part specs into an encrypted digital vault. When a verified customer needs the part, you approve the print from your phone. A Lloyd's Register-certified facility — we have Atlantic XL as our anchor partner — manufactures it. The customer gets it in days. You get a royalty. And your IP has never left our DRM pipeline. It never touches an uncontrolled manufacturing environment."*

**The most commercially important question you can ask Hawboldt tonight:**

> *"Who at Hawboldt owns the spare parts and aftermarket relationship — is that engineering, sales, or operations? Because that's who I'd want to follow up with."*

Get that name. That is your follow-up contact. This is the most commercially actionable relationship in the room tonight.

## 🔷 PART FIVE: DRDC ATLANTIC — DEEP BRIEFING

*[This one is different. DRDC is not a customer. They are a gateway.]*

**Who is DRDC?**

Defence Research and Development Canada. They are a government agency — part of the Department of National Defence — whose entire mandate is bridging the gap between technology innovation and operational military capability. DRDC Atlantic is the Halifax-area arm, focused on maritime and naval systems.

Think of DRDC as the technology qualification authority for the Canadian Navy. If a new technology needs to be used on a Royal Canadian Navy vessel, DRDC is involved in deciding whether it's safe, effective, and appropriate. They run research programs. They do technology demonstrations. They issue technical authorities. They run procurement support programs. And critically — they connect Canadian startups with DND through programs like IDEaS (the Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security program).

**Why does DRDC matter to AddManuChain?**

The Canadian Navy is one of your best potential customers. But you can't just call the Navy and say "buy our platform." The path into defence procurement is long, structured, and gated by organizations like DRDC. The fastest legitimate path for a Canadian startup into DND is through a DRDC-supported program — either a co-development agreement, an IDEaS challenge response, or a supported technology demonstration on a vessel.

DRDC Atlantic has visibility into what the Navy actually needs. Not the official requirements documents — the real operational frustrations that commanders complain about informally. The parts that are always late. The maintenance delays that affect readiness. If you can find out from DRDC tonight what the *actual* operational gap is in naval spare parts, you can design your DRDC engagement strategy around solving a stated need rather than pitching a generic capability.

**The IDEaS program.** This is critical. IDEaS is DND's innovation procurement program and it's exactly the mechanism for a startup like AddManuChain to get an initial DND contract. Challenges are posted, companies respond, winners get funded for a proof of concept, then a demonstration, then (potentially) a procurement contract. If DRDC knows of a live IDEaS challenge that maps to digital spare parts or additive manufacturing for naval maintenance — that is your next step.

**What to listen for from DRDC during the panel:**

When DRDC talks about "turning breakthrough concepts into operational capability" — pay attention to any example they give where a technology took a long time to transition. That's probably a category where the path is hard. Also listen for any mention of: additive manufacturing, digital supply chains, maintenance readiness, parts obsolescence, Arctic operations, or domestic Canadian manufacturing. Any of those is an on-ramp to your follow-up question.

**Your question during the Q&A (if there's a panel):**

> *"From DRDC's perspective — where is the Royal Canadian Navy's additive manufacturing capability right now relative to allied navies like the US or UK? And what would it take for a Lloyd's Register-certified Canadian AM facility to be recognized as a qualified source for RCN replacement components?"*

That question signals you've done your homework. It's specific. It's publicly safe to answer. And it will tell you exactly where Canada sits on the AM spectrum, which either validates or accelerates your pitch.

**Your post-panel question for a one-on-one DRDC conversation:**

> *"We're a Canadian startup with a digital spare parts and AM platform. We have Lloyd's Register certification through our anchor partner. What is the realistic engagement pathway with DND for a company at our stage — is it IDEaS, a co-development agreement, or do we need to be further along commercially first?"*

That is the most useful question you can ask DRDC tonight. Their answer will give you a clear roadmap.

---

## 🔷 PART SIX: YOUR PITCH SEQUENCE — THE CONVERSATION ARCHITECTURE

*[This is your tactical playbook. Read it twice.]*

Every conversation tonight follows the same architecture:

**Step 1 — Open with curiosity, not pitch.** Ask them about their world. The opening questions are in your other briefing document. Do not start with "let me tell you about AddManuChain." Start with "I'm curious about your spare parts situation" or "how does your maintenance model actually work when a part isn't available?" Listen. Really listen. Take a mental note of the specific thing they say that's a pain point.

**Step 2 — Mirror the pain back.** When they describe a problem, mirror it back: "So the issue is that the formal DND procurement channel is too slow for components the Navy needs urgently, and you end up sourcing outside the contract?" Or: "So the challenge is that 15 years after installation, the original production run is over and you're manufacturing on-order which takes months?" When they say "exactly" — you've connected.

**Step 3 — Bridge to your solution with one sentence.** Not a pitch. A bridge. "That's the specific problem we're built to solve." Or: "We've heard that exact issue from every offshore operator we've interviewed — and our platform is designed around exactly that gap." Then wait. Let them ask "how?"

**Step 4 — Only then, pitch.** But pitch to the pain they just described. Not your generic pitch. The specific version that maps to their specific problem: for Ultra Maritime it's proprietary component lifecycle; for Hawboldt it's custom OEM spare parts; for DRDC it's domestic supply chain resilience and defence procurement pathway.

**Step 5 — Close for the follow-up, not the deal.** You're not closing a deal tonight. You're closing a meeting. "I'd love to have a 30-minute conversation with [name at their company] — could I get your email and follow up next week?" That's the win.

## 🔷 PART SEVEN: YOUR THREE PITCH VARIANTS

*[Read each one out loud once. You want these available in your mouth without thinking.]*

### Variant A — The 30-Second Elevator (Anyone who asks "what do you do?")

> *"I'm building AddManuChain — a platform that solves the spare parts lead time problem for offshore and naval operators. When a critical part fails at sea, you're waiting months for a custom OEM component. We've built a digital vault of certified CAD files, a cryptographic DRM pipeline that protects OEM IP, and a network of Lloyd's Register-certified AM facilities that can manufacture and deliver a certified part in days. Atlantic XL in St. John's is our anchor partner — first Lloyd's-certified AM facility in the Americas. We're focused on offshore oil and gas, maritime, and Canadian defence."*

### Variant B — The OEM Pitch (For Hawboldt and Ultra Maritime)

> *"Here's the value proposition for an OEM like yours. You have parts that customers need for equipment installed 10, 15, 20 years ago. Some of those designs are off the production floor — you manufacture on request, which means long lead times and high cost. We build you a digital spare parts program: your certified specs go into our encrypted vault, never leave our DRM pipeline. When a verified customer needs a part, you approve digitally, we issue a one-time cryptographic print token to a Lloyd's-certified facility, it manufactures to your spec, you earn a royalty. You extend the supportable life of every piece of equipment you've ever built, without maintaining physical inventory. Your IP is protected by design — not by contract."*

### Variant C — The Defence Pitch (For DRDC)

> *"AddManuChain is addressing sovereign supply chain resilience for Canadian defence and maritime. The Royal Canadian Navy is dependent on foreign OEMs and overseas production facilities for a significant category of maintenance components. When those supply chains are disrupted — geopolitical events, production discontinuation, COVID-type shocks — vessel readiness suffers. Our platform creates a domestic, secure digital inventory of certified CAD files, deployable through Lloyd's Register-certified Canadian AM facilities. We protect OEM IP through cryptographic DRM — specs never leave the authorized pipeline. The vision is a sovereign, certified, on-demand spare parts capability for the RCN, here in Canada. Atlantic XL is our first certified facility. We're looking to understand the DRDC engagement pathway that gets this demonstrated on a real platform."*

---

## 🔷 PART EIGHT: WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE TONIGHT

*[This is your definition of success. Read it now, remind yourself at 5:30.]*

You walk in at 4 PM. By 6 PM, this is what a successful night looks like:

✅ **One card from Hawboldt** with the name of the person who owns their aftermarket and spare parts business — engineering lead, sales director, or operations. You have a follow-up email scheduled in your head.

✅ **One card from Ultra Maritime** and a sentence from them that describes a real operational pain — something about parts availability at the end of a platform's life, or the challenge of IP protection with third-party manufacturing. That sentence becomes the opening line of your follow-up email tomorrow.

✅ **One email from DRDC** (program manager or research scientist) with either: the name of the relevant IDEaS challenge you should respond to, or a commitment to an intro call next week to discuss the procurement pathway.

✅ You gave your 30-second pitch at least four times — clean, confident, no hesitation.

✅ You asked at least one good question during the panel Q&A — the DRDC AM question from Part Five above.

✅ You did not spend the entire evening talking to one person. You moved. Three conversations minimum with speakers, two with fellow attendees (who might be operators, procurement officers, or other startups that could be partners or referrals).

**Bonus win:** Someone from Irving Shipbuilding's supply chain team is in the room. Ultra Maritime may be able to identify them. If you can get that introduction tonight, that's worth more than everything else combined.

---

## 🔷 PART NINE: HANDLING TOUGH QUESTIONS

*[Things they will ask. Your answers.]*

**"Are you actually printing parts today, or is this still conceptual?"**
> *"Atlantic XL, our anchor partner, is already operating as a Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility producing marine components. We are building the digital layer — the IP vault, the DRM pipeline, the approval workflow — on top of their existing production capability. Think of it as the software layer over a physical capability that already exists."*

**"What about liability? If a part printed through your platform fails, who's responsible?"**
> *"The part is manufactured to the OEM's certified spec, using the OEM's approved materials and process, at a Lloyd's Register-certified facility. The OEM has approved the print — they've issued that authorization digitally. The liability chain is: OEM approved the design, classification society certified the facility and process, AddManuChain provided the secure workflow. That's the same liability chain as traditional OEM-licensed manufacturing. We're not creating liability — we're making the existing chain digital and traceable."*

**"Why hasn't this been done before?"**
> *"Two things have to be true simultaneously — you need a certified AM facility that's been approved by a marine classification society, and you need a secure digital pipeline that makes an OEM comfortable sharing their specs. The AM certification piece only happened. Atlantic XL got Lloyd's Register approval recently. We're the first to build the platform layer on top of it in the Canadian market."*

**"How do you make money?"**
> *"Transaction fee on every print job — typically 10–15% of the manufacturing cost. We also have platform subscription fees for OEMs who maintain a digital parts library. And we take a royalty split for the OEM — they earn 90% of the royalty component, we take 10%. The model is designed so that the OEM sees AddManuChain as revenue-generating, not a cost."*

**"Aren't you competing with the OEMs? Don't they want to manufacture the parts themselves?"**
> *"We're competing with waiting 6 months and getting nothing. For parts an OEM no longer actively manufactures — obsolete components, low-volume legacy parts — there's no active manufacturing happening. We give OEMs a passive revenue stream on parts they've essentially abandoned. For newer, high-volume parts, OEMs can choose not to participate. The platform is opt-in for OEMs. We start with the parts they're already struggling to support."*

---

## 🔷 PART TEN: YOUR FINAL 60-SECOND READ — SAY THIS OUT LOUD RIGHT NOW

*[Do this in the car, in the elevator, or outside the door. It's your warm-up.]*

My name is Mahmoud Kiasari. I am building AddManuChain — a platform that replaces physical spare parts warehouses with secure digital files, delivered through certified additive manufacturing, so operators get critical parts in days instead of months.

Tonight I am meeting Ultra Maritime — a global naval defence OEM who needs a way to support long-lifecycle products without maintaining legacy inventory. I am going to ask them about parts availability for platforms in their 15th and 20th year of service.

Tonight I am meeting Hawboldt Industries — a Canadian marine OEM whose custom deck machinery is on RCN and commercial vessels for 30 or 40 years. I am going to ask them who owns their spare parts and aftermarket business, and I am going to propose an OEM partnership model before I leave.

Tonight I am meeting DRDC Atlantic — the federal defence S&T agency that decides which technologies make it onto Royal Canadian Navy vessels. I am going to ask them about the AM capability gap in Canadian naval maintenance, and I am going to ask for the realistic procurement pathway into DND.

I know my pitch. I know their pain. I know exactly what I want to walk out with.

Three cards. Three follow-up commitments. One conversation that starts with "yes, let's talk more."

Let's go.
