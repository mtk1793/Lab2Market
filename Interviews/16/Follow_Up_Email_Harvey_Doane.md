**Subject:** Following Up: Mission Assurance Platform for Space Operations

Hi Harvey,

Thank you for the incredibly insightful conversation about AM adoption in the space sector. Your advice to **"sell what they're buying, not what you're selling"** was a masterclass that fundamentally changed my entire go-to-market approach.

## The Lightbulb Moment

When you said:

> "If it's a critical clamp, they're not buying a clamp. They're buying safety of their mission, time, reliability, faith of their clients."

...that completely reframed my value proposition. I've been pitching **"faster parts"** when I should be pitching **"mission assurance."**

## Key Takeaways I'm Acting On

**1. Customer Segmentation Refinement**

Your guidance that my platform is **"more pertinent to satellite/rocket manufacturers, not launch facilities"** was a crucial correction. I was targeting the wrong customer segment. I'm now focusing on:

- ✅ Satellite constellation manufacturers (building 50-200+ satellites)
- ✅ New space rocket companies (AM-first mindset)
- ❌ Launch service providers (too low volume, you were right)

**2. Criticality Framework**

Your breakdown of low/medium/high criticality parts and their different adoption speeds is now my sales strategy:

- **Phase 1:** Low-criticality parts (brackets, covers, cable management)
- **Phase 2:** Medium-criticality (thermal, structural components)
- **Phase 3:** High-criticality (engines, pressure vessels—years away)

This staged approach makes way more sense than trying to sell everything at once.

**3. US Navy Temporary Solutions Model**

The example of the **Navy wanting "5-6 3D printers on board"** with the philosophy that **"it doesn't have to last forever—just get us back to port"** is a powerful framing I'm now using:

- **Space equivalent:** "Print the part → Make the launch window → Mission success"
- **Oil & Gas:** "Print the valve → Resume production → Replace at next maintenance"
- **Acceptable risk:** Temporary solution beats mission failure

**4. Proof Over Persuasion**

Your advice to **"don't just listen to me, but let me demonstrate"** is now my approach:

- Free pilot: Provide 10-50 test parts to constellation manufacturer
- Customer tests in real conditions
- Data decides (not sales pitch)
- Case study from early adopter → Credibility for next customer

## Old Space vs. New Space Strategy

Your distinction between:
- **Old Space** (Boeing, Lockheed): Traditional, slow to adopt → Target later
- **New Space** (SpaceX, Relativity): AM-first, rapid innovation → Target first

...is brilliant. Prove with new space innovators, then use those case studies to crack old space primes.

## AI Differentiation

Your point that the platform should offer **"not just replacing a piece, but continuous improvement"** is exactly the differentiation I need:

❌ **Commodity supplier:** "Here's your part"  
✅ **Strategic platform:** "Here's your part + why it failed + improved v2.0 that's 10% lighter and 15% stronger"

This transforms the platform from transactional vendor to strategic partner.

## Applying Your Insights

**Value Proposition Reframe:**

**OLD:** "We offer 3D printing services for space components"

**NEW:** "We ensure your $50M-$300M satellites make their orbital windows by eliminating part shortages through AI-predicted inventory and on-demand additive manufacturing"

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Predictive Intelligence** (AI analyzes telemetry, predicts failures 3-6 months ahead)
2. **On-Demand Manufacturing** (digital inventory, print when needed)
3. **Continuous Improvement** (failure analysis → design optimization → next-gen parts)

## Thank You

This conversation provided more strategic clarity than the previous 10 interviews combined. The shift from technology-first to outcome-first positioning is exactly what I needed, and it came from your decades of business development experience.

Your offer to explore your Space Innovation Canada and CDL networks means a great deal. When I have proof-of-concept results from initial customers (targeting late 2026), I'll reach out to share those results and discuss potential introductions at that stage.
