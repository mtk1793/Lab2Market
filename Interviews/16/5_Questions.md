# Interview 16 - Harvey Doane (Maritime Launch Services)
## 5 QUESTIONS ONLY

**1. SPACE INDUSTRY SPARE PARTS CHALLENGES:**
"What are the biggest inventory and spare parts challenges for launch operations at Maritime Launch? Where do current solutions fall short—lead times for critical components, managing ground support equipment, or finding parts for legacy systems?"

**2. DIGITAL INVENTORY FIT FOR SPACE:**
"How do you see digital inventory fitting into space launch operations? Is it more relevant for ground support equipment, or could it extend to launch vehicle components? What makes space different from other industries when it comes to spare parts?"

**3. CERTIFICATION FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS:**
"What's involved in certifying AM parts for space industry ground support? Who manages that process, and what standards do you follow? Would streamlined digital certification tools make AM more attractive for launch operations?"

**4. OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES:**
"When a launch is delayed or faces a parts issue, what matters most—getting the part faster, ensuring absolute reliability, or managing costs? How do those priorities differ between ground support and flight-critical components?"

**5. ECOSYSTEM PLATFORM FOR SPACE INDUSTRY:**
"For a digital platform that connects launch operators, AM suppliers, and certification bodies—what would make that valuable to Maritime Launch? What concerns would you have about adopting such a platform in a high-stakes environment like space launches?"
