# Interview Questions - Harvey Doane (Maritime Launch Services)

**Name:** Harvey Doane  
**Title:** Vice President (Former)  
**Company:** Maritime Launch Services (MLS)  
**Industry:** Space Launch Services  
**Meeting Date:** February 4, 2026, 1:30pm  
**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Space Industry Digital Inventory Validation)

**Context:** Maritime Launch Services is developing Canada's first commercial spaceport in Nova Scotia. Space launch operations face extreme supply chain challenges (remote location, specialized parts, zero downtime tolerance).

## QUESTION 1: Space Launch Parts Inventory (Specialized + Urgent)

**Background:** Space industry likely faces similar challenges to offshore oil & gas: remote operations, specialized parts, high downtime costs. But adds extreme quality requirements.

**Question:**

> "Space launch operations seem to combine the worst supply chain challenges I've been hearing about:
> - **Remote location** (Nova Scotia spaceport, far from aerospace suppliers)
> - **Specialized parts** (rocket components aren't off-the-shelf)
> - **Zero-downtime tolerance** (launch windows can't slip without massive cost)
> - **Extreme quality requirements** (failures = catastrophic)
>
> How does Maritime Launch Services approach spare parts inventory for launch operations? Do you:
> - Pre-stock everything physically at the spaceport?
> - Rely on just-in-time delivery from suppliers?
> - Maintain digital inventory (CAD files) for AM-on-demand?
>
> And when critical parts fail or are damaged close to a launch window, what's your backup plan?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Pain point exploration:** Space likely has WORSE version of offshore problem
- **Digital inventory validation:** Are they already thinking about this?
- **Extreme use case:** If platform works for space, works for anything

**What You're Testing:**
- **Market validation:** Does space need digital inventory even more than oil & gas?
- **Adoption readiness:** Already using AM, or still traditional?
- **Business case:** Downtime cost in space = platform ROI proof

## QUESTION 2: AM for Space Applications (Certification Hell?)

**Background:** Dr. Nasiri said oil & gas certification is "costly and time demanding." Space certification must be exponentially worse (NASA standards, flight-critical parts).

**Question:**

> "I'm researching additive manufacturing adoption across industries, and I keep hearing that certification is the biggest barrier—oil & gas operators won't use AM parts because certifying each one is too expensive and time-consuming.
>
> How does the space industry approach AM certification? Is it:
> - Even stricter than oil & gas (SpaceX/NASA-level requirements)?
> - More standardized because aerospace already uses AM extensively?
> - Or are non-flight-critical parts (ground support equipment) easier to certify?
>
> And does Maritime Launch see a role for AM in launch operations, either for rocket components or ground infrastructure?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Certification comparison:** Space vs oil & gas (which is harder?)
- **Opportunity identification:** Non-flight-critical parts = entry point?
- **AM readiness:** Are they exploring it, or is it too risky for space?

**What You're Testing:**
- **Certification pathway:** Can oil & gas learn from aerospace standards?
- **Part segmentation:** Flight-critical (hard) vs ground support (easier)?
- **Platform applicability:** Does platform work for space, or too specialized?

## QUESTION 3: Digital Inventory for Ground Support Equipment

**Background:** Rockets are flight-critical (hard to AM), but ground support equipment (fueling systems, launch pads, transport vehicles) might be easier.

**Question:**

> "Even if rocket components themselves are too critical for AM in the near term, what about ground support equipment—things like:
> - Fueling system components
> - Launch pad infrastructure parts
> - Transport and handling equipment
> - Facility maintenance items
>
> For a remote spaceport in Nova Scotia, does it make sense to maintain digital inventory of these ground support parts and print them on-demand rather than stockpiling physical spares?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Non-critical entry point:** Ground support = lower risk (validates Nasiri framework)
- **Remote location advantage:** Nova Scotia = perfect use case for digital inventory
- **Platform validation:** If space says "yes," oil & gas definitely needs it

**What You're Testing:**
- **Entry pathway:** Can space adopt AM for non-critical first, then graduate?
- **Remote need:** Does geographic isolation drive interest?
- **Platform features:** What would space need (different from oil & gas)?

## QUESTION 4: Cross-Industry Lessons (Space → Oil & Gas)

**Background:** Space and offshore oil & gas have surprising overlap: remote ops, harsh environments, specialized parts, high consequence of failure.

**Question:**

> "Space and offshore oil & gas seem to face remarkably similar supply chain challenges—remote operations, harsh environments, specialized parts, and catastrophic downtime costs.
>
> Are there lessons from the space industry's approach to parts inventory and rapid fabrication that offshore operators should adopt? Or vice versa—are there things oil & gas does well that space could learn from?
>
> And have you seen any cross-pollination between industries on digital inventory or AM adoption?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Thought leadership:** Positions you as connecting industries (valuable insight)
- **Lesson extraction:** What works in space that oil & gas hasn't tried?
- **Cross-sell opportunity:** Platform for space AND oil & gas?

**What You're Testing:**
- **Best practices:** What can each industry learn from the other?
- **Platform scalability:** One platform for multiple extreme-environment industries?
- **Network effects:** Space + oil & gas together = bigger market

## FOLLOW-UP OPPORTUNITIES:

**If Harvey mentions AM is too risky for flight-critical:**
> "Totally understandable. But for ground support equipment, what would need to be true for Maritime Launch to adopt AM—pre-certification? Cost threshold? Local AM facility partnership?"

**If Harvey mentions inventory is a major pain point:**
> "Would a digital parts library with pre-certified ground support equipment designs be valuable? You could 'click to print' at a local facility rather than waiting weeks for shipments from aerospace suppliers."

**If Harvey mentions launch delays due to part failures:**
> "How much does a 1-week launch delay cost Maritime Launch? I'm trying to quantify the business case for digital inventory that could avoid those delays."

**If Harvey is enthusiastic about cross-industry lessons:**
> "Who in the oil & gas sector should I talk to who might be receptive to space industry best practices? Or vice versa—are there space industry contacts who'd benefit from offshore learnings?"

**At the end:**
> "Maritime Launch is pioneering commercial space in Canada. As I develop this digital inventory platform, would you be open to staying connected? Space could be a perfect testbed for extreme-environment AM adoption."

## KEY INSIGHTS TO LISTEN FOR:

✅ **Inventory strategy:** Physical stockpile vs just-in-time vs digital library  
✅ **Certification requirements:** Space vs oil & gas (stricter? standardized?)  
✅ **AM adoption:** Already using? Exploring? Too risky?  
✅ **Ground support opportunity:** Non-critical parts = entry point for space?  
✅ **Remote location impact:** Does Nova Scotia isolation drive digital inventory need?  
✅ **Downtime cost:** Quantify launch delay cost (business case data)  
✅ **Cross-industry connections:** Who in oil & gas / space should I talk to?

**Strategic Goal for This Interview:**

1. **Validate extreme-environment use case** (space = ultimate test for digital inventory)
2. **Identify entry pathway** (ground support equipment, non-flight-critical)
3. **Quantify downtime cost** (launch delays = business case proof)
4. **Explore cross-industry platform** (space + oil & gas + offshore = larger market)
5. **Get introductions** (aerospace suppliers, other space operators, oil & gas contacts)
