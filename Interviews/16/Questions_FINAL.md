# Interview 16 - Harvey Doane (Maritime Launch Services)
## FINAL 4-5 QUESTIONS (Carol-Focused)

**Meeting:** February 4, 2026, [TIME]  
**Time Limit:** 30 minutes = 4-5 questions MAX

---

## Q1: Current Problem & Cost - Space Industry (CRITICAL)

> "For Maritime Launch Services and the space industry, what's the biggest inventory/spare parts challenge?
>
> Specifically, **how much does it cost** when:
> - A launch is delayed because a specialized part isn't available?
> - You're maintaining physical inventory for ground support equipment?
> - You're managing parts for low-volume, high-criticality systems?
>
> I need **specific $$$ data**: cost per day of delay, inventory carrying costs, procurement lead times?"

**Listen for:** Quantified costs, delay impacts, space industry specifics

---

## Q2: Who Pays in Space Industry? (CRITICAL)

> "For space companies, who has budget authority for spare parts / inventory optimization solutions?
>
> - Launch operations budget?
> - Engineering/R&D budget?
> - Is it Maritime Launch directly, or your customers (satellite companies)?
>
> **What ROI threshold** approves this type of investment? And **is the end user the same as the buyer?**"

**Listen for:** Buyer persona, budget source, decision-making unit

---

## Q3: AM Certification in Aerospace (Barrier Validation)

> "Aerospace has solved AM certification (Tronosjet, Relativity Space printing rocket engines).
>
> For ground support equipment at Maritime Launch:
> - **How much does it cost** to certify an AM part for space industry use?
> - **How long does it take?** (weeks, months, years?)
> - **Who pays?** (you, suppliers, or customers?)
> - **Can certification be reused** across multiple launches/customers, or is it part-specific?"

**Listen for:** Certification economics, reusability, pathway templates

---

## Q4: Faster, Cheaper, or Better for Space? (Competitive Advantage)

> "If you could change ONE thing about Maritime Launch's spare parts/inventory system:
> - Make it **faster** (reduce lead times)?
> - Make it **cheaper** (lower inventory/procurement costs)?
> - Make it **better** (higher reliability for critical launches)?
>
> Which matters MOST to your operations? And **how much would you pay** to solve it?"

**Listen for:** Priority problem, competitive positioning, willingness to pay

---

## Q5: Digital Inventory for Ground Support (Market Validation - IF TIME)

> "For ground support equipment (not the launch vehicle itself), does digital inventory + AM-on-demand make sense?
>
> Or is the space industry different because:
> - Parts are too critical (can't risk AM)?
> - Volumes are too low (not worth cataloging)?
> - Certification too expensive (kills business case)?
>
> What would make digital inventory work for space ground operations?"

**Listen for:** Space industry adoption barriers, market fit, unique constraints

---

## CRITICAL FOLLOW-UPS (Dig Deeper):

**If vague:** "Can you quantify that? $X per launch? Y hours of delay?"

**If "depends on mission":** "What's the range? Commercial vs defense? LEO vs GEO?"

**If mentions certification:** "What's the cost breakdown? Testing? Documentation? Regulator fees?"

**End:** "Who else in space industry (Blue Origin, SpaceX ground ops, Rocket Lab) should I talk to?"

---

## SUCCESS = Leave with:
✅ **Launch delay cost** ($$$ per day)  
✅ **Certification cost/time** for space AM parts  
✅ **Buyer persona** (who approves innovation spending)  
✅ **Competitive advantage** (speed/cost/reliability priority)  
✅ **Space industry referrals** (ground ops contacts)
