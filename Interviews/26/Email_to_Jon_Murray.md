**Subject: AddManuChain - Digital Spare Parts Ecosystem for O&G (Follow-up from John Whelan)**

---

Dear Jon,

Thank you for your response and John Whelan's referral. As requested, here's a brief overview of my research and what I'd like to discuss with Imperial.

## 🔗 Core Concept: Digital Parts Ecosystem

I'm researching **AddManuChain** - a platform that connects the fragmented spare parts ecosystem for O&G operations:

**Traditional Pain Point:**
- Operators (like Imperial) → wait months → OEMs → manufacture → ship → certify
- Each entity operates in isolation with information silos

**Our Ecosystem Approach:**
- **Operators** identify part needs through predictive maintenance
- **Digital Library** provides pre-certified designs (DNV/ABS/Lloyd's approved)
- **Local AM Facilities** produce parts on-demand
- **Certification Bodies** validate once, use many times
- **ERP Systems (SAP)** orchestrate the entire flow

Think: **Amazon marketplace model** but for industrial parts with built-in safety compliance.

## 🎯 Why Imperial's Perspective Matters

Through 23 interviews (maritime, defense, mining, O&G), I've validated:
- **6-month lead times** for specialized valves (OMV Austria)
- **15% ROI threshold** required for O&G technology adoption
- **Certification is the #1 barrier** (7 interviews confirmed)

**Critical Gap:** No one has successfully connected all ecosystem players - operators remain isolated from certification bodies, AM facilities, and digital solutions.

Imperial, as a Tier 1 operator with Canada-wide supply chain, can provide unique insights on:
1. **What prevents ecosystem collaboration today?** (IP concerns? Trust? Standards?)
2. **What would make Imperial comfortable sharing part requirements with certified AM facilities?**
3. **How can we reduce certification friction between operators and Class Societies?**

## 🤝 Ecosystem Benefits for Imperial

**Short-term:**
- Access pre-certified parts library (reduce approval time from months → days)
- Connect to nearby certified AM facilities (reduce shipping delays)

**Long-term:**
- Become anchor tenant in Canadian O&G spare parts ecosystem
- Influence certification standards for digital inventory
- Reduce inventory footprint through distributed manufacturing network

## 📋 What I'd Like to Discuss (20-30 minutes)

**Key Questions:**
1. What's Imperial's biggest barrier to adopting non-OEM parts? (IP? Certification? Quality?)
2. How much does Imperial spend annually on inventory holding costs across Canada?
3. Would Imperial participate in a multi-company ecosystem if certification barriers were solved?
4. What ROI would justify a pilot with non-critical parts at one Canadian site?

**Goal:** Understand whether Tier 1 O&G companies see value in an ecosystem approach vs traditional isolated supply chains.

## ⏭️ Next Steps

Based on your availability:

**Option 1:** 20-30 minute call with you to understand supply chain perspective

**Option 2:** Introduction to the most relevant lead at Imperial (procurement, safety certification, or asset management)

I'm flexible to your schedule and happy to work around your travel commitments.
