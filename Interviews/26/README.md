## 🌟 Why This Interview is CRITICAL

This is our **HIGHEST PRIORITY INTERVIEW** for several reasons:

### 1. **CEO Referral**
- John Whelan (President & CEO) personally forwarded the inquiry
- Signals genuine high-level interest, not just courtesy
- Direct access to decision-maker

### 2. **Tier 1 O&G Validation**
- Imperial Oil is Canada's largest petroleum company
- If Imperial is interested → Tier 1 companies are viable market
- If Imperial passes → Pivot to Tier 2/3 operators

### 3. **Massive Scale**
- Canada-wide supply chain oversight
- Largest inventory numbers we'll see (likely $100M+ in spare parts)
- Multiple SAGD sites + refineries = huge ROI potential

### 4. **Critical Hypothesis Test**
**H71: Big Companies = Deep Pockets = No Urgency**
- Assembly Studio said "Tier 1 dinosaurs won't move"
- Jon's proactive response suggests otherwise
- **This interview determines our target market**
