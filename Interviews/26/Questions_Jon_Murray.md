## 🎯 Three Key Needs to Address

### 1. **Supply Chain Cost Optimization**
**Pain Point:** Massive inventory holding costs across Canadian operations (warehouses, insurance, obsolescence)  
**Our Solution:** AI-driven stock-vs-print decision engine integrated with SAP to reduce physical inventory 30%

### 2. **Lead Time Reduction for Critical Parts**
**Pain Point:** 6-month lead times for specialized components causing production delays  
**Our Solution:** Pre-certified digital parts library enabling local AM production in days, not months

### 3. **Certification Compliance Automation**
**Pain Point:** Manual tracking of safety certifications creates delays and audit risk  
**Our Solution:** Automated certification verification integrated with SAP Safety Management module

---

### Q2: Downtime Cost Quantification 💸
**"What's the average cost per day when a Canadian operation is waiting on a safety-certified part that's available physically but stuck in certification approval?"**

**Why this question:**
- Separates **physical delay vs paperwork delay** (critical distinction)
- Gets dollar figure for certification bottleneck
- Validates CP.3: Certification Proof Difficulty hypothesis

**Expected insights:**
- Downtime cost: $___K per day per facility
- Frequency of certification-related delays: ___ times/year
- Ratio: physical parts delays vs certification delays

**Follow-up probes:**
- Which specific part categories cause the most certification delays?
- How often does Imperial use "temporary" uncertified parts as stopgaps?
- What's the approval process for emergency substitutions?

---

### Q3: Non-OEM Part Approval Process 🔐

**Why this question:**
- Identifies **certification barriers** we need to solve
- Gets timeline (weeks? months? years?)
- Reveals decision-makers and approval hierarchy

**Expected insights:**
- Approval timeline: ___ weeks/months
- Certification bodies: API, ASME, CSA, provincial regulators?
- Internal approval chain: engineering → safety → procurement?

**Follow-up probes:**
- Has Imperial ever approved a 3D printed part? What was the process?
- What documentation would a "pre-certified parts library" need to include?
- Who has final sign-off authority for non-OEM parts?

---

### Q4: ROI Threshold for Technology Pilots 📊
**"When evaluating a new supply chain technology, what minimum ROI percentage and payback period does Imperial require before approving a pilot project?"**

**Why this question:**
- Tests **NH.19: 15% ROI Threshold** hypothesis
- Gets exact decision criteria (15%? 20%? 25%?)
- Reveals whether safety compliance can reduce ROI requirement

**Expected insights:**
- Minimum ROI: ___%
- Maximum payback period: ___ years
- Difference between safety-focused vs cost-focused projects

**Follow-up probes:**
- Would a safety/compliance improvement justify a lower ROI threshold?
- How does Imperial measure "risk reduction" in business cases?
- What's the largest supply chain technology investment Imperial has made recently, and what ROI justified it?

---

### Q5: ERP Integration Requirements 🔗
**"What SAP modules does Imperial use for asset management and procurement, and what would be the biggest challenge in integrating an external digital inventory system?"**

**Why this question:**
- Tests **KR.1: IoT/AI Quality System Integration**
- Gets specific SAP architecture (MM, PM, QM modules)
- Identifies technical barriers to deployment

**Expected insights:**
- SAP modules in use: SAP S/4HANA? SAP PM? SAP QM?
- Integration preference: API (OData/RFC) vs manual upload
- On-premise vs cloud requirements (IP protection)

**Follow-up probes:**
- How does Imperial currently track part certifications in SAP?
- Does Imperial use predictive maintenance systems that could trigger parts orders?
- What's the biggest integration challenge with external vendors?

### Q6: Hidden Costs of Physical Inventory 💼
**"Beyond the obvious warehouse and insurance costs, what are the biggest 'hidden costs' of maintaining large physical inventories across Imperial's Canadian operations?"**

**Why this question:**
- Uncovers **non-obvious costs** (obsolescence, expiry, labor, opportunity cost)
- Gets qualitative insights beyond spreadsheet numbers
- Reveals pain points we might not have considered

**Expected insights:**
- Obsolescence rates: ___% per year
- Parts expiry before use: ___% 
- Labor for inventory management: ___ FTEs
- Space opportunity cost: what else could warehouses be used for?

**Follow-up probes:**
- How often do safety certifications expire before parts are needed?
- What happens to obsolete inventory? (write-off? donate? scrap?)
- How much does Imperial spend on inventory audits and reconciliation?

---

### Q7: Pilot Opportunity & Next Steps 🚀
**"If we could demonstrate 15%+ ROI through a pilot program with non-critical parts at one Canadian site, what would Imperial need to see to expand the program?"**

**Why this question:**
- Moves from **discovery to action** (commercial opportunity)
- Gets specific success criteria for pilot
- Tests willingness to adopt (early adopter vs fast follower)

**Expected insights:**
- Willingness to pilot: yes/no
- Preferred pilot site: SAGD vs conventional?
- Success metrics: cost savings? downtime reduction? safety compliance?

**Follow-up probes:**
- Which Canadian site would be most suitable for a pilot?
- What part categories would be best for proof of concept? (non-critical, high-volume, etc.)
- Would NGen funding (government co-investment) make a pilot more attractive?
- Who at Imperial would need to approve a pilot project?
