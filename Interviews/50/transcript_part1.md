Speaker 1  (00:02)
Hello? 

Speaker 2  (00:04)
Hey, how are you? And how are you planning? Thank you very much. 

Speaker 2  (00:08)
Really appreciate it for being here today. I mean, I know your schedule's super busy. These days, but really thank you very much. 

Speaker 2  (00:29)
I'm so sorry, something happened. I just closed it across the window. Yeah, okay? 

Speaker 2  (00:34)
First of all, let me introduce myself a little bit. My name is mahu kiasri. I am doing my PhD at dalhouse university, Canada right now. 

Speaker 2  (00:42)
And around 2 years ago, we were working with a company that they had an idea related to building an ecosystem between different entities and additive manufacturing at the end, resulted approved by a program named lab to market. And this program, there are going to help us as a new entrepreneurs in order to talk with different experts like you in order to see that, can our idea become acceptable for market or not throughout this program. I have to talk with so many people, at least 100 to some kind of get their ideas at what's going on. 

Speaker 2  (01:16)
And I was talking with Mr. Gwanim and such a nice guy, and he saw kind of told me about you, and II like to see that my some kind of pitch or idea is going to be work in aerospace, or not. That was a little bit about me. 

Speaker 2  (01:29)
And from your side that you can testicate it 

Speaker 1  (01:36)
Let's proceed in that case. I will have to jump off unfortunately, in about 15 minutes for simple reason. I had something that kind of popped out last minute with another candidate for trying to hire, but what I can do after we're done with the call, we can reschedule another call, where I'll have a little bit more time, but at least I did not want to change or cancel the call last minute. 

Speaker 1  (02:03)
So just wanted to give it a heads up. But. Yes. 

Speaker 2  (02:05)
Vendors, okay. For sure. So the procedure is like this. 

Speaker 2  (02:09)
I mean, right now, because I prepared a couple of questions, but right now, since we only have 15 minutes, just a little bit about your side, then I'm going to ask a very general question. But just, you know what, it's a little bit about your side, then I would talk about my pitch, and we can talk about the questions in another call. Would that be okay? 

Speaker 1  (02:29)
With the opposite, go ahead with your end. So what you're doing and how it can help you basically so that will be perfect. 

Speaker 2  (02:37)
So the idea is like this, because it was something like that I would ask the question at the end, I would talk about my ph. But let's talk about it right now. The idea is building ecosystem between different entities or segments. 

Speaker 2  (02:48)
Like end user, the oems, authoritarian, and some kind of regulation bodies, and after that, the 3D printing facilities. So we would like to encourage different industries to focus on digital inventory related than physical inventory. Obviously, when we are talking about that, we are talking about additive, manufacturing and 3D printing, another idea. 

Speaker 2  (03:08)
That's some kind of our mind was that how we can use the technology in the whole process over here. So right now, we're still working on the technology and AI side. It's beside that oneI still haven't decided about that, but the total idea is that we would like to talk with industries and tell them that. 

Speaker 2  (03:26)
Okay, install these 3D printing on your site. And instead of just focusing too much on the physical inventory, try to reduce down it to part of it to be digital inventory. And then try to produce the parts, not the very big ones right now are the small ones. 

Speaker 2  (03:42)
The metal parts right now. Y because we know breaking down these small components, maybe it works around a $100. It's going to stop the whole million dollars industry by encouraging them to do that. 

Speaker 2  (03:55)
Obviously it has a lot of challenges. We have to talk with regulations. We have to talk with so many things but still working on it. 

Speaker 2  (04:02)
We are going to help industries to reduce the downtime costs and save so much money. We talk with the Lloyd registration. I mean, they're working in some kind of in oil and gas industries. 

Speaker 2  (04:14)
And they somehow like the idea, but they told us that you have to work on a little bit more on it. 

Speaker 1  (04:20)
Let me try to repeat or try to extrapolate what I understand from what you do. Yes, please basically you're trying to Uh ugh use a smart way to do inventory management or most importantly to do to be able to match production needs with production capabilities based on the production availability of each machine that will be in a database that will put in place and the basically the materials being used and the capabilities of the machines are basically if I'm producing one part where the part there's a big a******. 

Speaker 1  (05:02)
That's empty. You will be able to insert one of your parts there. So I printed at the same time, it will increase my print time by say maybe 5%, 10%, but it will help me generate more revenue, so your goal is to be able to use. 

Speaker 1  (05:17)
Had be it industry forefront, all methods or artificial intelligence to optimize that abhijinae. 

Speaker 2  (05:26)
I can see most of it were right about the technology side. We haven't decided yet because the very beginning part was encouraging industries to use the 3D printing. Because it's very common these days. 

Speaker 2  (05:39)
We would like to help them to have that one. And provide a platform because everything is happening throughout the platform. We are not some kind of advertising 3D printers. 

Speaker 2  (05:48)
We are not doing that. We are platform that industries can use us to be connected with the oems with other parts to make sure that they do have the product on time on-site. This is something we are doing at. 

Speaker 2  (06:01)
Yes, a technology would be for the next phase. Exactly. 

Speaker 1  (06:04)
Interesting, okay, perfect. And how can I help you? 

Speaker 2  (06:07)
The thing is, that right now, the main question that I have is I talk with different industries with the oil and gas, with some kind of aerospace. Recently, I talk with gkn aerospace, and they're in UK, and I try to some kind of put my niche in that area as well to see that, how is going to be available? So I would like to know from your site. 

Speaker 2  (06:30)
That is additive manufacturing. I mean, factor I mean, forget about my idea. The additive manufacturing, how advanced is it in aerospace right now? 

Speaker 2  (06:42)
Because when I was talking with those guys, they were commercial airplane, some kind of company they told me that we don't trust edited Minecraft in practical right now. So yeah 

Speaker 1  (06:52)
For space and rockets. There's an article in space are two different things. When it comes to certification and life cycle, an airplane has to live 40 years. 

Speaker 1  (07:08)
A rocket has to live 4 minutes. An airplane will be carrying people. A rocket is carrying satellites or trash. 

Speaker 1  (07:15)
Whatever the hell you're carrying, we have a tendency to be a little bit more We explore a little bit more because if I can reduce what we do is complex if I can reduce complexity by removing interfacing and such by combining parts together or by facilitating production. Sure, no problem. And we have been, you know, everyone that builds rockets that know, again at least that have built a bit of expertise, you learn how to not trust anything. 

Speaker 1  (07:45)
But your test and your data. So we buy valves from suppliers. They tell us the valve is rated to a 1000 psi. 

Speaker 1  (07:52)
We say, okay, thank you. F*** off. And we rated ourselves to 3000 psi, or 2000 psi, and I can cite examples like this. 

Speaker 1  (08:00)
A lot about a lot of things, same thing with addiction manufacturing, we use additive manufacturing, very extensively, very, very extensively for rockets. It is very common because if you're producing one rocket every two weeks that's considered mass production rockets are mostly handmade machines, magnificent and main machines. So if you're able to facilitate the process, it's really good. 

Speaker 1  (08:28)
And additive manufacturing is not necessarily always the most optimal tool for mass production because of the nature of other to manufacturing but for rockets, if you're making one rocket every two weeks, this is mass production, so I don't do manufacturing can handle that, and it's perfectly suited what I said about not trusting anyone, but through data is the same thing we have been we became very accustomed and very comfortable with the 3 printing and the machine that we use and the materials because we have done so much research on it. 

Speaker 1  (08:59)
I have someone full-time, a PhD, Oscar, incredibly skilled, doing full-time work on understanding the printer, and we got so good at understanding our own printer and our manufacturing processes that we found mistakes and the data. Sheet provided by the manufacturer of the printer printers. So we would share with the man manufacturers like, okay, well, the data sheet that you shared to 60 companies. 

Speaker 1  (09:25)
Well, there's a mistake and the properties of the material because we tested it. And this is how we got it, and basically they had to correct the data sheet which is, you know, like I chose, how good we are with those printers, and that's the only way we're comfortable using it. We've worked with other suppliers as such. 

Speaker 1  (09:40)
So it's extensively used I think space and rockets tend to be very niche applications. Because as I said, you want to reduce complexity. And if you're manufacturing one part every two weeks, this is vast production. 

Speaker 1  (09:52)
So we're happy with that. 

Speaker 2  (09:54)
Okay makes completely sense so high five minutes. When you're talking about the mass production. I mean, you're obviously talking about some kind of using the 3 printers. 

Speaker 2  (10:06)
A lot What happens rather than just being accustomable? I mean, you would like to build a rocket from not from scratch but part of it between from scratch. Obviously you have to make something that doesn't exist. 

Speaker 2  (10:19)
Right. Imagine that VR, considering something exists, and it's out there when you try to compare this scenario that I'm using 3-D printer or I'm using the parts so which one is going to be more feasible? I know there are different kind of factors for you to consider the time. 

Speaker 2  (10:36)
The money does anything else. But do you have any challenge with that that we are going to say that okay, we need the part. But we cannot have it from outside, so we have to produce it. 

Speaker 2  (10:49)
What 

Speaker 1  (10:53)
We are in a very interesting and funny situation. Because the parts we manufacture were not hard to manufacture. I can manufacture my rocket. 

Speaker 1  (11:04)
My rocket engine with conventional methods. I would have maybe 3040 parts as we speak the heart of my rocket engine. Because we leverage added manufacturing a lot. 

Speaker 1  (11:16)
And because we're using a propulsion technology that is so conducive to three different things. We only have 3 parts. A typical rocket engine will have anywhere between 500 to 5000 parts, our rocket engine has only 3 parts, so three different for us has been magical. 

Speaker 1  (11:33)
Can the manufacturers somewhere else yeah, I can I can manufacture it with conventional methods. I'll just have more steps and it will take me more time. However. 

Speaker 1  (11:44)
We made the very first engine with a supplier using a Eos machine, which is great machine. It was supposed to date six weeks. We ended up needing 6 months because I had a lot of hard time printing the parts, and while they were printing it, they dropped it and you know, we had to redo it again and they had to depop. 

Speaker 1  (12:04)
It was complex for them. So 6 months when you're a startup, it's very, very precious time. You're more dependent on your mouthstones and momentum than 6 months. 

Speaker 1  (12:15)
You can kill the company with this. So we decided okay with all the time we wasted. It would have been better for us if we bought the printer. 

Speaker 1  (12:22)
If we buy the printer and we own the scheduling on it. And we do whatever we want, and we decided to buy, if we applied for funding where the government and we were successful securing it and we'd rather printer. So it kind of became an issue of and what's cool is the printer that we use is so unique. 

Speaker 1  (12:37)
And capabilities, we have been able to consolidate manufacturing and parts, so we had 4 parts we brought it down to 3, because we have been able to use a printer, because a printer is able to print some shapes that were not possible on the Eos, and that helped us consolidate further. And we learned how to use it. So 

Speaker 2  (12:57)
Perfect. Makes sense. One last question for this round. 

Speaker 2  (13:03)
The reuse printers, not for just producing part, but also for repairing part. Yes, not not at just Okay? Because there was a concept that I reached in my mind. 

Speaker 2  (13:17)
Okay, I guess we're done so right now. Yeah, thank you very much for this. Some kind of the short time. 

Speaker 2  (13:22)
I got so much information. But don't forget to have the rescheduled if you don't mind, I mean, I do have other questions as well. I didn't have time for that, but this one5 minutes was fantastic. 

Speaker 1  (13:32)
We rescheduled another called. Do you have any timelines or deadline? 

Speaker 2  (13:37)
The timeline. No I don't have any deadline for that snow. 

Speaker 1  (13:40)
So I will reschedule something in about two weeks. And we'll be able to spend more time 

Speaker 2  (13:46)
That's fantastic. Perfect. Thank you. 

Speaker 2  (13:47)
Thank you very much. Because with that. Drivers are up.
