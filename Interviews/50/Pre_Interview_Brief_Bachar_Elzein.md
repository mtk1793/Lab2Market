## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

Bachar is the founder and CEO/CTO of a **commercial space launch company** — one of the most demanding engineering environments for parts reliability, certification, and supply chain control. This interview is unique because:

1. **Extreme certification environment** — Space hardware has some of the most rigorous qualification requirements in existence. If AM parts can work in this context, it validates our entire approach at the highest possible bar.
2. **Defense angle** — Bachar is publicly engaged with Canada's Defence Industrial Strategy (Space Launch + Satellite Communications). This aligns with our DND/defense market expansion.
3. **Canadian sovereignty framing** — A Canadian commercial space CEO who cares about Canada's defense industrial base is naturally aligned with our "Canadian-first, sovereign resilience" positioning.
4. **AM in propulsion systems** — Rocket propulsion components (nozzles, combustion chambers, injectors) are increasingly AM-printed (SpaceX, Relativity Space, Rocket Lab). Bachar's team likely has direct experience or strong opinions on AM parts in high-performance, safety-critical systems.
5. **Cross-sector insight** — His perspective bridges aerospace, defense, and commercial tech in a way few people in Atlantic Canada can. This could unlock new market framing or partnership angles.

## INTERVIEW GOALS

- [ ] Understand how Reaction Dynamics manages parts supply chain for rocket systems (AM-printed components vs. traditional)
- [ ] Test whether AddManuChain's certification model applies in space/aerospace contexts
- [ ] Understand how Canada's Defense Industrial Strategy creates opportunities for Canadian AM platforms
- [ ] Explore IP and data security concerns in defense aerospace AM
- [ ] Get referrals into Canadian space sector, DND contacts, or Montreal-area defense aerospace network

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

**Q1 — AM in rocket propulsion:**
> *"Companies like SpaceX, Relativity Space, and Rocket Lab have made AM central to their propulsion manufacturing — Relativity went so far as to 3D-print 85% of their rocket. Where does Reaction Dynamics stand on AM for propulsion components? Are you printing any parts today, and if so, how do you handle the qualification and certification process for those parts?"*

**Q2 — Parts supply chain for a small launch company:**
> *"Running a rocket startup in Montreal means you're dealing with a global supply chain for very specialized components. When a critical part isn't available — or takes too long — what does that cost you in development time? Have you ever had a situation where you wished you could just print a replacement part locally and move on?"*

**Q3 — Certification at the extreme end:**
> *"Our platform targets marine and offshore industries, but we've been told: 'If you can certify for aerospace, everything else is easy.' You operate at the hardest end of the certification spectrum. From your experience with Transport Canada, FAA, or equivalent bodies — what would it actually take to get an AM-produced part certified for use in a propulsion system? And does the 'qualify once, reproduce without full re-cert' model that Lloyd's Register validated for marine AM translate to your world?"*

**Q4 — Canada's Defense Industrial Strategy and AM:**
> *"You've been posting about Canada's Defence Industrial Strategy — specifically Space Launch and Satellite Communications as priority areas. Do you see additive manufacturing and digital supply chains as part of Canada's sovereign defense industrial capacity? And is there a DND procurement angle where a Canadian platform like AddManuChain intersects with what you're building?"*

**Q5 — IP and cybersecurity in defense aerospace:**
> *"In a defense or space context, the IP in a manufacturing file is enormously sensitive — a rocket nozzle design or propellant injector spec is a national security asset. How does Reaction Dynamics handle IP protection with manufacturing partners? What would a digital inventory platform need to demonstrate on the cybersecurity and access control side before you'd trust it with your manufacturing files?"*

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

**B1 — Montreal defense aerospace network:**
> *"Montreal is Canada's aerospace capital — Bombardier, Pratt & Whitney, CAE, L3Harris, and dozens of SMEs. Is there a community of AM adopters in that ecosystem you're connected to? And is there a Quebec equivalent of the Lloyd's Register / CME NL network that we should be talking to for the aerospace MRO market?"*

**B2 — The commercial space → defense crossover:**
> *"Several commercial space companies (SpaceX, RocketLab) are now primary defense contractors. Is Reaction Dynamics on a dual-use trajectory — commercial launch + defense launch? And if the Canadian government mandates domestic launch capability as part of its defense strategy, what does the supply chain for that capability look like? Is digital AM inventory part of how you'd build it?"*

## KEY CONTEXT TO SHARE WITH BACHAR

- AddManuChain: Canadian platform for digital spare parts + AM production + certification-as-a-service
- Currently focused on offshore O&G, Canadian Navy, and Arctic remote operations
- Lloyd's Register has validated our pre-certified parts library model (qualify once, reproduce without re-certifying)
- Atlantic XL (St. John's) = first LR-certified AM facility in the Americas — our anchor manufacturing partner
- We believe "if you pass aerospace, everything else opens up" — and we're curious whether that pathway runs through companies like Reaction Dynamics
- We're exploring the defense mandate angle: DND/PSPC procurement that requires Canadian-platform connectivity down the supply chain

## IMPORTANT NOTE ON FRAMING

Bachar is a deep technical expert and an entrepreneur. **Don't pitch to him — ask his opinion.** He will be most useful if he challenges our assumptions about aerospace certification, not if he validates our positioning. Come in curious, not selling.

The most valuable outcome of this interview is NOT a sales lead — it's understanding whether our certification model translates to aerospace, and whether the defense mandate angle is realistic.
