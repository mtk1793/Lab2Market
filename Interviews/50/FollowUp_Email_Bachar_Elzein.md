# Follow-up Email: Bachar Elzein (Reaction Dynamics)

**Subject:** Thank You + AddManuChain & Scheduling Part 2 (Lab2Market)

**Body:**

Hi Bachar,

Thank you for making the time for our brief introductory call on February 20th, especially with your hiring interviews going on. Even in that short 15 minutes, your insights were incredibly valuable for our Lab2Market customer discovery.

Your point about Additive Manufacturing collapsing a 30–40 part traditional rocket engine design down into just 3 parts is a phenomenal real-world example of AM's consolidation power. It also perfectly illustrates why a trusted, certified digital library and production network is so necessary for high-value components. Additionally, your philosophy of "trust nobody, test everything" regarding supplier data sheets validates exactly why we are building a pre-certification process into the AddManuChain platform. 

As we discussed finding time for a longer conversation, I am eagerly waiting for our "Part 2" meeting. I'd love to dive deeper into how Reaction Dynamics specifically approaches sourcing and printing spare parts, and to explore if there might be future synergies between your advanced AM capabilities and other Canadian industries needing to de-risk their supply chains.

Please let me know what your schedule looks like over the next couple of weeks, and I'll make sure to accommodate it.

Looking forward to picking up where we left off!

Best regards,

Mahmoud (Michael) Kiasari
