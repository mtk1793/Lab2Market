# Interview - Dr. Ali Nasiri Analysis (Dalhousie University)

**Interview Date:** February 2026  
**Interviewee:** Dr. Ali Nasiri  
**Affiliation:** Dalhousie University  
**Expertise:** AM Certification, Oil & Gas Applications, Regulatory Frameworks  
**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Academic + Industry Bridge, Certification Expert)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Dr. Ali Nasiri provided **THE most comprehensive regulatory and certification perspective** on AM adoption barriers. As a Dalhousie professor with deep oil & gas industry connections, he validated that **Equinor and ExxonMobil are already implementing digital inventory** (Siemens subcontractor), confirmed **certification is THE bottleneck** (not technical capability), and revealed the "AM developed so fast that authorities couldn't catch up" problem. He's providing a contact list and identified **3 high-value AI opportunities** beyond digital inventory.

**Key Revelation:** The problem isn't "can AM work?" — it's "can we certify it fast enough?"

---

## 📊 Major Validations & Discoveries

### ✅ **EQUINOR + EXXONMOBIL DIGITAL INVENTORY (COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE)**

**Status:** **CRITICAL MARKET VALIDATION** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What Dr. Nasiri Said:**
> "Equinor did the same thing recently a few years ago and asked **Siemens as the subcontractor** to do the same for them. The digital inventory concept was there at least for their own work. Equinor and ExxonMobil were two big names who entered the AM and digital inventory in oil and gas industry."

**Strategic Implications:**

✅ **Problem VALIDATED at highest level:**
- Two oil & gas giants already investing in digital inventory
- Multi-year projects (not experiments)
- Siemens involved (enterprise-level solution)

⚠️ **Competitive Landscape:**
- Siemens already building this for Equinor
- You're not first to market (good = validates demand)
- Opportunity: Better solution than Siemens enterprise offering

🎯 **Their Strategy:**
> "They don't want to directly enter the AM yet they prefer to be connected with the concept and connect with other 3D printing facilities that could help them. They prefer to be connected to local facilities to not always ship parts from Europe or Norway."

**Key Insight:** **Platform model validated!**
- OEMs don't want to own AM equipment
- They want digital connection to local facilities
- "Send CAD file to fabricator via digital inventory close to location"

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Research Equinor-Siemens partnership (public announcements, whitepapers)
- [ ] Identify gaps in Siemens solution (likely enterprise-only, expensive)
- [ ] Position as "SME-accessible version of what Siemens built for Equinor"

---

### ✅ **CERTIFICATION = PRIMARY BOTTLENECK (NOT TECHNICAL CAPABILITY)**

**Status:** **HIGHEST BARRIER VALIDATED** (More than business case!)

**Dr. Nasiri's Framework:**

**Why Certification is Hard:**

1. **"AM developed so fast that authorities couldn't catch up"** ← Best quote
2. **Regulatory bodies (DNV, ASTM, Lloyd's Register) developing standards but:**
   - "All recommendations are too general"
   - "Not specifically talking about certain types of components"

**What Must Be Certified:**

| Item | Complexity | Cost Impact |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **The Part** | Materials testing, structural validation | High |
| **The Operator** | Personnel qualification | Medium |
| **The Powder/Feedstock** | Batch consistency, traceability | High |
| **Processing Variables** | Machine calibration, temperature, speed | High |
| **The Labs** | Third-party validation facility accreditation | Very High |

**Dr. Nasiri's Quote:**
> "The whole process is **costly and time demanding**. This application is for the part where the application is structural."

**Current Process:**
1. AM facility produces part
2. Contact registry (DNV, Lloyd's, ASTM)
3. Hire them as subcontractor
4. They provide "pathway" (not standardized)
5. Step-by-step validation using accredited labs
6. Part-by-part certification (no template reuse!)

**Why Oil & Gas Avoids AM:**
> "Oil and gas companies don't do mass production. One or 5 parts and they don't need to enter the certification process so they prefer to be more on the conventional side. **Even if AM could give them lots of opportunities, that certification alone causes lots of issues** so they don't like that process."

**Hypothesis NH.7 Update:** ❌ Was "Certification is A barrier" → ✅ **"Certification is THE barrier"**

---

### ✅ **STRUCTURAL vs NON-STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK (CRITICAL PIVOT)**

**Status:** **ADOPTION PATHWAY VALIDATED**

**Dr. Nasiri's Advice:**
> "**Focusing too much of your time on AM of structural parts could be challenging and time consuming. It would be better to focus on non-structural and less risky.** The part should be in the phase of **non-critical and non-simple manufacturing** section to be more acceptable."

**Definitions:**

**Structural Part:**
- Under loading and movement
- Higher risk of replacement
- Under a lot of stress
- Failure = operational chaos
- **Certification required** (costly, time-demanding)

**Non-Structural Part:**
- Not load-bearing
- Failure doesn't stop operations
- Easier to certify OR no certification needed
- **This is your entry point**

**Sweet Spot:** "Non-critical AND non-simple manufacturing"
- Complex enough that AM adds value (not just machining a block)
- Non-critical enough that certification is manageable

**Examples from Other Interviews:**
- Hopkins: Wire conduit trays (polymer, non-structural)
- Mark Kirby: Obsolete pump components (15-year-old parts)
- Atlantic Excel: Before-Christmas part delivery (urgent, lower risk)

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Update value prop: "Digital inventory for **non-structural** AM parts"
- [ ] Create structural/non-structural decision tree
- [ ] Interview Tronosjet (Mark Kirby) about their certified laser part process

---

### ✅ **AEROSPACE = EARLY ADOPTER BENCHMARK**

**Status:** **SUCCESS CASE STUDY VALIDATION**

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "Aerospace was one of the early adopters in this matter and they already put a lot of parts in this matter and they certified them. **Even in local companies like Tronosjet in PEI with Mark Kirby they certified a specific laser part for themselves.** They don't have to each time they produce specific part to enter the whole scenario of getting certification."

**Why This Matters:**

✅ **Pre-Certified Parts = Reusable Certification**
- Once certified, can produce repeatedly without re-certifying
- Tronosjet example: Local company (not Boeing) achieved this
- Mark Kirby involved (you've already interviewed him!)

**Business Model Opportunity:**
- Platform could track "pre-certified designs"
- Facilities upload: "We can produce X part (DNV certified, certificate #123)"
- OEMs search: "Show me certified Ti-6Al-4V brackets"

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Interview Mark Kirby follow-up: How did Tronosjet get certification?
- [ ] Research aerospace certification templates (FAA, EASA standards)
- [ ] Build "certified parts library" feature concept

---

### ⚠️ **DIGITAL INVENTORY = PARTIAL REPLACEMENT (NOT 100%)**

**Status:** **EXPECTATION CALIBRATION**

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "The whole idea of transition between physical to digital is interesting yet **you can't expect this matter happens completely, partially would be more logistic.** The main question is not about their defensive mode against AM, the idea is: **Is AM in the position to be the replacement of normal parts or not?** It can but the certification matters."

**Key Insight:**
- Stop selling "100% digital inventory replacement"
- Sell "Partial transition where it makes sense"
- Question isn't "will they adopt AM?" but "which parts justify certification cost?"

**Aligns with Jordan Cumming (Interview 10):**
- "5% solution is still worth solving"
- "Be really good at what is the right 5%"

**Updated Value Prop:**
From: "Replace physical inventory with digital inventory"  
To: **"Identify which 5-20% of physical inventory justifies AM + certification investment"**

---

## 🆕 THREE NEW AI OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED

### **AI Opportunity #1: Service Life Prediction & Predictive Maintenance**

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "The AI idea for the service life maintenance prediction is useful related to maintenance and repairment. **Ideas like service life prediction using AI.**"

**Why Important:**
- Predictive maintenance = know WHEN parts will fail
- Digital inventory = have replacement ready BEFORE failure
- Combined value: "AI predicts failure → Platform has certified part ready → No downtime"

**Status:** Separate from AM but **complementary value-add**

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Research: Service life prediction AI tools (current market)
- [ ] Interview Nicole (AI for Manufacturing) about this specific application

---

### **AI Opportunity #2: Corrosion Inspection (Halifax/Offshore)**

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "Another factor would be about the **inspection of the part. This idea could lead us to the corrosion aspect of parts specially where we live in Halifax or any offshore industrial** where they have to maintain the quality of their products all the time. **You are saving millions of dollars by using AI in that concept.**"

**Why Critical:**
- Halifax = maritime environment (high corrosion)
- Offshore oil & gas = constant corrosion monitoring required
- Current: Manual inspection, reactive replacement
- AI: Automated detection, predictive intervention

**Dr. Nasiri's Task:**
> "(Do some research over this part to see do we have any companies that can do that or not)"

**Potential Impact:** "Millions of dollars" in savings

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Research Halifax-based corrosion inspection companies
- [ ] Look for AI + corrosion monitoring startups
- [ ] Interview offshore operators about inspection pain points
- [ ] Explore: Computer vision + drone inspection for offshore structures

---

### **AI Opportunity #3: In-Process Defect Detection (HIGHEST TECHNICAL VALUE)**

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "Another use case of AI is in the whole production process where we use that alongside with other technologies like **IoT to find the deficiencies in the process and change some parameters based on that** to act lonely or be a good aid for the human operator... **Currently the systems right now is that they would wait for the part to be finished then check whether it's okay or not.** (Do research on this as it's very important section). **Proper tailoring is also important to stop the defection spreading.**"

**The Problem:**
- Current: Print part → Wait → Inspect → Discover it's defective → Waste time/material
- Cost: Entire print run wasted if defect discovered at end

**The Solution:**
- AI + IoT sensors monitor print in real-time
- Detect defects mid-process (temperature variance, layer adhesion issues)
- **Stop the defection from spreading** (pause, adjust parameters, or abort early)

**Dr. Nasiri's Assessment:**
> "This work is on the scale of **research** (good opportunity to focus on). Some people at US universities are working on it yet, **not a produced machine yet is there that can do the process yet.** It can reduce the cost so much."

**Why This is HUGE:**

✅ **Research opportunity** (PhD thesis potential!)  
✅ **No commercial product yet** (blue ocean)  
✅ **"Reduce cost so much"** (clear ROI)  
✅ **Addresses core AM problem:** "Reaching to the factor of real optimization needs a lot of effort that AI can help reduce the cycle process"

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Literature review: In-process AM defect detection (academic papers)
- [ ] Identify US universities working on this
- [ ] Research IoT sensors for AM machines (thermal cameras, acoustic sensors)
- [ ] Interview AM facility operators: "What % of prints fail? When do you discover defects?"
- [ ] **Potential pivot:** This could be a standalone PhD focus

---

## 🌍 GEOGRAPHIC ADOPTION TIMELINE

**Dr. Nasiri's Ranking:**
> "Digital inventory concept is still working on its initial phases and the real question is how quickly we can get there. **Europe goes there faster, then US, then Canada.**"

### **Europe (Leading)**
- Equinor Norway digital warehouse network (validated)
- Stronger regulatory frameworks (DNV, Lloyd's Register European HQ)
- Government support for AM adoption

### **United States (Following)**
- Hadrian autonomous factories (Interview 10 - Jordan)
- University research on in-process defect detection
- Aerospace early adoption (Boeing, SpaceX)

### **Canada (Lagging)**

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "Additive in Canada doesn't have that fast adoption in Canada like US or Europe. **Conviction of many local industry parts specially in Canada to being adopted with additive is challenging as it's understandable. They don't have that much of knowledge about the exact good usage of AM in their company.**"

**Why Canada is Slower:**
1. **Knowledge gap:** Don't understand where AM fits
2. **Trust gap:** Certification uncertainty
3. **Cost perception:** "AM part cost most of the time is higher than the normal one"

**Opportunity:**
- Education + business case tools = accelerate Canadian adoption
- Canada Makes Select AM tool (part of solution)
- Your platform: "Teach Canadian companies which parts justify AM investment"

---

## 💰 COST vs LEAD TIME TRADE-OFF

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "AM part cost most of the time is higher than the normal one yet, **the lead time is lower. We have to find the balance for each sector.** For sure the part would be higher in cost but we can claim that **we can deal with complexity better than the normal conditions.**"

**Framework for When AM Wins:**

| Scenario | Traditional Mfg | AM | Winner |
|----------|----------------|----|----|
| **Simple part, high volume** | Low cost, fast (tooling amortized) | High cost | Traditional |
| **Simple part, low volume (1-5)** | Medium cost, medium lead time | High cost, low lead time | Depends (urgency?) |
| **Complex part, high volume** | Tooling expensive but amortized | High per-unit cost | Traditional (eventually) |
| **Complex part, low volume** | Tooling + machining very expensive | High cost but no tooling | **AM WINS** |
| **Obsolete part (no supplier)** | Impossible or months lead time | High cost, days-weeks | **AM WINS** |
| **Urgent replacement (downtime = $1M/day)** | Weeks | Days | **AM WINS** |

**Your Platform's Role:**
- Input: Part complexity, volume, urgency, downtime cost
- Output: "Traditional vs AM" recommendation with ROI calculation
- **This is H50/H54 business case calculator!**

---

## 🏭 AM EQUIPMENT COST TRENDS

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "One of the reasons is that **the cost of equipment is getting down so more machines would be in access to users.** Currently each 3D printing machine could cost **more than $500K based on their envelope.**"

**Implications:**

**Barrier Lowering:**
- $500K+ → becoming affordable for mid-size shops
- "Each facility for sure does have at least one 3D printer Metal one"
- More distributed capacity = digital inventory network feasible

**But Still Expensive:**
- $500K = significant capex
- Utilization critical (can't sit idle)
- Digital platform helps: Match facility capacity → demand

**Platform Feature:**
- Facility capacity marketplace
- "I have a $500K machine sitting idle 60% of the time"
- "OEM needs urgent part 200km away"
- Platform matches → facility utilization ↑

## 📋 HYPOTHESIS UPDATES

### ✅ **STRONGLY VALIDATED:**

#### **NH.7 - Certification is THE Gatekeeper (Upgraded Status)**

**Evidence:**
- Oil & gas avoids AM specifically because of certification complexity
- Must certify: part + operator + powder + process variables + labs
- "Costly and time demanding"
- "AM developed so fast authorities couldn't catch up"
- Pre-certification (Tronosjet) is solution

**Status:** ❌ Changed from "A barrier" → ✅ **"THE PRIMARY BARRIER"** (even above business case!)

---

#### **NH.9 - Digital Inventory (But NOT AM-Specific)**

**Evidence:**
- Equinor + ExxonMobil already implementing (Siemens subcontractor)
- "Database right now is strong enough after years of development"
- Platform model: "Send CAD to local facility close to location"

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED** but **NOT AM-exclusive**  
- Digital inventory valuable independently
- AM is ONE manufacturing option in the digital system

---

#### **Structural vs Non-Structural (Critical Framework)**

**Evidence:**
- "Focus on non-structural and less risky"
- "Non-critical and non-simple manufacturing section"
- Aerospace certified structural parts (proof it's possible but hard)
- Oil & gas 1-5 parts/year = won't justify structural certification

**Status:** 🆕 **NEW FRAMEWORK** - adoption pathway identified

---

### 🆕 **NEW HYPOTHESES:**

#### **H60 - Pre-Certified Parts Library**

**Hypothesis:** AM adoption is hindered by lack of reusable certifications. A platform that catalogs pre-certified AM part designs (with certificate numbers, materials, facilities qualified to produce them) would dramatically lower adoption barriers for subsequent customers.

**Evidence:**
- Tronosjet certified laser part = can reproduce without re-certifying
- Aerospace already doing this
- Dr. Nasiri: "They don't have to each time produce specific part enter whole scenario of getting certification"

**Value:**
- First customer: Pays certification cost
- Subsequent customers: Order pre-certified design (no re-certification)
- Platform revenues: Transaction fees + certification tracking service

---

#### **H61 - In-Process Defect Detection (PhD Research Opportunity)**

**Hypothesis:** AM cost optimization is limited by post-production quality discovery. An AI + IoT system that detects defects mid-print and adjusts parameters in real-time would significantly reduce waste and accelerate AM cycle time.

**Evidence:**
- Dr. Nasiri: "Currently wait for part to be finished then check"
- "Proper tailoring to stop defection spreading"
- "US universities working on it, no produced machine yet"
- "Can reduce cost so much"

**Research Scope:**
- Computer vision for layer-by-layer analysis
- Thermal/acoustic sensors for real-time monitoring
- ML models trained on defect patterns
- Automated parameter adjustment (temperature, speed, powder feed)

**Commercial Potential:** High (no market solution exists yet)

---

#### **H62 - Corrosion Prediction for Offshore Assets**

**Hypothesis:** Halifax/offshore operators waste millions on reactive corrosion maintenance. AI-powered visual inspection (drones + computer vision) could predict corrosion failures and trigger just-in-time AM part orders via digital inventory before catastrophic failure.

**Evidence:**
- Dr. Nasiri: "Inspection of the part, corrosion aspect, where we live in Halifax or any offshore industrial"
- "You are saving millions of dollars using AI in that concept"
- Maritime environment = accelerated corrosion

**Integration with Digital Inventory:**
1. AI predicts: "This bracket will corrode to failure in 3 months"
2. Platform checks: Pre-certified replacement available?
3. Order from local AM facility
4. Install during planned maintenance (not emergency)

## 📧 FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TO DR. NASIRI

**Subject:** Thank You - Digital Inventory Discussion & Contact List Follow-Up

---

Hi Dr. Nasiri,

Thank you so much for the incredibly detailed conversation about AM adoption barriers, certification frameworks, and digital inventory implementations. Your insights have significantly shaped my research direction.

**Three immediate follow-ups based on your recommendations:**

**1. Research Tasks You Assigned:**

I'm diving into the following areas you identified as critical:

✅ **Equinor-Siemens Partnership**  
Researching the digital inventory project timeline and identifying gaps in enterprise solutions that an SME-focused platform could address.

✅ **Corrosion Inspection (Halifax/Offshore)**  
Surveying existing corrosion monitoring companies and AI-powered inspection startups. Your point about "saving millions of dollars" in offshore environments is compelling—I'll be interviewing operators to quantify this opportunity.

✅ **In-Process Defect Detection**  
Conducting literature review of US university research on real-time AM quality monitoring. Your assessment that "no produced machine exists yet" but "can reduce cost so much" suggests a significant research opportunity.

**2. Contact List Request:**

You mentioned you'd share a list of people who would be helpful for me to contact. I'm eager to connect with them—could you send that when convenient? I'm aiming to complete 100 interviews for Lab2Market, and introductions from you would carry significant weight.

**3. Key Takeaways I'm Acting On:**

✅ **Certification is THE barrier** (not just A barrier)  
Your framework helped me understand why oil & gas avoids AM despite opportunities: certification for 1-5 parts/year doesn't justify cost/time burden.

✅ **Focus on non-structural, non-critical parts first**  
I'm pivoting my value proposition from "replace all physical inventory" to "identify which 5-20% justifies AM + certification investment."

✅ **Pre-certified parts library** (Tronosjet example)  
The insight that Tronosjet certified a laser part and can now reproduce without re-certifying is a game-changer. I'm interviewing Mark Kirby to understand that process.

✅ **Three AI opportunities beyond digital inventory:**
- Service life prediction (predictive maintenance)
- Corrosion inspection (Halifax maritime environment)
- In-process defect detection (research opportunity)

**4. Potential Collaboration:**

Given Dalhousie's strengths in marine/offshore research and your expertise in AM certification, would you be open to a follow-up conversation in 4-6 weeks? I'd love to share:
- Findings from Equinor/ExxonMobil research
- Corrosion inspection market analysis
- Refined business model based on structural/non-structural framework

I'm also exploring whether in-process defect detection could be a PhD research component—your guidance on that would be invaluable.

Thank you again for your time and expertise. Looking forward to the contact list and staying connected!

Best regards,  
Mahmoud Kiasari  
PhD Candidate, Dalhousie University
