Hi [First Name],

Dr. Ali Nasiri from Dalhousie University's Faculty of Engineering suggested I reach out to you as someone with valuable insights into [specific domain: offshore operations/power systems/energy sector].

I'm Mahmoud Kiasari, a PhD candidate at Dalhousie working on additive manufacturing and digital inventory solutions for industrial operations. As part of the Lab2Market program, I'm conducting customer discovery interviews to validate whether this approach addresses real pain points in spare parts management, particularly for remote or offshore operations.

**What I'm exploring:**
- How industries currently manage spare parts inventory for critical equipment
- The role of certification and regulatory requirements in adopting new manufacturing approaches
- Where AI and digital tools could optimize inventory decisions (stock vs. on-demand manufacturing)

**I'd greatly appreciate 15-20 minutes of your time** to hear about your experience with [offshore maintenance/power systems operations/energy infrastructure]. Your perspective would be invaluable in shaping whether this solution addresses genuine market needs.

Dr. Nasiri mentioned your expertise in [specific area], and I'd love to learn from your insights.

Would you be open to a brief conversation in the coming weeks? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for considering this, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,  
**Mahmoud Kiasari**  
PhD Candidate, Electrical Engineering  
Dalhousie University  
Lab2Market Participant

## Interview Goals (Per Dr. Nasiri Context)

Based on Dr. Nasiri's background in **power systems, energy, and offshore renewable energy**, focus questions on:

1. **Offshore Wind/Energy Infrastructure:**
   - Spare parts challenges for offshore wind farms, tidal energy, remote substations
   - Predictive maintenance vs. reactive breakdown scenarios
   - Certification requirements for critical electrical/mechanical components

2. **Power Grid & Utility Operations:**
   - Transformer, switchgear, and substation component obsolescence
   - Emergency repair scenarios and downtime costs
   - Regulatory barriers to alternative manufacturing approaches

3. **Remote Operations:**
   - Parts availability for isolated installations
   - Supply chain constraints (Arctic, offshore platforms, remote grids)
   - Working capital tied up in "just-in-case" inventory

4. **AI & Digital Transformation:**
   - Current adoption of AI for predictive maintenance, inventory optimization
   - Appetite for platform-based solutions vs. in-house development
   - Data sharing concerns and IP protection requirements

---

## Success Metrics

- **Target:** 10-15 completed interviews from Dr. Nasiri's referral network
- **Timeline:** February-March 2026
- **Conversion Rate Goal:** 40-50% positive response rate
- **Follow-up Cadence:** 
  - Initial outreach → Wait 5-7 days
  - 1st follow-up → Wait 7 days
  - 2nd follow-up (final) → If no response, move to nurture list

## Key Talking Points (Elevator Pitch)

**30-Second Version:**
"I'm researching whether digital inventory combined with additive manufacturing can solve spare parts challenges for offshore and remote energy operations. The idea is: instead of stocking thousands of low-use parts 'just in case,' you maintain digital files and print on-demand when failures happen. I'm trying to understand if this matches reality, or if I'm solving a problem that doesn't exist."

**What Makes This Credible:**
- Lab2Market = validated accelerator program (100 expert interviews required)
- Dr. Nasiri's endorsement (Dalhousie faculty, recognized in power systems)
- Research-first approach (not selling, validating)
- Domain-specific questions (offshore wind, power infrastructure, remote ops)
