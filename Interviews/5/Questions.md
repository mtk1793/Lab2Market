## Strategic Interview Questions

### 1. The Dual Perspective: Supply Meets Demand

**Question:**

> "Tell me about a project where finding the right supplier or customer caused delays. What happened?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "How did you eventually solve it?"
- "What made that process frustrating?"
- "How much time did the delay cost you?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Gets concrete story (past behavior) instead of abstract opinion
- Reveals whether pain is on supplier-finding OR customer-finding side
- Quantifies real cost/impact of the problem
- Validates two-sided marketplace need with evidence

**Hypotheses tested:** H12 (idle capacity), H13 (high CAC), H25 (finding facilities)

### 2. The AI Implementation Reality Check

**Question:**

> "Tell me about the last time you tried implementing a new technology at Atlantic XL. What worked? What didn't?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "What made you decide to get the AI certification?"
- "Where do you see the biggest gap between what AI vendors promise and what actually works?"
- "If you could use AI to fix ONE thing in your operations, what would it be?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Past implementation experience reveals adoption barriers
- Tests AI skepticism/enthusiasm from certified expert
- Validates whether H54 (AI matching) is opportunity or liability
- Reveals whether to lead with "AI-powered" or hide it as background tech

**Hypotheses tested:** H54 (feasibility assessment AI), technology adoption readiness

### 3. Project Delay Root Causes

**Question:**

> "Tell me about the last project that got delayed. What caused it?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "When did you first realize it was behind schedule?"
- "How much of the delay was communication problems versus technical issues?"
- "How did you eventually resolve it? What did that cost you?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Concrete story reveals TRUE delay causes (not guesses)
- **CRITICAL VALIDATION** of H39 (real-time communication reduces delays 30-50%)
- Quantifies severity: small delays vs. major budget impacts
- Tests if communication is root cause or symptom

**Hypotheses tested:** H39 (VP.9 - real-time communication platform)

### 4. The Offshore Supply Chain Dilemma

**Question:**

> "Tell me about the last time Atlantic XL needed a specialized part fast—either for your offshore work or marine projects. What did you do?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "How did you source it? Did you air-freight it, find something local, or have it in inventory?"
- "What was frustrating about that process?"
- "How much did that solution cost (time and money)?"
- "If you could 3D print that part at a regional facility with 2-day delivery, would that have helped?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real emergency reveals TRUE decision-making priorities
- Tests offshore/marine AM opportunity (unique to Sean's experience)
- Validates regional AM hub concept with concrete use case
- **HIGH COST + HIGH EFFORT workaround** = major opportunity signal

**Hypotheses tested:** NEW - Regional AM hubs for offshore/marine, part categorization by risk/urgency

### 5. Quality vs. Quantity Matching

**Question:**

> "Tell me about the last time you needed to find a new supplier with a specialized capability Atlantic XL didn't have in-house. How did you find them?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "How many options did you look at before deciding?"
- "What made you choose the one you chose?"
- "If you could have seen just 3 pre-qualified perfect matches instead of searching yourself, would that have been better or worse?"
- "What information would you need to trust those 3 were actually the right ones?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real supplier selection reveals ACTUAL decision criteria (not hypothetical preferences)
- **CRITICAL VALIDATION** of H43 (quality-over-quantity matching)
- Tests whether they want marketplace breadth OR curated precision
- Reveals trust requirements for algorithmic matchingform recommendations

**Hypotheses tested:** H43 (VP.11 - quality-over-quantity matching algorithm)

## Follow-Up / Probing Questions

### If he mentions capacity utilization challenges:
- "What percentage of your manufacturing capacity is typically idle?"
- "What prevents you from filling that capacity—is it lack of demand, lack of *qualified* demand, or something else?"
- "Would you be willing to pay a marketplace commission (say, 10-15%) if it brought you qualified leads that converted into profitable work?"

### If he mentions supplier discovery challenges:
- "How much time does your team spend finding and vetting suppliers for specialized needs?"
- "Have you ever walked away from a project opportunity because you couldn't find a reliable supplier in time?"
- "What would make you trust a new supplier you found through an online platform vs. a personal referral?"

### If he's enthusiastic about AI/digital transformation:
- "If you could wave a magic wand and have AI solve *one* operational problem at Atlantic XL, what would it be?"
- "What would convince you to adopt a new AI-powered tool—case studies, pilot program, ROI guarantees?"

### If he mentions certification/quality challenges:
- "How do you currently verify that suppliers meet quality standards for safety-critical applications (marine, offshore)?"
- "Would digital certification badges from recognized labs (like NRC or others) give you confidence to work with a new supplier?"

## Research Context & Closing Statement

**When to share:** After asking the questions and understanding pain points from both perspectives

### Project Introduction

> "I've asked these questions because my PhD research focuses on **AddManuChain**, a platform designed to connect manufacturers who need parts with certified 3D printing facilities—essentially solving both sides of the problem you described. What makes your perspective invaluable is that you sit on *both* sides of this equation: Atlantic XL provides manufacturing services AND procures from suppliers. By understanding your challenges from both angles, I'm trying to build something that works for real operators—not just in theory, but in practice. I'd love to stay in touch as this develops and get your feedback on whether what we're building would actually solve the problems you face day-to-day."

## Interview Strategy Notes

**Opening approach:**
- Start with dual perspective question (differentiates this interview from others)
- Acknowledge his unique position bridging supply and demand
- Emphasize practical implementation over theoretical concepts

**Mid-interview:**
- Dig deep into communication costs (H39 validation)
- Explore offshore/marine specifics (unique domain knowledge)
- Test AI enthusiasm vs. skepticism (gauges early adopter potential)

**Closing:**
- Validate quality-over-quantity matching (H43 from Bassey)
- Ask about platform trust requirements
- Explore willingness to pilot/test solutions

**Post-interview:**
- Request introductions to other Atlantic XL team members (engineering, procurement)
- Explore potential partnership/pilot with Atlantic XL
- Follow up on offshore/marine-specific use cases
