## Hypotheses to Validate

### HIGH PRIORITY

**H12 (CP.4):** Idle Capacity
- Does Atlantic XL experience 30-40% idle machine capacity?
- What are current capacity utilization rates?
- What prevents filling this capacity?

**H13 (CP.5):** Customer Acquisition Costs
- How much does Atlantic XL spend to acquire new clients?
- What are the most effective channels?
- Would a marketplace reduce CAC?

**H39 (VP.9):** Real-Time Communication Platform
- **CRITICAL VALIDATION** - Bassey mentioned this for ALL segments
- How does Atlantic XL communicate with clients during projects?
- What communication delays cause project issues?

**H40 (VP.10):** Demand Forecasting & Pipeline Visibility
- How far ahead can Atlantic XL plan production?
- Is demand predictable or reactive?
- Would 2-4 week visibility vs. 1 week be valuable?

**H43 (VP.11):** Quality-Over-Quantity Matching
- When Atlantic XL seeks partners/suppliers, do they want many options or right options?
- How do they filter/qualify potential partners?

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

**H25 (VP.1):** Find Facilities in Minutes
- From client perspective: How does Atlantic XL find specialized suppliers?
- How long does sourcing typically take?

**H28 (VP.4):** Qualified Client Pipeline
- Would Atlantic XL pay commission (10-15%) for qualified leads?
- What defines a "qualified" lead?

**H29 (VP.5):** Certification Badges
- How does Atlantic XL prove capabilities to new clients?
- Are certifications a differentiator?

### ENERGY/MARINE SPECIFIC

**NEW:** Offshore/Remote Location Challenges
- How do lead times impact offshore projects?
- What parts are most difficult to source for marine/offshore applications?
- Are there categories of parts suitable for local AM production?

**NEW:** Environmental Constraints (from Jason interview)
- Validation of on-board AM feasibility
- Regional hub model vs. on-site production
- HVAC, humidity, salt air considerations
