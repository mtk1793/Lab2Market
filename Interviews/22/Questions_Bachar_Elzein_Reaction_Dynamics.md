## Strategic Relevance

| Factor | Relevance to Lab2Market |
|--------|------------------------|
| **USES AM FOR PRODUCTION** | ✅ Direct user of additive manufacturing for engines! |
| **Space Industry** | HIGH PRIORITY sector |
| **Québec Company** | Links to PRIMA/Fanny Charreteur ecosystem |
| **CSA Funded** | Government validation, defense potential |
| **Combustion/Propulsion** | High-performance, certification-critical parts |
| **Startup** | May be more open to digital inventory concepts |

> **CRITICAL:** This company **already uses AM for engine manufacturing** - they are an ideal customer discovery target!

## Interview Questions

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

1. **Thank you for taking the time! Can you tell me about Reaction Dynamics and what inspired you to build rockets in Québec?**

2. **What stage is the company at—have you conducted test flights? What's the roadmap?**

---

### Additive Manufacturing Deep Dive (12 minutes)

3. **I understand Reaction Dynamics uses additive manufacturing for your RE-101 engine. Can you walk me through how AM fits into your production process?**
   - *Probe:* What specific components are 3D printed?
   - *Probe:* What AM technology/materials do you use (SLM, EBM, etc.)?
   - *Probe:* What percentage of the engine is AM vs. traditional?

4. **Why did you choose additive manufacturing for these components? What advantages does it provide?**
   - *Probe:* Design complexity? Weight reduction? Lead time?
   - *Probe:* Would traditional manufacturing even be possible for these parts?

5. **What are the biggest challenges you face with AM for rocket engines?**
   - *Probe:* Material properties? Surface finish? Certification?
   - *Probe:* Quality consistency? Post-processing?

6. **How do you handle certification for AM parts in propulsion systems?**
   - *Probe:* What testing/validation is required?
   - *Probe:* Who certifies—CSA? FAA? Transport Canada?
   - *Probe:* Is certification a bottleneck?

7. **Do you manufacture AM parts in-house or use external service bureaus?**
   - *Probe:* If external, who do you use?
   - *Probe:* Any challenges with outsourcing AM?

---

### Spare Parts & Inventory (5 minutes)

8. **For non-engine components and spare parts, how do you currently manage inventory?**
   - *Probe:* Do you stock critical spares?
   - *Probe:* What happens if a part fails during a test campaign?

9. **I'm researching digital inventory—storing part files digitally and printing on-demand instead of warehousing. Would that concept be valuable for Reaction Dynamics?**
   - *Probe:* Which parts would be candidates?
   - *Probe:* What would be barriers?

10. **For a startup like Reaction Dynamics, is working capital tied up in inventory a significant issue?**

---

### Supply Chain (3 minutes)

11. **Where do you source your AM materials and manufacturing services?**
    - *Probe:* Is "Made in Québec" / Canadian sourcing important?
    - *Probe:* Any supply chain vulnerabilities?

12. **Have you worked with any Québec AM companies like Solaxis, Proto3000, or others?**

---

### AI & Future (3 minutes)

13. **Do you use any AI or software tools for design optimization, predictive maintenance, or inventory management?**
    - *Probe:* Interest in AI-driven decisions on what to stock vs. print?

14. **Where do you see rocket propulsion and AM intersecting in the next 5-10 years?**

---

### Closing (2 minutes)

15. **What advice would you give to someone building technology for the space industry?**

16. **Is there anyone else in the Québec or Canadian space ecosystem you'd recommend I speak with?**
    - *Probe:* Connection to Christophe Leclerc (also at Reaction Dynamics in my lead list)?

17. **Would you be open to a follow-up or potentially a pilot if we develop something relevant?**

## Key Hypotheses to Validate

- [ ] AM is used for production (not just prototyping) in space propulsion
- [ ] Certification is a significant barrier for AM adoption
- [ ] Startups have different pain points than large companies
- [ ] Digital inventory concept is relevant for space startups
- [ ] Québec AM ecosystem is accessible and capable

---

## Connection Points

- **Christophe Leclerc** - Also listed at Reaction Dynamics in Golden Path leads
- **Oscar Sanchez-Mata** - Also at Reaction Dynamics
- **PRIMA Québec / Fanny Charreteur** - Québec advanced materials ecosystem
- **Harvey Doane** - Space industry context
- **Alexandre Bois-Brochu (CMQ)** - Québec metallurgy/materials

---

## Pre-Interview Research

- [ ] Watch "Meet the Drapers" pitch video
- [ ] Review RE-101 engine specifications
- [ ] Check for recent news/test results
- [ ] Look for AM case studies in rocket propulsion

---

## Notes

This is a **CRITICAL** interview because:
1. **Already using AM for production** - Direct validation of market
2. **Rocket engines** - High-performance, certification-critical application
3. **CSA funded** - Government credibility
4. **Québec startup** - Links to PRIMA ecosystem
5. **"Made in Québec"** - Aligns with Canadian sovereignty theme
