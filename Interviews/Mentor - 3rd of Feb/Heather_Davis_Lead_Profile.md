### **1. Digitalization Leadership**
- Leading the growth and implementation of **Omega 365** (digital Project and Asset Management solution)
- Strategic leader bridging traditional engineering and digital asset management
- Hiring technical talent (Business Analysts) for Aker's local digitalization team

### **2. TEAMCENTER (PLM Software) - CRITICAL OVERLAP**
- **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** for development and implementation of **Teamcenter** for design reviews and certifications at DNV
- This is EXACTLY the type of digital inventory/PLM system you're researching
- She understands the gap between legacy systems and AI-powered automation

### **3. Quality Management & Certification - YOUR PLATFORM'S VALUE PROP**
- Expert in **regulatory certification** for offshore structures (C-NLOPB, Transport Canada, DNV standards)
- Deep experience in **quality management** for offshore units
- Your AI-driven QA platform is the **automated future** of the manual certification work she has done for 15+ years

### **4. Designer Perspective (Hopkins' Recommendation)**
- Hopkins specifically said: "Talk to designers who identify which components are AM candidates"
- Heather's 12+ years at DNV involved **design reviews** for offshore structures
- She knows how to identify which parts can be digitized, certified, and manufactured using AM vs traditional methods

## 🎯 **WHY THIS MATTERS TO YOUR RESEARCH**

### **Perfect Technical Match:**
1. **Digital Inventory:** She implemented Teamcenter (PLM) at DNV—you're building the next-gen AI version
2. **Certification Barrier:** She spent a career doing manual certification—your platform automates it
3. **Designer Lens:** She identifies AM candidates for offshore—exactly NH.7 certification hypothesis testing
4. **Omega 365 Adoption:** She's leading digital transformation at Aker RIGHT NOW—real-time pain points

### **Hypothesis Validation:**
- **NH.7** - Certification as Barrier: She can quantify certification timeline/costs for offshore AM parts
- **H50/H54** - Part Identification Tool: She does this manually today—can validate your AI business case calculator
- **VP.12** - Certification Decision Support: Her Teamcenter expertise = proof that digital certification tools are adopted
- **CS.1** - Designer → Manufacturer Handoff: She works with Atlantic Excel (Hopkins confirmed)—can explain current workflow gaps

### **LinkedIn Connection Request** (300 character limit)

> "Hi Heather, Dwayne Hopkins suggested I reach out. I'm Mahmoud Kiasari, a PhD Candidate at Dalhousie (Lab2Market program) researching AI-driven QA for industrial digital inventory. Not a sales pitch—I'd value 15 mins to hear your view on digitalization hurdles in offshore ops. Thanks!"

### **Outreach Email**

**Subject:** Research Inquiry: AI-Driven QA & Digitalization (Referral: Dwayne Hopkins)

Hi Heather,

My name is Mahmoud Kiasari, and I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering at Dalhousie University. I am currently participating in the Lab2Market program, where I am developing an **AI-driven digital inventory and quality-assurance platform** for on-demand manufacturing in remote industrial environments.

I was recently speaking with **Dwayne Hopkins** at the Co-Innovation Center, and he recommended I connect with you given your extensive background in **quality management, Teamcenter implementation**, and your current focus on **Digitalization** at Aker Solutions.

**To be clear, this is not a sales pitch.** I am in the discovery phase of my research and am specifically looking to validate technical assumptions regarding **automated QA and digital certification pathways**. Your experience as a **Subject Matter Expert for Teamcenter (PLM)** at DNV and your current work leading the **Omega 365** digital transformation makes you an ideal person to comment on how AI-driven tools can realistically replace or support traditional verification processes in offshore manufacturing.

**What I'm researching:**
- How AI can automate part identification for AM suitability (vs manual design reviews)
- Digital certification pathways to accelerate offshore AM adoption
- The gap between legacy PLM systems (Teamcenter) and next-gen AI-powered platforms

**What I'd love to learn from you:**
1. What are the biggest digitalization bottlenecks you're encountering at Aker with Omega 365?
2. For offshore AM parts, what's the current certification timeline and cost? (I'm hearing "months to years" and "prohibitively expensive" from others)
3. Would AI-powered design review tools (that auto-flag AM candidates and generate business case analysis) be valuable to your digitalization roadmap?

Would you be open to a brief **15-minute chat** sometime next week? I would be happy to share my findings on AI-driven defect detection in return for your perspective on where digital tools succeed vs. where traditional engineering judgment is still critical.

**Best regards,**

Mahmoud Kiasari

## ⏰ **STRATEGIC TIMING FOR SEND**

Since Heather is based in **St. John's, Newfoundland (NST)**, remember the **30-minute time jump** ahead of Halifax (AST).

### **Recommended Send Time:**

**Best Days:** Tuesday or Wednesday (mid-week, post-Monday chaos, pre-Friday wind-down)

**Your Time (AST):** 8:45 AM – 9:15 AM  
**Her Local Time (NST):** 9:15 AM – 9:45 AM

**Rationale:**  
As a **Sr. Project Advisor**, her days are likely structured around:
- Morning project scrums (8:00-9:00 AM NST)
- Stakeholder meetings (10:00 AM+ NST)
- Afternoon digitalization workshops

**Catching her at 9:15 AM NST** (right after morning standup, before deep meetings) is the **sweet spot** to stand out in her inbox without getting buried in end-of-day email overload.
