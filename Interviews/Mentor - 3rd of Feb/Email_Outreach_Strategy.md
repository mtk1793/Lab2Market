## 🎯 Strategic Context from Hopkins Meeting

### **Key Insights:**

1. **Non-Structural Parts Focus VALIDATED:**
   - Hopkins: "Start with non-critical elements... low risk to get people comfortable"
   - Oil & gas uses AM for obsolete parts (15-year-old pump example)
   - Polymer vs metal consideration (wire conduit trays don't need metal)

2. **Digital Warehouse Gap CONFIRMED:**
   - Hopkins: "Vessels have $50-60M spare parts warehouse... can probably reduce the size"
   - Polyunity pivoting to digital warehouse positioning (November 2025 conversation with Hopkins)
   - Equinor building Norway digital warehouse network, wants same in Canada

3. **Three Stakeholder Types Identified:**
   - **Buyers:** Tyler (Esso), Brad (Equinor) - vessel operators
   - **Designers:** Heather (Aker Solutions) - identify which parts for AM
   - **Sellers:** Atlantic Excel (already interviewed Sean/John), Polyunity

4. **Cross-Sector Validation:**
   - Medical (Polyunity) facing same challenges as oil & gas
   - Both ask: "Why change what's working?" → Need to demonstrate dual-use success

5. **First Adopter Strategy:**
   - Big companies want proof from smaller operators first
   - Hopkins: "Talk to local vessel operators (lower risk) → build database → pitch to internationals"

## 📧 Email Templates

### **EMAIL 1: Jacqueline @ Polyunity (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

**Subject:** Introduction from John Hopkins - Digital Warehousing Research (Dalhousie PhD)

**Body:**

Hi Jacqueline,

John Hopkins from the Co-Innovation Center suggested I reach out to you. I'm a PhD student at Dalhousie University conducting customer discovery research on digital inventory/warehousing for AM operations, and John mentioned that Polyunity is making an exciting pivot in this direction.

**Why I'm reaching out:**

John mentioned you're evolving from one-off medical device production to positioning Polyunity as a digital warehouse with a catalogue of medical equipment. This is **exactly** the model I'm researching—and interestingly, Mark Kirby (Canada Makes, metal AM) independently recommended Polyunity as a success story for remote/regulated environments.

**What I'd love to learn from you:**

1. What challenges did you face building your component database over 5 years?
2. How do you balance standardized catalogue vs custom one-offs?
3. What role does certification/regulatory compliance play in medical AM?
4. Have you explored AI for demand forecasting or inventory optimization?

**Cross-sector insight:** I'm also talking to oil & gas companies (Equinor, Esso, Aker Solutions) facing similar digital warehouse questions. The challenges Hopkins described (trust, risk aversion, "why change?") mirror what you've navigated in medical—so your insights would be invaluable for understanding how to overcome adoption barriers.

**I'm doing 100 interviews for Lab2Market @ Dalhousie.** Would you have 30 minutes in the next 2 weeks for a quick call? Happy to work around your schedule.

Thanks for considering!

Best regards,  
Mahmoud Kiasari  
PhD Candidate, Dalhousie University

### **EMAIL 2: Heather Davis @ Aker Solutions**

**Subject:** Referral from John Hopkins - AM Digital Inventory Research

**Body:**

Hi Heather,

John Hopkins recommended I connect with you. I'm a PhD student at Dalhousie University researching digital inventory platforms for additive manufacturing in the oil & gas sector.

**Why John thought you'd be perfect to talk to:**

As part of Aker Solutions' digitalization team, you work with the **designers** who identify which components are AM candidates—which is the exact problem I'm trying to solve at scale. John mentioned Aker collaborates closely with Atlantic Excel (I've interviewed Sean Morgan and John Lidstone) on AM pilot projects.

**What I'd love to understand:**

1. **Designer perspective:** When engineering offshore components, how do you currently decide "AM vs traditional manufacturing"?
2. **Certification challenges:** What's the qualification process for AM parts in regulated environments?
3. **Digital tools:** Are you using any software/platforms to manage AM part specifications, or is it still manual?
4. **Collaboration:** How does the handoff work between Aker (design) → Atlantic Excel (manufacture) → client (deploy)?

**Research context:** I'm exploring AI-powered tools to help companies identify which parts have strong AM business cases (cost/risk/lead time trade-offs). Your insights as a designer working with real offshore projects would be incredibly valuable.

Would you have 30 minutes for a call in the next couple of weeks? I'm flexible on timing.

Thanks so much!

### **EMAIL 3: Tyler Beatty @ Esso/ExxonMobil**

**Subject:** Introduction from John Hopkins - AM Research & Memorial University Collaboration

**Body:**

Hi Tyler,

John Hopkins from the Co-Innovation Center suggested I reach out. I'm a PhD student at Dalhousie University conducting research on digital inventory and AI applications for additive manufacturing in the energy sector.

**Why John recommended you:**

He mentioned you're in Esso's innovation space and are investing in AM research at Memorial University—which makes you a perfect person to understand both the **buyer perspective** (what would make Esso adopt digital warehousing) and the **research-to-industry** translation challenge.

**What I'd love to learn:**

1. **Buyer needs:** When evaluating AM solutions, what are Esso's top decision criteria? (Cost? Reliability? Certification? Lead time?)
2. **Research investment:** What gaps are you hoping Memorial's AM research will address?
3. **Digital warehouse appetite:** Would a platform that categorizes parts by AM suitability + provides business case analysis be valuable?
4. **Pilot project criteria:** What would success look like for a small-scale AM trial on vessel equipment?

**Context:** I'm doing 100 customer discovery interviews for Dalhousie's Lab2Market program. I've spoken with AM service providers (Atlantic Excel) and designers (Aker Solutions next), and you'd complete the "buyer" perspective.

Would you have 20-30 minutes in the next few weeks?

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings from Hopkins Meeting

### **1. Big Companies Want Dual-Use Proof**

**Hopkins Quote:**
> "They love talking about dual-use. Where was it used in a commercial sense vs my industry? Who were the first adopters?"

**Implication:**
- Don't pitch to Equinor/Esso without smaller operator success stories
- Polyunity → local vessesls → international oil companies (that's the path)

---

### **2. Equinor Timing is CRITICAL**

**Hopkins Warning:**
> "$10 billion project... things go quiet a few months before announcement... don't be discouraged if they don't get back to you"

**Action:**
- ⏰ **DO NOT email Brad Elliot until AFTER March announcement**
- Hopkins will tell you when it's safe (weekly mentor meetings)
- If you email now = ignored/annoyed

---

### **3. Non-Structural Parts Only (At First)**

**Hopkins Insight:**
> "Start with non-critical elements... low risk... wire conduit trays don't need metal, use polymer"

**Implication for Emails:**
- Frame questions around "low-risk use cases"
- Don't promise to replace critical structural components
- Polymer AND metal applicability

---

### **4. Sellers + Designers + Buyers = Complete Picture**

**Hopkins Framework:**

| Stakeholder | Who | What They Need |
|-------------|-----|----------------|
| **Sellers** | Atlantic Excel, Polyunity | Orders, demand forecasting |
| **Designers** | Heather (Aker Solutions) | Part identification tools, specs |
| **Buyers** | Tyler (Esso), Brad (Equinor) | Cost justification, reliability proof |

**Your Platform Must Serve All Three:**
- Sellers: Digital warehouse interface
- Designers: Business case calculator (H50/H54)
- Buyers: Dual-use proof, sovereignty risk dashboard (H57)
