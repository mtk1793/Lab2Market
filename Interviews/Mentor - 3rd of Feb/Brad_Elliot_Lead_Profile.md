# Lead Profile: Bradley (Brad) Elliott, M.Eng, P.Eng
## Equinor - Principal Engineer (Technology Development)

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL TIMING NOTE - DO NOT CONTACT UNTIL MARCH 2026**

Per Dwayne Hopkins' explicit warning during your mentor meeting:

> "Equinor locally is going through a project trying to get a project rewarded for off Newfoundland Labrador, which they are planning to make the announcement either good or bad. But the announcement is coming in the next month or so. **A lot of communication has gone silent** simply because they don't want to talk about say anything that like Persuade Media or anything like that to get a hold of where the direction all of this contract award is going... **Don't be discouraged if anybody from Equinor doesn't get back to you.** After the announcement and you'll see announcement. If they're talking about a **$10 billion dollar project**, you'll hear it. **After that, I'll talk to you no problems.**"

**ACTION:** Wait until **after March 2026** to send outreach. Monitor news for Equinor's $10B offshore Newfoundland project announcement, then reach out **immediately after** the news breaks.

Hi Brad,

My name is Mahmoud Kiasari, and I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering at Dalhousie University. I am currently participating in the Lab2Market program, where I am developing an **AI-driven digital inventory and quality-assurance platform** for on-demand manufacturing in remote industrial environments.

I was recently speaking with **Dwayne Hopkins** at the Co-Innovation Center, and he recommended I connect with you given your extensive background in **additive manufacturing**, **material and corrosion technology**, and your current work replicating **Equinor's Norway digital warehouse network** in Atlantic Canada.

**To be clear, this is not a sales pitch.** I am in the discovery phase of my research and am specifically trying to understand how **digital warehouse networks** operate at enterprise scale in harsh offshore environments. Your experience with Equinor's **Norway AM digital warehouse model** and the **Atlantic Excel pilot project** makes you an ideal person to comment on what works in theory vs what works in practice for offshore operations.

**What I'm researching:**
- AI-powered part identification for AM suitability (automating material science design reviews)
- Digital certification pathways to accelerate offshore AM adoption (automating C-NLOPB/DNV compliance)
- Learning from Equinor Norway's digital warehouse network to understand best practices

**What I'd love to learn from you:**
1. **Norway Digital Warehouse:** What makes Equinor's Norway digital warehouse network successful? What's the gap between Norway's model and Atlantic Canada's readiness?
2. **Atlantic Excel Pilot:** What did the AM pilot project teach you about offshore part suitability? What worked vs what failed?
3. **Certification Costs:** For offshore AM parts in Material & Corrosion scope, what's the typical certification timeline and cost? (I'm hearing "months to years" and "prohibitively expensive" from others)
4. **Part Identification:** How do you currently identify which offshore components are AM candidates vs traditional manufacturing? (Manual design review? Material science analysis?)
5. **Buyer Decision Factors:** When evaluating AM vs physical inventory, does Equinor prioritize **speed** (faster delivery to offshore rigs), **cost** (reducing warehouse overhead), or **quality** (reliability/certification confidence)?

I know Equinor is leading the industry in digital warehouse adoption, so I'm hoping to learn from your expertise rather than trying to reinvent what's already working in Norway.

Would you be open to a brief **15-minute chat** after the offshore project announcement settles? I would be happy to share my findings on AI-driven certification automation and cross-sector insights (medical AM digital warehouses) in return for your perspective on enterprise-scale digital warehouse operations.

**Best regards,**

Mahmoud Kiasari
