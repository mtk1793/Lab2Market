### **Outreach Email**

**Subject:** Research Inquiry: AI-Driven QA & Innovation ROI (Referral: Dwayne Hopkins)

Hi Tyler,

My name is Mahmoud Kiasari, and I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering at Dalhousie University. I am currently participating in the Lab2Market program, where I am developing an **AI-driven digital inventory and quality-assurance platform** for on-demand manufacturing in remote industrial environments.

I was recently speaking with **Dwayne Hopkins** at the Co-Innovation Center, and he recommended I connect with you given your role managing **research investments and innovation partnerships** at ExxonMobil, particularly your work funding **additive manufacturing research** at Memorial University.

**To be clear, this is not a sales pitch.** I am in the discovery phase of my research and am specifically trying to understand the **buyer perspective** on innovation ROI and technology adoption barriers in offshore oil & gas. Your experience managing the **R&D portfolio** and evaluating which technologies get funded makes you an ideal person to comment on what financial metrics actually matter when enterprises evaluate new platforms.

**What I'm researching:**
- AI-powered part identification for AM suitability (automating design review workflows)
- Digital certification pathways to accelerate offshore AM adoption
- Business case calculators that quantify ROI for digital inventory vs physical warehouse costs

**What I'd love to learn from you:**
1. **ROI Thresholds:** What return on investment do you need to see to approve research funding vs walking away? (Is it 2x? 5x? 10x?)
2. **Competitive Advantage:** When evaluating new technologies, do you prioritize **speed** (faster delivery), **cost** (cheaper than alternatives), or **quality** (reliability/certification)?
3. **Memorial AM Research:** What specific pain points is your Memorial University AM research trying to solve? (Part obsolescence? Certification barriers? Supply chain resilience?)
4. **Buyer vs Designer Gap:** How often do engineering teams recommend technologies that get rejected at the budget approval stage? What's the disconnect?

I know ExxonMobil is investing in AM research, so I'm hoping to learn what made that business case compelling vs other innovation investments that didn't get funded.

Would you be open to a brief **15-minute chat** sometime next week? I would be happy to share my findings on AI-driven defect detection and cross-sector insights (e.g., medical AM digital warehouses) in return for your perspective on enterprise innovation decision-making.

**Best regards,**

Mahmoud Kiasari

## ⏰ **STRATEGIC TIMING FOR SEND**

Since Tyler is based in **St. John's, Newfoundland (NST)**, remember the **30-minute time jump** ahead of Halifax (AST).

### **Recommended Send Time:**

**Best Days:** Tuesday or Wednesday (mid-week, Hopkins said Tyler is in the "innovation space" so likely has standing meetings Mondays/Fridays)

**Your Time (AST):** 8:45 AM – 9:15 AM  
**His Local Time (NST):** 9:15 AM – 9:45 AM

**Rationale:**  
As a **Research & Training Lead**, his days are likely structured around:
- Morning R&D team standups (8:00-9:00 AM NST)
- University partnership meetings (10:00 AM+ NST)
- Afternoon innovation portfolio reviews

**Catching him at 9:15 AM NST** (right after morning team sync, before external meetings) is the **sweet spot** to get on his radar without competing with end-of-day email overload.

## 🔥 **PRE-SEND CHECKLIST**

Before sending LinkedIn/Email:

- [ ] Confirm email address (tyler.w.beatty@esso.ca is provided by user—likely accurate)
- [ ] Double-check Dwayne Hopkins' name spelling (it's "Dwayne," not "Dwayne")
- [ ] Prepare 3-4 specific questions about Memorial AM research (shows you did homework)
- [ ] Review Hopkins' notes about Tyler's role (innovation space, research investments, buyer perspective)
- [ ] Set calendar reminder to follow up 1 week later if no response
- [ ] **Emphasize you're NOT selling anything** (researchers get pitched constantly—make it clear this is discovery)

---

## 🎯 **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### **High Probability Response Drivers:**
1. ✅ **Hopkins warm intro** (Tyler trusts Dwayne's judgment from Co-Innovation Center network)
2. ✅ **Memorial University connection** (Dalhousie-MUN academic collaboration angle)
3. ✅ **You're not selling anything** (research = safe, low-pressure conversation)
4. ✅ **AM research is his current mandate** (he's funding this RIGHT NOW at MUN)
5. ✅ **Innovation is his job** (evaluating new tech is literally what he does daily)

### **If He Responds:**
- **Ask about:** Memorial AM research goals, ROI thresholds for innovation funding, buyer vs designer disconnect
- **Offer:** AI design review findings, cross-sector digital warehouse insights (Polyunity medical, Equinor Norway network)
- **Next steps:** Request intro to ExxonMobil offshore operations team or procurement contacts

### **If No Response After 1 Week:**
- **Follow up via Hopkins:** "Dwayne, I reached out to Tyler but haven't heard back—any chance you could give him a nudge? Totally understand if he's swamped with R&D portfolio reviews."
- **Alternative:** Ask Hopkins for **other ExxonMobil innovation contacts** or MUN AM researchers Tyler funds

---

## 🎯 **INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO PREPARE** (Carol-Aligned)

Based on Carol's directives and Tyler's buyer role:

### **1. Cost Quantification:**
- "What's the current cost of maintaining physical inventory for offshore rigs? (Hopkins mentioned $50-60M in stock)"
- "How do you calculate downtime cost when evaluating new technologies?" 
- "For the Memorial AM research you're funding, what cost savings would make it 'worth it'?"

### **2. Buyer Identification & Budget Authority:**
- "Walk me through how R&D funding decisions get made at ExxonMobil. Who else has to approve beyond you?"
- "What's the typical approval threshold for innovation investments? (e.g., <$100K you approve, >$1M needs corporate?)"
- "How do you evaluate competing research proposals? What metrics matter most?"

### **3. Competitive Advantage:**
- "When you funded Memorial's AM research, was the business case primarily about **speed** (faster part delivery), **cost** (cheaper than physical inventory), or **quality** (reliability/certification)?"
- "If I could guarantee 50% faster part delivery but at 20% higher cost, would that be compelling? Or vice versa?"
- "What would make you switch from physical inventory to digital warehouse? (10x ROI? 2x ROI?)"

### **4. Certification & Trust Barriers:**
- "For offshore AM parts, what's the current certification timeline and cost?"
- "Would AI-powered certification tools (that auto-generate compliance documentation) speed up adoption?"
- "What makes you trust a new technology enough to deploy it offshore vs keeping legacy solutions?"

## 🚀 **ACTION ITEMS**

1. **Send LinkedIn connection request** (Tuesday 8:45 AM AST = 9:15 AM NST)
2. **Send email 30 minutes later** (Tuesday 9:15 AM AST = 9:45 AM NST)

## 🔑 **KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHT (From Hopkins):**

Hopkins said you need **three perspectives**:
1. ✅ **Seller (Atlantic Excel):** Sean Morgan & John Lidstone  
2. ✅ **Designer (Aker Solutions):** Heather Davis  
3. ✅ **Buyer (ExxonMobil):** **Tyler Beatty** ← YOU ARE HERE

Tyler completes this triangle. He can explain:
- Why buyers approve AM vs reject it (business case criteria)
- What ROI threshold matters (Carol's critical metric)
- How innovation budgets work (procurement vs R&D funding)
- Why Memorial research got funded (proof concept for your platform)

**CRITICAL REMINDER:**  
Tyler represents the **buyer with budget authority**—exactly what Carol demanded you identify. If he says "I'd pay for this," you have validation. If he says "wouldn't invest," you need to understand why and pivot your value proposition accordingly.

This is a **make-or-break interview** for validating your business model. Prepare accordingly.
