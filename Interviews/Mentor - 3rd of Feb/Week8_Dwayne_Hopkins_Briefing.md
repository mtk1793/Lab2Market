### 5 Key Breakthroughs This Week

**1. Lloyd's Register Group Meeting (Feb 18) — Most Important Interview Yet**
Three LR experts in one call: Trevor Butler (Offshore BD, St. John's), Adam Saxty (Lead AM Technologist, UK), Dave Whitehouse (Naval/Defense, Dartmouth). Key outcome:
- **Atlantic XL in St. John's just received LR facility qualification** — first certified AM facility in the entire Americas (North + South). This is our anchor manufacturing partner. *You mentioned Atlantic XL and Sean Morgan in our last meeting — this is that company, now LR-certified.*
- **Certification is front-loaded, not recurring** — facility qualification and part qualification happen once. Subsequent orders = print + test coupon. This makes our pre-certified parts library model fully viable.
- **FieldNode named as primary competitor** — European, no Canadian presence, no certification layer. We differentiate on: Canada-first, certification-as-a-service, sovereign resilience.
- **Canadian Navy angle validated** — ship availability at 30–50%, target 70–80%. Dave's submarine story: 4 custom-built submarines, each different, requiring "as-built" parts for 30-year-old ships with 10 years of life left. AM solves this absurdity.
- **Referral unlocked:** Mark Philpott (LR Ottawa, naval connections)

**2. GKN Aerospace Interview (#43) — Market Scope Clarified**
Matthew Erning (GKN Technical Authority): civilian aviation production is NOT our market (planned, predictable — no digital inventory need). The real aerospace barrier is the **MMPDS material database gap**, not regulations. Defense aerospace mandates can override IP resistance. FAA PMA = aerospace equivalent of our pre-certified parts library.

**3. Equinor Interview (#44) — Strongest ROI Frame Yet**
Douglas Garcia-Golindano (26 years O&G, Equinor Midstream): *"My cost is 1–2% of total capex. If you don't have it, you lose 98% of production."* Bay du Nord ($14B, 500km offshore, FID 2027) spare parts strategy being designed NOW — greenfield opportunity to embed from day one. Equinor is already using unmanned robots + AI for parts logistics between platforms. Our pitch: *"You automate moving parts. We automate making them."*

**4. Name + Positioning Finalized**
- **Company:** AddManuChain (formerly AlmaTech)
- **Tagline:** "We end the War on Inventory"
- **Lead message:** "Breakdown insurance + working capital liberation"
- **AI = feature, not headline** (*"Don't sell the AI. Sell the solution."* — Shawn Sooley, Shield Group)

**5. Pivot Strategy Document Written (Pivot.md)**
A full 13-section document synthesizing all 46 interviews into: what changed, what was validated, what was abandoned, competitive landscape, 3-layer platform architecture (Permission / Intelligence / Network), partnership map, and Week 8 action plan.

## WHAT TO ASK DWAYNE FOR THIS WEEK

### Ask #1 — Introduction to Auker Solutions (design firms are the missing link)
> *"Last time, you mentioned Heather Davis at Auker Solutions and said she's on the digitalization team. You offered to help open that door. Could you send her a quick intro email saying I'm one of your mentees working on AddManuChain? The design firms are the ones identifying which parts are suitable for AM — that's the key node we're missing in the ecosystem."*

### Ask #2 — Equinor Bay du Nord O&M Contacts
> *"I interviewed Douglas Garcia-Golindano from Equinor last week — he's in the midstream/pipeline silo, but he said the Bay du Nord spare parts decisions are being made right now, pre-FID. The team I need is in O&M/Technology. You mentioned Brad Elliott is in their innovation space locally. Could you help me reach him, or do you know anyone in Equinor's Bay du Nord project team specifically?"*

### Ask #3 — Defense / DND Entry Point
> *"Dave Whitehouse from Lloyd's Register told me the Arctic/DND angle is the strongest lever for government funding and military procurement. He referred me to Mark Philpott (LR Ottawa). Do you have any DND, PSPC, or Irving Shipbuilding contacts who work on Canadian naval supply chain or maintenance contracts? That's the direction I'm heading next."*

### Ask #4 (Optional) — Co-Innovation Centre Network
> *"Are there any companies in the Co-Innovation Centre ecosystem working on AM, spare parts logistics, or digital supply chains for offshore or defense that I haven't talked to yet? Even a name drop in the hallway would help."*

## CONTEXT FOR DWAYNE (What He Should Know About Our Strategy)

**Our beachhead market has shifted:** From O&G operators broadly → to **Arctic/remote utilities first** (lowest certification barrier, self-certifying, highest pain per dollar), then defense/naval, then offshore O&G.

**Why this makes sense:** As Dwayne said in our Feb 3 meeting — *"You go into parts that are low risk to get people comfortable with it."* Utilities are our proof of concept market before we go to Equinor.

**Atlantic XL is now LR-certified:** This is the company Dwayne mentioned in Feb 3 as being in the Co-Innovation Centre with him. The fact that they just received the first LR facility qualification in the Americas changes everything for our near-term roadmap. We should co-develop the first certified parts library together.
