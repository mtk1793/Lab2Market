Okay yeah, so [...1.6s] great to meet you, yeah, me too as well. Thank you very much for being here with me, and thank you for accepting to be my mentor. So, yeah, we all goes well. [...1.0s] Okay, so should I start? [...1.1s]Yes, go, go ahead and, and tell me a little bit about yourself, and I'll give you a little bit about my background. Okay, for sure, uh, so my name is Bapukia Sarif.I'm a PhD student at Dalhousie University. I mean, my main major is electrical, but right now I'm in the [...0.5s] middle of program or idea about developing a project, and it's related to mechanical site.So the reason that they have this project is because rather than working on mechanical is part of, is about programming and AI. That's why this is the my major PhD work. That's why I'm involved with that.So recently we got accepted for the lap to market, and I was working with Carol. And after that, the Mary told me that obviously, we need to have a mentor to help us and guide us through this industrial section, so should I also talk about my idea or should be afterwards?Yeah, go a little bit into your idea. I know it's that predictive maintenance and all that kind of stuff that predictive maintenance into added out of the faction. So, [...0.6s] um, and then I'll give you a little bit more background so I put context to it.Fantastic because it was funny about the predictive maintenance was an idea that came up after this program to me after talking with a couple of [...0.5s] industry peoples. I found that why not try to maybe shift a little bit to see that what you can do?But, yeah, as you just mentioned, the main idea of this work is about building an ecosystem between different segments are the part of the industry that and users or whoever want to buy it, the Oems, the 3D printing facilities, the authorities and laps.So the whole idea is that try to make that playground for them in order to connect with each other as soon as possible, as fast as possible.And another part was about shifting or [...0.8s] helping these companies, most of the time the end users to try to shift from the physical inventory to digital inventory, especially after covid. Anything just, everything just happened after I talked with a couple of industries, found out, yep, that was real.Some companies are looking for that, yet it needs a couple of [...0.6s] ways to be better because of the trust and other kind of issues.And also beside all of that, I was thinking that how I can use the AI, either it could be used in the, this transition between the physical to digital or this kind of the, between this building and ecosystem. And recently I get another idea, why not try to use it for the predictive maintenance?Because that was one of the bottleneck. I found out it was a problem with so many industries. And I said that, okay, if I do have enough data and if I do have enough equipment, why not try to use the AI?Because right now AI is everywhere, but industry people either they don't know about it that much or they don't trust it. So this is the whole idea of my work. I'm still working on it. I have to some kind of put some sticks inside of that and just pull out some sticks.And [...0.8s] from that, I'm still trying to figure it out, but [...0.5s] all in all, that was the whole project itself.Yes. Yeah. No, I think, I think you're in a great program to do that, exploring, yeah you know, exploring your idea, try ground truthing it, talking to industry, but also seeing where it can lead you. And you've already started thinking about what, where could that lead you?Right? So, um, my experience, um, I didn't, I graduated from Memorial University, [...0.5s] oh, 25 years ago and I've been working in, [...0.7s] mostly in oil and gas for about 20 years, [...0.6s] always on technology development and new ways of business models and things like that [...0.7s] for the last five years [...0.5s] basically since Covid I, [...0.7s] instead of being in the [...0.8s] gas industry and looking at technology and how we can use it, I start working in the technology industry to help technology get into [...1.4s] industry excess.So, you know, a lot of it at the beginning was looking at, you know, disruptive technologies that can help push forward oil and gas.But like you know, you further explain that into when you realize that [...0.9s] a technology is an enabler, and you look at that technology as an enabling multiple industries, this is cross sectorial, right?Like you can have your pillars of industry that we all traditionally talk about, but really when you have like an added manufacturing warehouse, like additional warehouse [...0.6s] that can, that can go to any industry. You're not talking about one specific industry. It is all industries that can benefit from a type of technology like that.So I now currently work at the Co Innovation Center here in ST. John's, Newfoundland. And our [...0.5s] primary directive is to advance innovation in the primary sectors of defense, energy and mining. But really looking at [...0.6s] how do we help [...0.7s] these industries [...1.3s] adopt or adapt disruptive technology to advance their operations.So I do have experience working with [...0.6s] out of manufacturing companies, [...0.8s] companies that are looking at [...0.5s] additional warehousing, has a means, [...0.8s] um, but also had worked with companies on the predictive maintenance. And that's so my mind was there, cause I'm just usually talking about that.But that's why my thought, my thought was already is on that. It's like, oh no, that was somebody else I shouldn't talk to. But anyways, is it's all, um, it's all related, [...0.5s] um, just the, the disruptive technologies.And when you look at the definition of disruptive technologies is everything that is, [...0.7s] you know, you talk about AI and predicted maintenance and all that kind of stuff.It is [...0.8s] new, [...0.7s] it is, [...1.2s] you know, the [...1.2s] very positive [...0.5s] and really change the way you're doing business. But, [...0.5s] you know, when you're talking about these industries that have been doing it the same way and making money on it the same way for years, [...0.6s] why change?Yeah, I'm making money doing what I'm doing, [...0.6s] right? And that's why it's so why take that risk of if I go down this route [...0.8s] and have the, will I lose reliability? Do I have shutdown time that I can't manage?All these industry questions creep in that their [...1.3s] old school thinking is, [...0.7s] hmm, maybe not, [...0.6s] but [...0.5s] has we advance? Has we go through this digital revolution that were happening right now? More and more people that are used to digital solutions [...0.6s] go up the food chain in in, in a business.They're more and more [...0.5s] willing to [...0.5s] adapt [...0.5s] new technologies, so it's a, it's still a, in the traditional industries, takes time. Um, but there, [...1.3s] there's more of an appetite each year of [...0.5s] talking to people with very interesting ideas.Yeah, yeah, I completely understand it and that, that is fantastic. I mean uh, one of the things at the very beginning of the point, my main focus was [...0.5s] over just [...0.6s] having the digital inventory and some kind of trying to make an ecosystem.But a couple of days ago, actually talking with one of the industry people was that he told me that your idea is good, but right now in big industrials he was working, it's, [...0.6s] I cannot remember the company. I'm sending so many emails these days.Everything is [...0.5s] crazy right now. But he told me that in our industry, we are working with vessels, and those vessels, especially in oil and gas, they worth maybe fund 500 to 1 billion dollars. And right now we do have in physical inventory at least 50 to 60 million dollars of stock. So [...0.8s] why we should trust additive manufacturing?Why you're giving me, give, what is the thing that actually you're giving it to me?Another thing that I was came up actually was in my mind, but he answered that says that, okay, let's assume that your additive manufacturing is good at the end of the day, you're trying to reduce the downtime cost, right?We are working in oil and gas each day that you're losing because of the part takes around 500,000 to one million dollars. But we do have so many, so many huge companies that can compensate that.So we don't have that much of a problem yet on that side. Uh, he told me that why not try to use the AI inside this, some kind of, [...0.6s] uh, the company or industry itself.I said how, for example, he told me the predictive maintenance, or maybe since you, I talked about the digital inventory, told me that, okay, why not try to make, use it in our inventory rather than digital, digital or physical, and try to help us in order to see that maybe we should, uh, some kind of website.Jesus. Well, that's [...0.7s] it. It's my wife just [...0.9s] bombarding me with this some kind of PM, sorry about that at the end of the day.He gave me this idea that say, hey, I mean, try to focus maybe mostly on that area. So after talking with other industries and other some kind of parts, they were some kind of smaller companies, they told me that additive manufacturing is good. There's no some kind of debate about that.So many companies are trying to talk about it, but yet there is the trust issue. I mean, today I was talking with [...0.6s] one of the Dalhousie professors and he told me that if you would like to enter this some kind of using the additive manufacturing, you cannot sell right now, tell a big industry.Hey, give me your whole vessel. I can make it for you. Or [...0.6s] he told me something about structural part and nonstructural part. He told me that we will be for you to better focus on nonstructural part. So as you can see over here, I'm trying to connect the dots. I mean, write down just as a detective.I do have everything on the wall, trying to use their red line to connect them together. But, yeah, having someone like you that has lots of experience could help me.I mean, [...0.7s] right now I reached to how many people, maybe around 250, 300 people. I got some answers, I got some meetings. Some of them they decline me, so that makes sense. Uh, but the thing is that I'm trying to shift my focus because at the end of the day, hundred interviews matters. Yes, it's going to give me an idea, but at the end of the day, I'm trying to build this.How can I say still mind that of a real entrepreneur? It doesn't matter if I work in my project. For instance, next day if someone asks me, hey, work on this project, I would like to [...0.6s] know my path. I would like to learn my path that how I can be not the best one of the best in every kind of this category.Right now, again, the main focus is my, my project oiling gas, the idea that I have, but in the long run, I mean, [...0.9s] yeah so couple things to, you know, talking Rob says about, [...0.5s] um, you know your professor is right in where you start off on, you're trying to, [...0.8s] to do the non critical [...0.6s] elements, yes, example, so like structural to versus non structural, non critical elements because the risk is low.Yes, so, you know, there is [...0.5s] an adject manufacturing actually in my building at the Innovation Center. Um, and, you know, they're going through qualifications. You know, even though [...1.0s] out of this manufacturing is [...0.5s] depending on the market in the world. [...1.1s]It's becoming more, more common, yeah, um, [...0.6s] but in this [...1.0s] part of the world, it's still a [...1.2s] exploratory technology. [...1.1s] And, and so how do you explore that? You go into parts that are low risk [...0.5s] to get people comfortable with it.And that is designing things that are, like said non structural, noncritical, designing it, testing it [...0.7s] and what not. So [...2.2s] the local [...1.3s] Atlantic Excel is a local company here and Sean there, as [...0.6s] you know, is, is really knowledgeable on it and that [...0.8s] they have to do all these pilot projects.Even though the oil and gas companies that they're working with use out of the manufacturing in Norway and they've created the great, [...0.6s] um, network over there of using additive manufacturing here, they still have to go through pilot projects.They still have to because they are [...1.6s] training the local people [...1.0s] on using the technology, technology getting them to understand where and how to adapt that new technology. Even though has a company, a worldwide company, they use it over here [...0.6s] locally, they have to train them up.And that's the thing about oil and gas is that [...1.2s] even though it may be especially something that's physical, even though it might be something used over there, it has to be proven [...0.7s] to work here.Right? And so, uh, there are ways of, uh, building awareness, doing these pilot projects and stuff like that in order to [...0.6s] reduce the risk. And so what they're finding is, yes, this low critical or [...1.4s] product [...0.5s] components that are obsolete.So you, so you have a pump offshore, yeah, might be a 15 year old pup. Now you can go, that pup starts to fail, [...0.7s] linking into your predictive maintenance there, but starts to fail and you're like, okay, well we're gonna need a component that the bearings or whatever is starting to wear on it. [...1.4s]You go to the pump manufacture like, oh, we don't make that pump anymore, but I'll sell you a brand new one. [...1.1s]Kind of a deal and or [...1.3s] this is where active manufacturing come in. They can take that spec and they can re engineer and make that component. So instead of spending, you know, half a million dollars on a brand new pump and all the training that goes with it, you can just do it for 100 k, [...1.4s] you know, and you get that piece manufactured and tested and put offshore in a week. Right?So that's where they're, you know, out of the manufacturing and the digital warehousing components is not for everything, [...0.7s] but there is where it there is there's niches out there where, you know, you have to go to the refinery, you have to build a component from scratch and everything like that.There are things where you go to, um, [...0.6s] uh, CMC machine, and just, like, take it from a block of steel and, and mill it down, talk to you, bye.There's other areas where added manufacturing [...0.8s] can play a part, [...0.8s] right, and, and, and those pieces will be used, you know, like to re engineer something to make it more lightweight versus a heavier piece of machinery.So there are pockets where added manufacturing, hence the digital [...0.8s] thing, and then, you know, medals versus polymer as well.You can have a full warehouse looking at both components, right. So it's not out of manufacturing or advanced manufacturing is, [...0.7s] is not just metal [...0.8s] powder turning into, you can actually use polymers as well, so [...1.1s] great.So there, there's, there's different elements there. That were you where the industry has to, to learn [...0.8s] now [...0.6s] the overall long term cost savings are there.You know, [...0.5s] they they talked about on a vessel, they have spare parts, you know, because of historical speaking, [...0.7s] you know, we to reduce the risk of these parts might it takes us 6 months to a year of to order these new parts in and all that kind of stuff.So in order to reduce our risk, we'll have a warehouse [...1.1s] down by the dock, [...1.1s] you know, and these million dollar components just could just be sitting there.Yeah, [...0.6s] right, and that is the element where out of, you know, [...0.5s] where digital warehouse in can play part. It's not gonna be, [...0.8s] um, you know large pieces, large complex things like I said [...1.3s] out of the manufacturing can't do.It's not the solution for everything, but it can probably reduce [...0.9s] the size of that warehouse, three size of that footprint, the amount components that you have on the shelf.Right, [...0.5s] so you can, you can do it, so the pathways there, it is a whole bunch of learning to get there [...0.5s] and that, and that's the um, [...0.9s] that's why it's a disruptive technology.It's called disruptive because people need to be educated on it, they need to test it, they need to feel it, they smell it, you know, it's like they gotta go through that process of learning [...0.5s] and, um, acceptance, right, and it's, but it helps having, [...0.5s] um, champions [...0.7s] within that boiling gas companies to do it.Like, [...0.5s] you know you talk to Sean from Atlantic Excel, [...0.5s] uh, he's, you know, obviously he's making it. He can sell, but you have to talk to people who did, who are the designers.So if you talk to companies like Offer Solutions or, uh, award or some people like that, who [...1.0s] are the design companies for oil gas [...1.0s] and get them to talk to you about how they look at and, and [...0.9s] out of manufacturing. And there are a couple unknown locker solutions.They have a couple in house experts that when it comes to [...0.5s] their engineering, they'll help identify which ones can help [...0.7s] out of.This is better for out of the forces going to a refinery, right to, to get involved, [...0.6s] right, so having those champions and then the oil gas companies themselves or the vessel operators themselves getting to understand.Yeah, [...0.6s] so the shipyards have to understand how [...0.8s] and where do we use this thing. Because right now, it's like, oh, are you saying this out of manufacturing is gonna make all the different types of meth pieces of equipment?As, like, the answer is no, it's it, but the niche part of that full ship [...0.6s] design or full offshore red design. There are components there that are better suited for this type of machinery this type of machinery this type of machinery so it's, it's to educate which where it works.So [...1.3s] that is where the Digital Warehouse in [...0.6s] umbrella works, right. It's, it's once you [...0.6s] get all those elements in, [...0.8s] because that's who, that's who you need to partner up with.You need to partner up with the people who [...1.2s] are the buyers, [...0.7s] the people, who are the sellers, [...0.6s] and the people who are to the designers to provide input on what is the best components to go into that warehouse, exactly makes sense.Yep, I mean, thank you very much for all the thankful great information, especially you mentioned about the occur solution. Because I tried to reach a couple of those guys, but fortunately no chance. Just in, [...0.5s] just in case do you have, maybe know anyone from their company that I can contact with?I mean, in from your networking, because one thing that they found out throughout this process is that if you reach out to someone that actually know somebody from your network, it's a higher chance that they would respond to you.But, yeah, I mean if you have someone that would be perfect from there that I can contact with, yeah, I'm, uh, [...0.7s] giving you a, I'll, I'll send you an email for sure. Um, [...0.5s] uh, I accept to find it in amongst all of my stuff. Um, [...1.3s] and let me see, [...0.6s] yeah, I'll use this one here.I know one, but that's not the [...3.7s] while you are sending for that. Actually, uh, [...0.7s] on Friday, I had a meeting, I mean, online meeting with Sean, Sean Morgan and John Litsong. I talked with those two guys from Atlantic Excel. I mean, Sean was very helpful, John was as well.I mean, actually Sean, I guess [...0.5s] the one thing that you were talking about, it was about one of the project that you had before Christmas that Sean told me that one of the companies accepted that we can give them the additive manufacturing part, while they didn't have that much of a trust. And at the end of the day, the outcome fantastic, they really like it.So, yeah, he was so helpful he was so helpful in my knowledge, like, and, and that both [...0.5s] Sean and John are located in the Innovation Center, so I talked to Sean [...0.7s] a lot on this, [...0.7s] so he is very [...1.4s] knowledgeable.He's been, you know, he's been with the [...0.5s] organization for, so they adapted that technology about four years ago. And to look at it, understand it, they physically been probably working for about two years in the ecosystem.Uh, they're at a really good space now of getting some traction. Like they are finally seeing the light at the end of the, when it comes to, [...0.9s] after doing a various pilot projects, people actually going to them to get [...0.6s] parts actually made.So [...0.7s] it's a long it's a long journey and with any technology, new technology, especially a physical technology, [...0.8s] sometimes that pathway is [...1.6s] can be can be long yeah, [...0.6s] and they are, [...0.9s] um, [...4.2s] fire patrol. [...3.3s]There is Heather Davis. Uh, she works locally here at, uh, Poker Solutions here in ST. John's, Newfoundland. Uh, she's on the [...0.7s] digitalization team, so they have a department there that looks like Digital solutions and digital things. And [...1.5s] when they're talking to clients, [...0.9s] they have a [...1.2s] add enough manufacturing person as well.Okay, um, [...1.2s] I don't exactly, I've never dealt with them in person, so I would have to sort that for you. But yeah, they have, Heather will help you for sure to get the first interview and she might be able to put you on to the next person. If I can't find that email for you. Perfect.That's fantastic. So you, yeah, you just saying that I should reach out to her. I said that I was talking with Mr. Hopkins and he some kind of referred to you to me and maybe I'm, I'm working on this kind of stuff and maybe if you can help me that we can do. Yeah, yeah, makes sense.Yes, exactly, there are, there they work really, uh, they, uh, closely, like Auker works closely with uh, Atlantic Excel, um, and with, uh, oil and gas companies are looking at [...0.8s] where and how to place additive manufacture.So they do, do, um they're good insights, and like I said, they're the design of component, you know, like to excel is to the seller of it. They'll be the designers.And, um, do you have have you talked to with anyone from Ecuador? Uh, no chance, I mean, I tried to send him a couple of emails, but again that's a big company. So, [...0.8s] yeah, I know, uh, the one thing to, um, [...0.9s] because you were a [...2.1s] more or less a new entrepreneur, a slash student.They might [...1.2s] provide time for you, [...0.6s] but the [...2.3s] locally here, [...6.3s] so although [...0.7s] it's a disguise name is, no, the name is not Dell. It's Brad [...0.5s] Elliot. Okay, I'm just looking at it.No, [...0.9s] okay, yeah, it's just the way they, um, take that the first name and the first three letters of the last name, [...1.2s] Brad Elliot. Yeah, [...0.5s] okay, so he works in the technology [...0.5s] side of things, so, um, they, they [...0.5s] are the ones that help, they actually did a pilot project, Atlantic Excel.Um, [...0.9s] I'm, they, I'll put a caveat against Ecuador locally [...0.8s] is that they are going through a project [...1.1s] trying to get a project rewarded for off Jordan flannel Labrador, [...0.9s] which they are planning to make the announcement [...0.7s] either good or bad.But the announcement is coming in the next month or so. So a lot of communication has gone silent simply because they don't want to, [...0.6s] uh, [...1.6s] talk about [...0.7s] say anything that like Persuade Media or anything like that to get a hold of where the direction all of this contract award is going.So it's [...0.8s] no more problems when you talk about a 10 billion dollar project, [...1.1s] it's things go quiet [...1.0s] a few months before an announcement because if it's good or bad, they don't want to get any headbands out there.So that's just normal practice. But because this is a entrepreneurial, kind of like mentor thing they may talk to you, [...0.9s] um, Brad may talk to you on it to be very holistically, you know, how to manufacturing is big on their [...1.0s] international road map. They do it a lot in Norway. Um.They're trying to create a same ecosystem here. So holistically though, they can talk about your idea because it has no effect [...0.8s] on [...1.3s] what's going to happen in the next six months, six weeks, right?Exactly. Right. So they may talk to you, [...0.6s] uh, but don't be discouraged and anybody for Aquinar doesn't get back to you. That's why I put that [...0.7s] after the announcement and you'll see announcement. If they're talking about a 10 billion dollar project, you'll hear it. [...1.2s] After that, I'll talk to you no problems.Yeah, I get it. Actually [...0.5s] I'm not sure which project right now you're talking because I was talking with the Professor Adal and he mentioned that [...0.6s] Ecuador apparently working on a project that is so like mine. I mean, my idea, I mean, probably they're under another some kind of facet, another kind of perspective.They're working on it for a couple of years. I'm not sure. Is this the same project or it's just another project because$10 billion is not force of my project and my project is not that kind of thing. But it's, what kind of area is that project, the 10 billion one.So there, there is, they've been [...0.6s] looking at and doing engineering work on an offshore [...0.5s] oil producing platform [...0.6s] off Newfoundland, Labrador. [...1.1s] Um, so [...0.8s] it's, [...0.9s] it's been in the works for probably about 5 years.They've already had [...1.2s] a couple setbacks in where the project [...1.4s] has been never been, [...1.4s] hasn't been awarded but has been delayed um, they're still internally very optimistic about the project.It has a lot of good international, [...1.1s] you know, [...0.5s] it's a big oil field but economics and where it is and all that kind of stuff always places, [...0.5s] you know, has a 10 billion dollar project Ecuador has an international company, [...0.5s] they can, they only have so much, [...1.2s] you know, each oil company [...0.6s] basically internally has a budget each year put towards new projects.You know, it's like, like you putting some money away to go on vacation, you know, you only have so much budget each year, so where am I gonna go that year? Um, I'm not gonna take 15 [...0.9s] vacations, I'm only doing one, so where do I go?So same thing with oil companies, they only have a pocket [...0.5s] full of money that they goes, okay, we're all gonna invest in [...0.6s] one project, maybe two projects each year where we're going to commit [...0.9s] this our money, [...1.0s] so, um, [...1.1s] so that's like, so and, and, and putting into that, like where you going on vacation, what time of the year, uh, how, you know, what do I wanna see they take into considerations too. Where are the projects? What's the cost of oil? Uh, do I get? Is there a good government?And where I'm going to, to work, [...0.6s] kind of deal to light, [...0.7s] is the local workforce [...0.7s] available to so I can hire people, you know, that they call these considerations on if the project is going to be here, Brazil, [...0.8s] Norway, [...0.8s] you know, South China Sea, you know, wherever they go, but they only have so much money in their pocket to, to, to do so, [...0.5s] um, each year they go through the business seasons and so, um, it's a positive project, but they're competing with other projects [...0.6s] internally around the world. So, uh, that's why they go into silence mode around this time.This time is around this time of the year every year where they make decisions on where they're going to put their$10 billion.Okay, haha, [...0.6s] yeah, make sense, right. So that's what the project is, it's just, it's one of those things, it's, you know uh, [...0.6s] they believe in it, but it's competing internally with other projects. Like I like to go to London but also like to go to [...0.5s] Hawaii, you know, like I gotta make a choice of what one I might just end up in Pei, you know, that makes sense, right? Like, [...0.7s] right, it's just all the same thing.So, um, [...0.5s] so, but in Turk but [...1.0s] internationally, Ecuador, like I said, believes in, um, additive manufacturing. They are creating a network in Norway [...0.6s] where they [...0.6s] link [...0.6s] out of manufacturing companies, I think they're, [...0.7s] and designers and, and trying to [...0.8s] create a digital warehouse type of stuff.Like [...0.6s] the other component, there's, [...0.7s] um, Atlantic Excel is a part of out of the manufacturing worldwide network, [...0.5s] which is it does get into the digital warehousing, but it's a advantage of out of the manufacturing is being, [...0.6s] uh, [...0.8s] built [...0.6s] close to the need so you're not shipping it around the world.And so they've joined under this network where [...1.1s] if someone comes in with a need, I want this built, they'll match you with the closest [...0.9s] out of manufacturing [...0.5s] facility.Yes, so that it minimizes your, uh, you know, it'll get built the same amount of time it just minimizes the trial, the distance that has to travel once it leaves the, the building.Right, yeah, yeah, so there are these different networks that are being thing, but Ecuador is trying to create a system over Norway because they're starting to use it more frequently.And they would [...0.8s] look at the same thing that, um, [...0.7s] here locally with, in partnership with OCR, in partnership with Atlantic Excel and um and whatever else happens in Atlantic Canada.So for their operations offshore, they can have a really reliable networking, official warehouse or whatever may come [...0.8s] layered on top of that, right, yeah, make sense, make sense. Thank you very much.So I decided a third name there. Yeah, um, [...0.6s] he's as, but he works for Exxon, um Exxon Mobile or so locally, um, he's in there, um, innovation space here in ST John's. Um, he's a good person to talk to about out of manufacturing [...0.8s] and additional warehouseing.He, he is [...0.9s] through his company, they've in, are investing in Memorial University of creating research into additive benefaction.Okay, [...0.7s] perfect. Yeah, lots and lots of networking and people. So I just going to probably after, uh, this meeting, I, they probably going to reach out to them and some kind of, would I be okay if I see you in the emails or say that, yes, just you [...0.5s] show that that is where we got the contact.Yeah, yeah, yeah, hopefully, hopefully I'll open some doors for you. Yeah, we'll try again next week. Yeah, hopefully, I mean, last night I was talking with John. I mean, uh, he probably couldn't answer all of my question because part of my question was, uh, the [...0.5s] working with Atlantic Excel and NRC.So obviously, not all the information can be disclosed. There are confidential, so [...0.5s] reaching out to them is one problem, getting information from them is another problem. So I have to deal with all of that, but at this, I do have some leads and I can see what would happen [...0.6s] in the future.I see that. Okay, we do, we would like your idea or we don't so shift it to AI, do another, yeah, that's the thing you had [...0.5s] locally. You got [...0.6s] Lentic Excel which is the seller, [...0.6s] um, and Heather Davis from aukers and designer, and you have Brad and Tyler who are [...0.9s] buyers.Right, so it's, you're, you're creating that, and you'll get different perspectives on what, how additional warehouse [...0.8s] can work.Yeah, yeah, fantastic, yeah, yeah, that would be great perfect, and that's within the oil and gas space. And then we can, you know, as we go along, we can talk about other spaces, because like I said, technology is [...0.6s] non sectorial, right, it can go into different.I know you're looking at from an energy space, but from a business case perspective, [...0.9s] um, you could see where it can, you know, like, you're talking about vessels, then you're talking about ocean vessels, and you're talking about fish leaves. You, you can [...0.8s] draw down the lines to other industries and other customers.Yep. I mean, because it was, since you mentioned that about different kind of sectors, I was talking with Sean and he told me that right now they do have different kind of [...0.9s] areas that they're working on.The am just came up recently and are to therefore up that, I'm sorry, uh, the couple of years. And also he mentioned that apparently Atlantic Excel working on, uh, electrical port as well.I mean, I can't remember what he said, but [...1.4s] the try to come up with something since my background is electrical, [...0.5s] I was also thinking that, okay, try. Why try only focus on some kind of usage of additive manufacturing and oil and gas, why not try to maybe shift that to another kind of industries?Again, obviously, when you don't have any parts, that part necessarily is not looking what kind of industrial you're in, it could be some kind of damage anywhere, right? I mean, since I do have some knowledge in that area.Do you also think that at this point [...0.5s] I should mainly fit and mainly put my focus on oil and gas and energy sector or no? I can just [...0.6s] open up some branches to, you know, some kind of, yeah, different kind of areas and see that maybe I can have some chances over there. What do you think?I, I, you know, I think for success, um, you know, you're creating a platform for digital warehousing yeah and, um, that is, that's non sectorial, [...0.7s] and you, you, you look at it and probably got your your first idea has going into oil and gas to help save underwear house cost when everything like that. But I put the name here, Poly Unity.Okay, they're in actually a med tech company. Okay, [...0.5s] so just Google them. Poly Unity, [...0.8s] they do, [...2.1s] they use [...0.6s] polymer 3D printing, but they do it for hospice, oh, interesting. So they, they, they're actually now, you know, they, they used to [...0.7s] know there are relatively small, [...0.7s] uh, tech company.They, but they operate in four or five different hospitals all the way from [...0.9s] here up to Ottawa. Connamedia, they're trying to get into the, [...0.6s] to the US. Um, [...1.1s] they're also looking to understand the idea of a digital warehouse.Okay, so, you know, initially over the last five years, you know that's around about five year old company, they talked about, you know, these one off projects where they, [...0.6s] they really got their acceleration from Covid where [...0.5s] trying to get supplies was difficult. So they, that's where the hospitals really, [...0.5s] oh, I understand what you're doing.I can make face masks [...1.0s] here in my house and print them off to you instead of ordering from China or some place like that. It's like, yeah, so, yeah, I can print a face mask for you. And then they start printing off, you know, like test tube [...0.5s] holders. But then they, they really expand and doing a lot of these one offs.But now, you know, just recently, they're, they're looking at changing their pitch of, like, we are Digital Warehouse. We've been making all these things now for five years. We actually have a database [...0.5s] of medical equipment.Okay, why don't you just look on our, look on our catalogue and order a piece right, so there they, they don't, they don't have, you know, [...0.7s] they don't have a platform for it or anything like that but that's something that they're thinking about is [...0.7s] selling themselves as a digital warehouse.We have all these components, you just have to call us up, so that's then thinking about it, [...0.7s] you know, [...0.8s] I talked to them back in November, I think it was [...0.7s] October, so that's something that they're thinking about, you know, so they're not quite there yet.So that's a mid tech, and that's just using polymer, but they're, they can probably give you insight on, you know, the digital warehouse component still added a manufacturing but just using polymer versus metal. And it's for, [...0.5s] for hospitals versus offshore.So [...0.6s] use that has to explore, like, where it can go, because when you talk about additive manufacturion, you talk about in the chemical components.Yes, [...0.8s] and, and, and that's what [...0.8s] metal [...0.9s] with polymer. Now you're looking at that low risk components, so you don't need a metal [...0.6s] tray for, for, like, a [...1.2s] running wires in your boat.Usually it's a, it's a, it's a conduit tray. It's usually made out of metal why not just save some weight and print it off? And polymer, it's low risk, [...0.8s] you know, it's polymers at for holding up wires. Yeah you don't need, you don't need metal. Okay, what? So print it off in polymer, like, so that's where 3D printing can really show the advantage, and you can do it [...1.6s] locally versus [...0.9s] hiring someone buying these parts that were manufactured up in Ontario or something like that. You can just [...1.0s] dude down the street.Yeah, that's fantastic, and in this company that you just mentioned, so, yeah, you thought you told me that you talked about him last year.Do you know anyone from their company that any contact that I can say that? Hey, I got this from [...0.5s] Sir Hopkinson. Yeah, let me, [...0.7s] yeah, [...0.7s] let me just there said [...1.5s] there's three people that are head.We might be able to find our contact information on our website unless you are here. I'll be even though happy birthday. That's fine. That's okay. No, no, I just got, [...24.0s] yeah, [...0.7s] okay, [...0.5s] cool, yeah, just talk to him realistically about you know, you know, what your plan is.And, you know yes you're looking for an energy, but trying to understand the whole, [...0.8s] cause Poly Unity and Electric Excel actually talk a lot. Because they're both in advance manufacturing out of the manufacturing, right.So they, even though they use different materials, there's still trying to sell it the same way, right. You're trying to replace the old way of doing things with the new way of doing things, right, so, yeah, a lot, and that's the thing about, [...1.1s] um, what we got into.The cross section is the same challenges [...0.5s] and same, you know, [...0.6s] why change something that you're, that's been successful doing it somewhere else.Yes, all the, [...0.9s] you can, you can sell it on, saves your money saves your time, and all that kind of stuff was like, yeah, but I'm making money doing what I'm doing now. And if I change it, [...1.1s] well, like, will it cause me downtime?Yeah, like, so [...0.6s] hospitals no different than oil and gas if I shut down an operating room for a day, you know, like, bad news bears, right, [...0.5s] yeah, yeah, I do if I, if I shut down my offshore rig, I'm not pumping on any oil.I'm losing millions of dollars [...0.5s] exactly right. I'm not saving, yeah, right, so [...0.9s] it [...1.5s] ultimately when you know your technology, and, you know that doesn't happen, because [...0.6s] you know best ways to engineer around it.Because you're not stopping a production to replace itself. And you are [...0.8s] just, you just doing it faster than ordering it you know off of Amazon. [...1.5s] I can get it to you [...0.5s] locally, right, as a locally made solution. I, you can come down watch it being built.You know, [...2.1s] what important thing you mentioned actually was that that guy from the industrial told me that [...1.0s] if you, if you would like us to buy a technology, [...0.5s] you cannot just come over here.Tell us that, okay, I do have a technology, let me test it over here. No, you have to build it somewhere else test it. I mean, you are at the final, final stage, then you can come to us and say that, hey, I do have the proven technology, I just tested a couple of places now buy from me.So it means that if I still come up with the idea, I have to just invest maybe a couple of years on that to see that what would happen if I use it in [...0.5s] the low risk structural departments, right? Not rather than just moving to the exomobile and oil and gas that hey, I do have a project. I said, okay, that's good.But what is the proof? I mean, what a great day they love, they love talking about, [...0.7s] um, you know, words like dual use. So where was it used in a commercial sense [...0.5s] versus my industry? And, [...0.6s] um, who were the first adopt, adopters? Right?So, like, [...0.5s] uh, in lot of the cases, you know, they might from a research and development side of things, might invest into it for a pilot projects, but they really don't wanna use it first in an operational sense. Yeah, yeah, make sense.Right. So, but if you, so when you're looking at out of the manufacturing in the vessels, for example, talking to a local [...0.5s] vessel operator [...0.6s] that is, you know, I think in the [...0.9s] leeway, I think operates out of Halifax, [...0.7s] um, you know, um, you know, companies like that, that even even like the local, the fairity that goes across the harbor.You know, talking to them about it, right, they might be able, because there are a little bit lower risk of, you know, [...0.7s] they're not big international companies.Yeah, uh, they take a little bit more higher risk on if you sell them on, and they might be the first adapters, because, oh, you can save me money, [...1.4s] um, cause they, they go, they, they, they live on their dollars and cents right if I can save you money, I'll, I'll, I'll do it, right.Uh huh, yeah, yeah I guess, and so talking to some of those, those players on the vessel side things, and then [...0.7s] get them in and have a part built for them. [...1.5s]And then, then you go to the big internationals, and say, look, these local companies are using these exactly same part that I'm selling to you, and it's been on their ship for two years without failure.Okay, yeah, right, and these were the cost savings, less reduction in cost reduction, because you have all that database, because it's been used, right, yes, so same thing with, like, you know, I know we're talking about advice, but like you're talking about [...1.5s] the digital warehouse.Yeah, but how, so you guys show how that digital warehouse [...0.8s] play an important role in that, right, [...0.5s] make sense, make up this sense, perfect, perfect.Okay, I have lots of information I have to support to do a lot of surgeons reaching out to too many people. Thank you very much for giving me this information, that's fantastic.No, that's, that's great, so I know through this program because I've been a mentor before. It's best setting up a weekly, right, [...0.8s] yeah, yeah, so water, water, [...0.6s] um, you know, I'll let you set up, is your is your job, is your [...0.5s] company, so you'll set up that thing, but what days would you like? And I'll show you my availability.Uh, be honest with you, uh, [...0.5s] I'm trying to think about it because my schedule is, oh my God, it's everywhere, I mean, I have to schedule so many meetings, but what are your available, these at the current moment?I mean, mostly, [...1.2s] well, [...0.6s] usually [...0.6s] the afternoons are a lot more free. I usually have a lot of my meetings in the mornings, okay, that's good, [...1.3s] and [...0.8s] typically Mondays and [...2.5s] Thursday afternoons [...0.5s] is primarily my freest.Monday afternoon is fantastic because, you know, Thursday afternoons I do have discount class that we do have for for around, for 5 hours, so this is completely booked. Monday afternoon is fantastic for me, yeah, that, that's good, that's good. Alright, then send out a as long as it's before 4 Newfoundland time.So what 3:30 your time? It's okay before 3:30 your time, before 3:30 of Halifax. Yeah, okay, [...0.7s] yeah, [...0.6s] I gotta at 4:00, I gotta go and pick up my kids.Yeah, that makes sense, probably. Uh, so for sure, uh, I will send it to you for the next week, right, yeah, and I'll just make it, make it a weekly for alteration of crap that's good that's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I complicated.Okay perfect. Thank you, thank you very much, really appreciate for the help, [...0.6s] yeah, from the other city. [...352.7s] Okay, that will be good. [...1.6s] Okay, I, I can help with that.Hey, wait, [...0.6s] Faye, Faye probably knows almost people who doing the wireless power, so he probably, [...2.2s] yeah, I can look at it too. I'm looking for MTT website, so, yeah, but of science, so it's too busy to manage society. They [...0.8s] contribute the most.So [...0.6s] okay, [...0.9s] alright, uh, special sessions, I mean, we, [...0.6s] we are, we basically reuse the special sessions from last time. I haven't looked, maybe fair you did like in EDAs, how many people selected which session?No, I didn't notice as well. Yeah, okay, but I mean, it's under control [...1.5s] then. Once once, I mean the special session, it says so, right, right yeah, and then they, they would have submitted the paper, so we basically approved it. [...1.6s]And then, yeah, the actual composition of the session will depend on, you know, if those papers are, are accepted cause they still have to go through the regular peer review. Yeah, um, okay, student design competition, I think we were yeah seem to be in good shape. Yeah, nine to 10 [...1.0s] teams and, yeah, they're gonna be good shape. Yeah, [...0.6s] and we have something fun to support.What is your plan for? I mean, in Rome, they had actual, you know, the equipment, the hardware. Are you gonna be able to lend out some equipment or expect them to bring everything? [...2.3s] It's probably depends on what they want. Probably if they want net 1 lighters, then probably I only have one or two.So, [...0.9s] um, I don't think they need the mentalizer. They probably just need a power supply and then the, [...1.0s] because it's all DC to DC, right, eventually [...0.6s] all of the final measurements DC. So that's why it, while his power sometimes measurement are simple.Okay, [...0.8s] alright, anyway I mean, it seems to be under control, so that's good. Yeah, uh, [...0.6s] so idealia, [...0.5s] she should plan a budget and communicate that to Kevin.But we do have time. So publicity, [...0.8s] yeah, as I said, like our website, I'm a little worried that it doesn't, you know, it's not too inviting to industry but any any other comments on publicity. [...1.2s] I think Muhammad the asset sent you, uh, some photos.Oh, yeah, you said you will discuss it with us, yeah, [...0.7s] and [...0.9s] I, maybe I could pull it up if anyone else has any comments. The photo we have is last year, so it's, yeah, it was a collage, but I don't know, I didn't like it that much. [...1.9s] That's why I [...0.6s] didn't have a chance.But most these, [...0.5s] these days, very important I found, [...0.6s] because of the young people are most on the social media. So whenever we take events, attend the event to take more photos.So I, I, I actually not used to it [...0.9s] myself, is not used to the take photos of. And [...0.8s] I should get a lot of photos, didn't take. Yeah, no, nono
