## Notes for Presentation Delivery:

### Slide Timing (60-minute meeting):
- **Slides 1-3** (5 min): Problem, journey overview
- **Slides 4-6** (10 min): Top hypotheses, quantitative data, Arctic beachhead
- **Slides 7-9** (10 min): Certification, AI integration, customer segmentation
- **Slides 10-12** (10 min): Network map, use cases, on-site fabrication
- **Slides 13-14** (10 min): Value proposition evolution, strategic roadmap
- **Slide 15** (5 min): Key takeaways, the ask
- **Q&A** (10 min): Discussion, feedback, guidance

### Key Points to Emphasize:
1. **Quantitative validation**: $4-5M inventory for $50M utility (Adam Chubbs)
2. **Network unlocked**: Poly Unity, Kraken Robotics, Engineered Intelligence
3. **Certification barrier lower**: Utilities self-certify
4. **AI differentiator**: Engineered Intelligence partnership
5. **Beachhead clarity**: Arctic/remote operations (Defense, utilities, marine R&D)

### Questions to Ask Dwane:
1. Are we prioritizing the right partnerships (Poly Unity, Engineered Intelligence, Kraken)?
2. Should we pursue government funding (ERINL, Navy) before or after pilot?
3. Do you have introductions to Canadian Navy/DND, offshore operators, or Arctic utilities?
4. How should we position vs. Poly Unity (collaboration vs. competition)?
5. What's missing from our strategic roadmap?
