**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Attendee:** Dwane Hokins (Mentor)
**Attendee:** Mahmoud (Michael) Kiasari

**Speaker 1 (Dwane):** Always great to send you an email. I thought you would forgot that forgot that.

**Speaker 2 (Michael):** No, I'm just trying to, you know, took an effort come into this. We got phone booths and around our working space. We have a quiet area. So just getting set up

**Speaker 1 (Dwane):** They'll get perfect perfect. Actually, I was just talking with Mr. Paulin. I mean and he told me that I can contact with you because I was talking with him about some kind of the additive manufacturing and really printing, etc. And he mentioned your name and also mentioned Mr. Finn Dave Finn. I guess I mean I also contacted Dave Finn. But apparently he is very busy with this upcoming conference that is happening, so he couldn't some kind of answer me yet. But hopefully I can't reach out to him to see what's going on. But yeah, I mean Pretty easy weeks to be honest, I mean I every day I have to send at least 10-20 emails LinkedIn messages answering some kind of different kind of putting the schedules and having at least 2 or 3 meeting each day. It's pretty much right now.

**Speaker 2 (Dwane - Wait, check speakers):** That's the thing about the labs to market. It's getting you out of your comfort zone of doing these cold calls. But enhancing your sales ability, really right. And also, it's not just a sale, but it also, you know, the whole point is to refine your business model. So what is, you know what you're trying to sell, make these interviews so that you haven't really understanding of what is the challenge?

**Speaker 1 (Michael - Wait, seems reversed in transcript):** This Des. (Likely "Yes")

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Right has, you know, coming from academia a lot of The Times your looking opportunities, but sometimes the challenges are not as big has. Denmark has yet as you might imagine, right? So you're looking at Writing like it, you know I have the perfect solution.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Yeah

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** The challenge is not big enough for people to pay for that solution is like we can just deal with it as before, right? Another times they, because you're a disruptor an additive manufacturing falls under that is that they don't necessarily understand the benefits of what you're trying to do. So that's why it's really good to have these conversations in different levels of communication, not just the problem solvers, but you know, but other solution providers.

*(Clarification: Based on context, Speaker 1 is clearly Michael explaining his schedule, and Speaker 2 is Dwane mentoring him. The transcript reversed the labels initially or context suggests Speaker 1 is Michael and Speaker 2 is Dwane for most of it, let's re-read carefully)*

*Wait, earlier transcript:*
*Speaker 1: I was just talking with Mr. Paulin...* -> This is Michael.
*Speaker 2: That's the thing about labs to market...* -> This is Dwane.

*So Speaker 1 = Michael, Speaker 2 = Dwane.*

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** The company makes sense. I mean, at the beginning of the point I had an idea. I had to I thought it was the perfect solution. But after talk with around right now, it's around 30 people I mean, just talking with them, I found out no, maybe my solution is not fit for this part. At least maybe not all of it part of it. So that's why I had to pivot a little bit. Maybe change my end goal to the industries that I was going to talk with. And so having this some kind of conversation giving me so much great idea. And also yesterday I was talking with a company. I don't know how you heard about it or not. The Assembly studio, so they are based in PEI. And I found out they are doing the same somehow part of it is the thing that we are doing so we had a meeting yesterday, me and my boss and their team. We had a meeting so wasn't that bad. But I thought they didn't have that much of enough knowledge like we did so because talking with different industries with different peoples gave me so much knowledge right now. And I think I do have enough confidence to just enter the room and say that this is my pitch, and I do have enough knowledge to say that no, that's wrong. Now that is right. This is the area something like this. I'm still working on it. Hopefully, I can reach 200. That's a lot but working on it. But yeah?

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Yeah, I know. It's it's very, very ambitious, but, you know, it's, you know, it's To me, it's like it's like family feud, right if you, if you talk to a 100 people. The real challenges and opportunities will float to the top as enough people will say it right makes sense. If you only talk to 10 people, you might get 10 completely different answers, but you've talked to a 100, you'll really see the challenges and opportunities really float to us. People will be repeating themselves. And that's why 100 is a nice number. Nice easy word to target right? Yeah, well, that's it's a nice round number, but When we're talking about our ecosystem Finding a 100 people to talk to and just lend to Canada is good difficult. So that's why, in certain areas like, you know, using LinkedIn to reach out to where, at the manufacturing is more prominent, right? There are areas around the world and in different industries that use it more predominantly right? So you know what I mentioned before that, the additive manufacturing network, where people different additive manufacturing companies tie into this network, so that someone wants something printed, they go to the network and they'll go to the local manufacturing plants. Entity, that's closest to that word. So talking to other knowing that getting into that network and now you can go around the world and get interviews with people, you know, like, because they'll have different areas where they're specially. In, you know, there's aerospace is more predominantly uses than oil and gas. You know, like, but in oil and gas, there's still pockets. Like Norway is really investigating it to get in the conversations over there Vs conversations in Houston, because Houston don't necessarily use it yet, right? So it's like it's finding industries, the networks and stuff like that to expand so that like it like If you'll get those 100 interviews but might be coming from different regions. Because the smartest person is not in and lead to Canada, they might be somewhere else, right?

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Yeah, it makes sense. The economy makes sense and so you mentioned about the aerospace. I was talking with Mr. Dwane, I guess if I pronounce it rate. So he introduced me to 2 companies that they're working in spacecraft and spaceship, something like this. I kind of remember. What was it one of them was Galaxy? Xl? I guess Galaxy sorry so bad with the names. But I'm trying to talk with them to see that. Because The thing that I did for past interviews was try to reach to other industries rather than oil and gas. Because I really want to see that what is happening outside of that area. Yes, our main focus should be offshores and oil. And gas, but I really want to see what was happening. So for example, I was talking with the guy that working in the pipelines, another one was working in some kind of my field with some other electric engineering, which was energy concept. I talked with a couple of people that still additive manufacturing is there. I mean they know about that. But one thing that I found out is that they also would like to invest in this kind of projects...

**Speaker 2 (Dwane)**: ...So locally here, there's a Genesis Center. It's an incubator for companies. Genesis genesis center. They have they have 2 main programs, evolution and enterprise. I think it's the enterprise one where they help you to you go in for a couple months and they help you to Build your MVP. Plant and the other one is okay. You've already got something and you're starting to sell, and so then that the other one is for that one, that program. So that's a local in St. John's Newfoundland in cabaret. I would assume that there's something similar in Halifax area. Probably yeah. Right? So look at Volta is Is one organization there? You could also reach out to Digital Nova Scotia. There are an entity organization. They don't provide funding, but they can help you point you in the right direction on getting that type of where in Nova Scotia can you abide by that type of stuff sitting down with? Looking at their IRAP or your NSERC kind of a funding agencies, they're, you know, you've probably worked with them already in your PhD, or whatever. Like they are good to sit down and they can help you. Point you in the right direction. Also on some of these Government funding funding opportunities. The price tells the God, the governments are really good and On your TRLs to 1 to 15 dirt on panabeal. There's always this gap between 4-5 to 7. That is troublesome held the **Valley of Death** or on your entrepreneurial life cycle. And then the federal government comes in again of around 7 or 8 to help you with your commercialization kind of deal. But there'll always this well from MVP to, you know, trying to develop that to commercialization. There are a lack, but there's other entities out there like the Genesis Center or things like that. That can help you. So I would recommend you to reach out to your local organizations first, Digital Nova Scotia, that could help you locally on that Avenue, right? Like, even the like, has this labs to market is one of those federal programs to help you? Hey, an idea and shape it and moving. You in the right direction, right? And that's what these programs are meant to do is to help the entrepreneurs, right? So I'm in In the at the Memorial University, they also have what's called an MCE is a Memorial Centre of Entrepreneurship as well as a design hub that are tooled to help students that are currently in the university on some of that path forward. Check within DAL if they have similar entrepreneurial type of supports. Because they will also help you direct you to where the best funding is go to.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Yeah, we do have something that you just mentioned hop. We do have IdeaHUB. We also do have that over here. I mean, I still haven't talked with those guys yet. I mean

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** But like you said you were at that point now where you're starting to really shape your pitch of your idea right? And this program will help Massage that cause you are going to talk to a lot of people. And you are going to get your messaging, correct, you're going to get, you're gonna see quite clearly the challenge. And the opportunity for your solution. So it'll be because that'll be clear. It will be very much clear to the under on what they're funding.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Yeah, I'm right, exactly complex says I mean So yesterday as I told you we had a meeting with some kind of that company we were thinking about having the partnership together. So I was so excited about that, I went there. I tried to talk with them. My boss also were there. So my boss, the actual, I guess for my boss. So he's working, I mean, he has a company in Ottawa. He's all working with us. That is in 30 printing and additive manufacturing. So I found out that the company that we have. We are going to have a partnership as I just told you they were not very ahead of us but one important thing. That I liked it was about how my boss liked the pitch that I had, because before that one I mean I didn't have that much of a courage and confidence in order to talk about my idea, or at least about the information that is moving around it. So it some kind of gave me a signal that I'm in the right path, because it is very important, not just people telling you that okay, you're doing a great job. You also have yourself to understand that okay. I'm doing something over here. And I was just also comparing myself from before Lab2Market and we just hear for around the month right. Just around the month we started at last month. Yeah, so I really like that. I really like this leveling up as you just mentioned. I'm trying to work on my message. I'm trying to make it better and better at the beginning of the beginning of the I was talking about only ecosystem of different entities. Then, I talk about digital inventory. Then, I'm talking about the AI, but right now I'm trying to find It balance between all of them to reach to one person and say that. Hey, this is my idea you like it or not. But yeah, I mean, I'm getting there. I'm getting there and I'm happy with this pace. Also, Carol is so helpful, Randy and other people there. They are super helpful every week. We do have this kind of course. And we also, last week, we had this guy. Last week we had this meeting with other people in our team. We do have six people in the team Carol as facilitator so it was fantastic. It was fantastic. I mean, we just sharing in ideas. And I really like this program. Yeah, I mean, I Yeah, I think he's good everything I have to say is good, so do you have some kind of ideas that who I have to reach out to right now? I mean, who do you think I should talk with more?

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Well, you mentioned. You know, getting these certified and everything like that. Have you reached out to these certification societies to understand their path of

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Acceptance, I talked with I'm not sure if I talked or not. There's so many names in my head right now. I really would like to talk with Lloyd's probably probably probably this is my next some kind of path. Hopefully I can find those guys, but yeah, my next path will be about that by any chance do you know anyone from DNV or Lloyd's Register that maybe you can connect me to.

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Just searching it up. So I put in the chat a Trevor Butler. He's a local Lloyd's Register here in St. John's. He threw their organization that Atlantic XL got certified. Okay so he will be able to provide you with some good insights on the certification process. And what is needed and why it's needed kind of a deal. So if you're creating a digital inventory and stuff like that, you only want companies In your inventory that are capable, you know, not just say they can do it, but prove they can do it. That's what the certification society provides that level to the customer. That what I'm getting from this supplier. Scott seal of approval. So Trevor here is like I said the local one that worked with Atlantic xl and getting their middle certification done so he can talk about that process and why it's important all that kind of stuff. He has I think he has a person in Nova Scotia. I can't remember her name. That is also an expert on got knowledge in this field. Right, so but reach out to Trevor he works with entrepreneurs and stuff like that. So You know, talk about other areas of funding and stuff like that, when you do have an MVP. And things like that Lloyd's register also has sort of like accelerators, and if you overlooked at accelerators, that's another Avenue of taking your MVP. And The accelerators are all over the world. They can be they basically. You come in with your MVP, and they over like a 6 week program, will give you a lot of mentors. A lot of business supports a lot of introductions to accelerate your sales. It's called Lloyd's Register Safety Accelerator. So there's all over the world. Some of them are funded by Corporations, some of them are funded by Governments, but anyways, Lloyd's has an internal accelerator where they take technology and And work them sometimes is for their benefits. Sometimes it's to be, you know. When mutual beneficial kind of deal

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Yeah, it makes sense. Okay well.

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Anyways, that's a side story. It's not why you're going to talk to Lloyd's lloyd's all about the process of that certification. Of events manufact.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, I will reach out to them. Yeah, I mean, do you have time? I have one question yogurt. So yeah, yesterday I was talking with one of my professors at Dalhousie, and I heard about that, I don't know, have you heard about the new project that Equinor is working on, Bay du Nord project, apparently it's a very big project and I was also talking with Mr. Paulin about that. They're still at the researching phase. I mean, they're working on it right now. It's not official maybe yet, but they're still working on it. Apparently, it's a very, very big one. We're talking about $10 billion. And yesterday I was also talking with one of my professors, and I told him that, okay, I'm working in Lab2Market this kind of things. And he told me a very funny, interesting story that the day before that on Monday, we had some visitors from the navy, and they came up to Dalhousie to check out collapse, to see that water the facilities do we have apparently, they also do have some project big projects big pockets? So my Prof. was hopeful that we could get that one, but he didn't know, because apparently we do have different kind of competition, and also we do have the US from ourselves. But what do you think about defense and navy project? Because I talk with one guy, Mr. Lee Vessey. I cannot remember the name, but he was from Thales (Talas), and he told me that they also would like to invest in this kind of project and they say that, okay, if your project worthfully enough, if you do have a good proposal, we are going to put one adj in the R project and federal funding. Is going to be another 180 kJ? So we do have 360K right now and we are going to invest on that. So I also I was also talking with Mr. DeFalco from NGen. He also told me that apparently Canada would like to have this sort of platform for itself. Because funny story a few days ago I was talking with the company with the name of Wolf wooth something like that. It was in Europe and at the end of the conversation I found that they are doing the exact same idea that I do have. But in Europe and it was funny and one thing I found out is that they still haven't touched the Canada market yet. They're still working on it. And so I found that this working this idea on digital inventory and having this all sort of thing, it would be a very, very great opportunity, and it's just a matter of time right now, because I have to be fast rather than that. I'm going to lose the market to other competitors, or maybe other people from Europe. Europe is so advanced in these kind of things. But do you think focusing also on navy and defense would be also a good thing, or no, they are so tall off to pass through

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Well yeah. So okay. Where do I start? So the defense within Canada, and I guess NATO countries in general the world as we see it is a little bit influx. So Military spend is going up all over the world. Because of uncertain geopolitical times And Canada, which heavily relied on a neighbor for I can't rely on them. Has confidently has before, so they are actually It's going to be doubling tripling their spending on defense. And you know, per year kind of deal. So like what they normally spend or tripling that into to a new normal? And part of that is Increasing under digital technology. So they're coming out quite soon on a digital integration strategy where they'll highlight these type of technologies that they are working on. And highlighting what they're going to, so what you've been saying of something them investing into additional inventory is probably a long vowel's lines, right? So they're going into that digital space, and how do you work with it? The way the defense works is via their contractors. So like Thales, who's a prime contractor's Avenue to get into because they'll do a lot of the investigations and stuff. So In investigation, so they will look at more of the they have pilot projects that they can work with with the lower TRL level companies, right. The defense company has a whole They look at what we classify as dual use technology, where it is where it is already working in another environment, so all they have to do is adapt it. And that's where they can expediate technology adoption in the defense. Because the defense has historically slow in adoption. Especially the Canadian defense, it could take 3 to 5 years of entry. So if you have something that's working somewhere else, it shortens that time period of the acceptance, they still have to go through their own certification and everything like that, to make it government grade defense grade. But it shortens the time if you already working. But through prime contractors, they can help accelerate that entry. So Thales typically works with, you know, another avenues. They work heavily with COVE. It's a COVE (Center for Ocean Ventures & Entrepreneurship). So Thales worked with them because Thales works, basically. They got the contracts for the vessels. You know, it's one Avenue of the defense... land air water... so Thales is one of the prime contractors on the water side things so they work heavily with COVE on investigating on track entrepreneurs and technology. For chips, but Like I said, their main, their main goal is keep the boats operating out at sea as long as possible. So if technologies and digital inventory that you're able to get apart quickly out there, you're meeting one of the criteria. And like you said, you talked to Thales, there's avenues of taking your idea maturing it time video. So the defense is an excellent opportunity. Most tech companies are looking at that Avenue because all the announcement that they're going to spend heavily on technology over the next few years to enhance defense, they're going to expediate entry points. So any new disruptive technology is going to get a really good lens on it. Because like you said, if there's ways that they can keep them operating at reduce costs, they're going to look at them. You have perfect rates on your pitch on that is very valid, 122 in part of that defense. So yeah, it's a very good opportunity that you gotta make sure your pitch your low TRL level. So you gotta look at avenues of All through Thales, or through COVE to help you get entry points.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** It makes sense, and what do you think about Equinor? Because today the reason I ask about that project is that today I do have a meeting with one of the people in the Equinor. I mean, I was so lucky to found them. It was so hard, apparently they're so busy these days, but from different big diets...

...

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Equinor in Norway, set up a huge digital inventory in Norway. So Equinor is one of the leaders they worked closely with FieldNode and AM companies to create a network, they poured a lot of money into it to To see that. And then it's growing because other industries are now coming in, but Equinor started it. They saw the value of it, and they invested in it into the designers into the manufacturing companies. But now it's growing legs into other industries because they're coming large, self sustained, but they help seed it in the first few years, because they needed that The first couple of years were always curious, right? So and curious, so Equinor here they're waiting on The announcement for Bay du Nord, which is going to happen over the next couple of months, and when they back announcement happens if it is a positive that they're going to go forward with Bay du Nord, they will be investing on digital technologies. So having an ear with Equinor on these type of things and knowing that They do use that type technology in Norway's very effectively. It's a good conversation to have. At this stage, because it's really it's really early days for them here on building up, Bay du Nord project, because even though it's a $10 billion project, it's going to take them 10 years of designing and building before it gets in the water right.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Exactly. Yeah, hopefully I can't find a place in that one to get some idea that what's going on with them, because there are big names, big names, and as you just mentioned, not just Equinor, but I guess all of the companies in Europe, they had so much experience in this same kind of area and the one thing that I found out is about the trust and apparently these companies that moving forward to digital inventory. They had so much great connection with other companies. For example, add or 90 years of connections with other parts, and after that, they shift towards the digital inventory. That's a rough path. But yeah, I'm still working on it to see what's going on.

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Yeah, at the end of the day, your platform right? Yeah, so you're still platform between a buyer and a seller. Exactly. So you don't have to have those long-term relationships. You just have to have a trusted platform.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Yes, that's the trustees issue. Yeah, that's the one I would work on it.

**Speaker 2 (Dwane):** Yeah, all right. I got

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah, see ya take care bye.
