Hello, [...0.5s] hello, how are you? I'm not too bad yourself. Thank you, thank you very much, really appreciate for being here today with me. [...1.4s] Yeah, no problem.Well, you know, you guys are kind of makes members, so always happy to [...1.3s] sit in with you guys. And [...0.7s] I know universes are big, lots of things going on and [...1.0s] Dollhouse is particularly interesting.Yeah, thank you very much appreciate it. So [...0.6s] let me just start a little bit of [...0.7s] introduction for myself. As I just mentioned in the email, my name is Matt Mckieosrie.Currently I'm doing my PhD at Dalhoushu University. So recently we are [...0.5s] in the program that we call it as a lap to market. And this program they are trying to help us as some kind of so called new entrepreneur in order to convert the ideas right now, which is a raw idea by validating, uh, among different kind of industry partners or some kind of experts like you.I have to do at least 100 TV, 100 interviews in order to make sure that my work or some kind of my idea is going to be [...0.5s] acceptable for the some kind of market or not.That's why I reached out to you and some kind of, I would like to know [...0.6s] your idea, to your idea towards my work by asking a couple of questions. By the way, just before we start this interview, would that be okay if I record this one just for the reception?Yeah yeah, thank you very much. So before I ask my questions about [...0.6s] some kind of my work which is related to this laptop market, could I have a little bit of inter, some kind of introduction of yourself that what are you doing exactly in your company? Just very sure, that would be fantastic.Sure. So, uh, I'm Frank Falco, [...0.6s] director of member engagement with Engine. Engine is the Next Generation Manufacturing Canada. And our goal is to increase Canada's advance manufacturing capabilities. Uh. We do that through funding of, uh, processing Uber projects. Uh. We also help companies, uh, [...0.5s] share their [...0.4s] expertise on the international market of like Hanna Vernessa, which we do.And [...0.4s] we have our entry summit in Toronto and also these are opportunities, again, as we develop the new products, we allow them to, to get, [...0.9s] you know, to get some exposure. Uh. We also, you know, we run some clusters.We help support clusters, so, like kinda makes AI for manufacturing and about 49, 40 other clusters, 40 total clusters is part of the Engine Canadian accelerator network as we call it.That's a big part of a, [...0.4s] or how we reach out to the different verticals in the advanced manufacturing sector, you know like additive or a hyper manufacturing.Yeah, that's the, the primary things that we do newsletter, of course, reach out facility, connect people, so many things and we can do to help our Canadian companies be successful.Yeah, fantastic. It's so good to hear that. Uh, so, uh, again, this, uh, some kind of, the whole process of in this interview would be around 50 to 20 minutes.I know your, uh, separate schedule would be so tight. Again, thank you for being here. Uh, I'm going to ask you a couple of questions and if you just can't answer them, that would be fantastic.By the way, I was [...0.5s] having an interview with couple of industries and other people, they told me that some of the parts are confidential, so I completely understand that right now. I don't need in detail information, a big picture would be fine.Again, as I just told you, I'm trying to validate my work. I'm not trying to implant deployed right now.So my first question would be that what are the top 3 unsolved challenges you hear from engine members when they are trying to move am from prototyping to production? [...2.5s]Yeah. So scaling up is often, you know, the [...0.8s] term will hear and [...1.3s] one of the things, of course, I've never been in that situation myself, but I have to talk to companies who have been in that situation [...0.5s] and [...0.8s] it's even harder than the startup.Um you know, so many of the things work fine in the lab as you probably know as a PhD student, but it's another story when you wanna scale it up and do mass production.So, [...0.6s] you know, that's really the big, big challenge I find for companies. And well, one of the things, it's the liability of supply chains, of course, you know, that they can count on. Um you know, that's the biggest one.Of course, everybody kind of got a dose of reality during Covid, of course. And it's right now, of course, it's even more influx for while I don't have to get into the reasons, but, [...0.5s] you know, business doesn't like uncertainty and there's a lot of uncertainty right now.Yeah, yeah, completely get it. Thank you very much. And leading us for the next question, do engine members struggle to manage a digital in some kind of inventories of 3D printable parts? Is anyone doing this well or is there some kind of gap in between?Because the reason that I'm asking this question is [...0.4s] actually I was trying to talk about my project at the end, but part of my project is focusing on shifting from the physical inventory to digital inventory. That's why part of these questions is related to that.Again, I'm trying to validate this idea to see that is it available or not. That's the reason I'm asking this question. So [...0.6s] recently [...0.6s] at Canada makes, uh, we've been engaging with some of the larger companies and hear hear, hearing about some of the larger companies.We're talking the, [...0.6s] uh, big players in the thing, how that they, they have, you know, inventories of hundreds of thousands of parts.Yeah okay, some of them legacy, some of them, and, and they don't really know what is, [...0.7s] um, they're looking for solutions of, you know, is it digital inventory even a possibility [...0.6s] or, you know, and I, so a lot of more asking that questions, and we've been able to help with. We're using that kind of makes.Maybe you heard a select am [...0.6s] tool, [...0.6s] it's [...0.7s] Mark Kirby. If you know, Mark Kirby, he's kind of taking a lead on that account that makes. But the idea is, is you can dump in all your parts [...0.5s] into this database and some of them will know where you can get it to have common, you know, product numbers, but some of them are not.And then of the part they may say, well, you know, you have good candidates of, let's say 10,000 parts that could be an additive, additively done.So this is the kind of a tool to help compare and see any, any, uh you know, is it, can it be additive or is it better just a machine or traditional manufacturing processes?So [...0.5s] yeah, there's certainly a lot of people looking at that. The bigger public have started to kind of you know, this has been talked about for some years now and I've been seeing this.But, [...0.7s] you know, I think it's like talk is one thing and implication this is something, [...2.5s] but I think that a lot of them see the value of that especially with, you know you know, you don't have to have the physical product, you can just have the thing. But, [...0.8s] you know, is it, is it remote?Do you do? Like, it also comes up with the question, do you ship manufacturing capabilities, you know like, we were talking about defense is the big topic nowadays, right? So of course, some of these are talking about shipbuilding.This is the questions, you know yeah, so the parts, so, yeah, a lot of people looking at it. Uh, and, you know, whether it works or not is, of course that what, that's what they're looking at. You know, of course, it's gonna work to a certain extent.I think the idea is, is they need a better, um um, not a better, but some of them know it's, it's like you know, you're not gonna get your all your parts can do. That doesn't make sense, but there are certain key parts. I think that's what they're starting to realize. Yeah, yeah, completely makes sense. And so [...0.5s] thank you.Have you seen successful examples of companies integrating predictive maintenance with spare parts ordering? Is this a priority for engine members? [...1.5s] I don't have a lot of information on that.Um, the predictive maintenance is, you know, certainly [...0.7s] something with the AI for manufacturing group that I'm also there.You know, that's such an advantage there that you cannot predict it when you're made this gonna do [...0.4s] with the advert thing. It's, they're all part, parts, that's why they're so close with us. And I, I created both those groups. They are for manufacturing Canada and Canada make.So, [...0.4s] you know, you understand that there's a lot of crossover with knowledge of degree, those love way I get to this and it's everywhere. And I think it certainly can offer a lot of help in that particular area. Makes sense. Makes sense. I don't have a, yeah yeah, so please don't. I'm sorry.Yeah, no, I was gonna say I don't really know a lot about, about the success or not.Yeah yeah, yeah, got it. So actually my next question would be about that. And actually I like it when you mention AI a lot of times. This is something that I'm year to work on that. So are you aware of any platforms that engine members currently use for finding certified am facilities or managing am supply chains?So the reason I'm asking that is part of it related to AI, and part of my work is about AI. And another thing that actually I was talking with some people in now newfounds land, and they told me that specially after Covid, the guy came up with a really good phrase.It was, [...0.5s] it seems that after Covid, nothing has replayed repaired. It means that everything was changed. So one of the issues that they have was finding the right part for the right problem.So in, as some kind of, in engine some kind of this, the company that you're working it or maybe other kind of company, have they face any kind of challenge in order to find the certified part? It doesn't matter it is editive manufacturing or traditional part. [...1.3s] You mean by finding somebody who could make the part or finding the part?No, just finding the part, finding the part, the supply chain, finding the part. Yeah, the supply chain issue, I haven't heard anything correctly doesn't mean it doesn't exist, of course.But no, I don't really have [...0.6s] a good answer for that. [...1.1s] The, the one thing I can say is like, um, when the Covid happened, so many companies realized that, oh, [...0.4s] we don't make it in Canada, you know, masks all these sort of things.And yeah, of course not, you know, because everybody wants to cheap on, they go to China.So then it was kind of like a waking up in certain areas. So [...0.5s] certain companies pivoted, invested to be able to make it in Canada, [...0.5s] only to come when things came down that the procurement people, [...0.8s] particularly hospitals, went back to their old clients who sourced out of China. So there was not a lesson Learned.And I'm quite disappointed in that because, you know, some companies went bankrupt because they expected the business to continue after Covid.They made money during Covid, [...0.5s] okay, but then, oh, although, you know, there there's doesn't always so many people have a disconnect of [...0.6s] where it's made [...0.6s] and availability. They think, well, everything is fine, we'll just get it out of China [...0.6s] until the next time.You know what? It, it's really amazing how fucking stupid people are, [...0.5s] or how I guess, no, it's not so stupid as [...0.4s] how short of a memory they have, and how there wasn't, like, even this talking to cure right now with defense and all that.And, [...0.6s] you know, you have to have it available, kind of medical defense, agriculture. These are things that you can't rely on other people.Yes, you know, and you're silly if you do. But I thought Covid would have been a wake me up, or it won't be in defense is the same thing, like, [...0.4s] what are you gonna go buy stuff out of potentially arrival, you know like, the compress press the button, say none for you today, buddy. Haha, you know like uh, what do you mean?None. You know what people laugh and it's true, but it's absolutely true, yes. You know like if you buy an F35, there's an example F35, they could turn it off.You know, I don't know why anybody in the world would buy an F35 before they. I, I wouldn't buy any new fighters anyways. I would just stick to drones and missiles because, you know like [...0.4s] why have a man in this thing when he can't handle the Jeep forces of the missiles that are trying to hit him?Again, anyways, you know the stories. Um you know [...0.7s] the, there's a lot to know that, that's kind of the area there people don't learn the procurement, people don't learn the manufacturing. People understand it. They know that downstream and upstream supply chains [...0.5s] are big deal. You know, they're fine when everything works. We have a globalized thing, but when it doesn't work, you're in big trouble.Yeah, exactly. I agree, agree. Putting even more. So, um, [...0.6s] let me ask you another question I'm trying to make, so if you have to identify a couple of member companies that you are working with [...0.4s] that were already using the some kind of am production part, obviously not as the whole scenario, at least for part of their work.Could you name me a couple of companies that actually are not fully functional based on am, but at least they're giving am a chance.You know, [...0.5s] one of the things that I [...0.6s] hurt so much is that at least there's not that much of a trust in additive manufacture, especially from [...0.4s] oil and gas people, especially when they're working with big companies.So do you have all the companies that actually are fully, so [...0.5s] oil gas country company, you're just an old one. It was a good one. Um, so I have the am demo program I run, okay, which I deal with a lot of companies trying.So few years back, there was a company called on stream [...0.7s] in Alberta. They made pipeline inspection gauges, so they call them pigs.Okay, and [...0.6s] some year, few years back, they were building a new one, designing a new one. They thought that maybe additive of certain parts in the additive could work and have low production runs.So I introduced them to Precision ADM in Winnipeg, [...0.5s] who suggested they do titanium. They did some poop coupons, they did some [...0.5s] field tests, and now they buy$1 million parts a year.Okay, so that's, that's a particular [...0.6s] good example of a winner, but I've done hundreds of these, and most of them, I don't know if they go anywhere.Sometimes, you know they, I don't follow up. I don't have the resource to follow up for one thing, and, [...0.4s] but, so this, you know the ideas is, you know we [...0.5s] program is there to introduce them to the capabilities, at least some of the capabilities and answer some questions for them whether they go into the production level.You know that's, that's another story. Probably you're the best, you know to talk to some of the service providers that I work with, you know because [...0.5s] they, you know they're the ones that follow up. I give the 5,000 for the demo program.It works or not, [...0.8s] you don't make sense. That's up to them. Is the service prior to really follow up? It's not I, I can't you know I can't like, it doesn't go anywhere, is what I'm saying most of the time. It doesn't.Okay, but again, I'm throwing a lot of things against the wall to see what sticks. And of course some do. So my, the answer to my question is I don't really have a good answer, but I couldn't you know I don't know if you're gonna talk to any of these service providers.Probably the people you should talk to like precision ATM, uh, egg surgery or, or, um, next level manufacturing out west, uh, [...0.7s] uh access prototype, [...1.5s] you know you can see the list on Canada makes the service partner is probably a good one. [...1.6s]They would be the ones that would best [...0.6s] know about, you know who's using it for production. Like this would be what we want to know, you know like everybody, we all know it's great for prototyping.That's not the point. Is it [...0.5s] who, who can use it for prototype and I mean by production, that's [...0.5s] again, the am demo program is about, [...0.5s] you know they know it's good for prototyping, but can it be used for production?So [...0.4s] if the big companies making millions of it, I go, well, the first one is gonna be good, but you're gonna go to injection molding, right? Likely, you know yeah yeah complete and said thank you very much.So I'm done with all of my questions, but I do have one last question. So [...0.5s] it will be better to talk about my idea first in detail. So the idea that I have on working right now on it, [...0.4s] first of all, it's going to be the Canada base.I mean the very first thing that we thought about this idea was that apparently Europe came up with some kind of product with some kind of solutions. I know a couple of companies in Asia.I've heard that US also [...0.7s] came up with this idea, but we thought that in Canada still needs some kind of uh, some kind of work that's why we came up with this.So the idea is this that we would like to make an ecosystem between different kind of entities, Oems, the clot, the end users, the 3D printing facilities, the authorities and that.And at the end of the day, we would like to make sure that for instance, if someone needs an equipment, he or she can reach out to that equipment as soon as possible. Imagine that you do have the offshore company, they need a part, they have to make they have to wait weeks.Did you have all of the communication, all of those regulation, all of the problems that you better know better than me?And also beside of that idea, um, since I'm working with AI, I mean it's big part of my PhD, I thought that why not try to integrate this platform we are making and offer it to different kind of investors and say that, hey, I do have an AI and if you are you installed enough equipment for you or if you give me enough data, I can help you not only in your some kind of the functional part, but also I can help you, as you just mention, in order to shifting you from physical inventory to digital inventory, anything that AI can do. As we know, AI is everywhere these days.So about the prediction about helping you to understand the problem and so on and so forth. So since you mentioned that you are also going to focus so much on AI because that's a good thing, I mean so far I talk with industries, they don't have that much of idea what AI can do in their industries.I mean I was kind of disappointed because I see that, okay, AI is everywhere, you can see the potential, right?Uh, either they didn't have that much of an idea or no company came to them say that, hey, this is AI package, I can do this for you. I can reduce your downtime cost because you are if any part fails, you are losing at least 500 to 1 million dollar each day. You don't want that.So this is something that I'm working on. What is your [...0.8s] perspective [...0.8s] about using AI in this idea that I had or any other kind of aspect of additive manufacturing or maybe additive manufacturing?So like I said, we, we, we were, yeah, you know we recently had a, the Air Force reach out to Canada makes, so Canada makes, you know, dogs remember that we should probably get you a little bit more aligned with that, maybe allowed to market works.Because [...0.8s] we were asked, okay, if they were to seek come to, what's the, what's the availability and capabilities of the supply chain in Canada?And, and so we've done a lot of work towards that. So there's a, [...0.8s] there's like a list on [...0.7s] value chain, we've used it. It's an engine can network, okay, remember I mentioned you how we do cluster works.Okay, so, [...0.4s] yeah, one of the things we've started to map is the capabilities of the members of each of these institutions.Canada makes being the, the prime example. So the idea is, yeah, AI is also the tool to complement that. We're also working on tools that end gen about [...0.5s] not, not like yours, a little bit more about, [...0.7s] you know, I need this to do this, [...0.9s] you know, that sort of [...0.9s] witches [...0.5s] again, and we have this tool we're trying to use, [...1.0s] not really there yet.It's like 65% accurate, which isn't good enough to go to market, [...0.4s] you know, like when so [...0.4s] it's something we certainly are, are looking to, to bring in Canada, makes, we're looking to be able to answer those questions and yes, listen, I wanna make this and then [...0.4s] will the AI tell you, well, you need a polymer, you need this, maybe need metal 3D printing.This, this, this the take, it'll take you two weeks to get this part. Here's the available. It would be great to have that all done. Like [...0.5s] press this button here and it's on order and you'll have it in two weeks.Yeah, that's the perfect thing you want, you know, and that sort of tool would be really, really nice, you know, to take it. And [...0.4s] do you know Mark Kirby?No, no, you know, Mark. Okay, you should [...1.0s] reach out to Mark Kirby. He's [...0.8s] probably the most knowledgeable person [...0.8s] in Canada at least, but if not the world. Who is one of the most. He works at Pronos Jet and Pi. He's a used to be No. 1. He was a literally rocket side and MIT No. 1 in this class.So this guy's brilliant. Okay, he works for me as a consultant. He's the one that's been putting those tools together. So, [...0.4s] um, I will do an introduction to him. Uh, and, uh, you know ask him, you can ask him if you can give you 30 minutes to answer those.He would be [...0.5s] about the best in the country to ask you that you'll really like him. And he's not too far from me.We'll be doing some workshops. The idea of we were reached out by a color, color, [...0.5s] you know, your locals and there might be a workshop not too far from you guys done in the next coming months. So that's good. Do you get my you get my newsletter right? Uh, no, no, no fortunately no.Okay, go to engine. Okay? Okay, the website, yeah, then join. Okay, it's free. Okay, that'll get you on our list, and of course, the, [...0.4s] the news that I send it every two weeks, and it can tell you about project funding type of things happening events. So forth the work of it. I try to keep the people informed.The idea is that workshop that would come up, you could see it there and then it's, it would be done, and we haven't said put a date or anything yet, but [...0.8s] the ideas [...0.5s] to help inform, like, maybe, like talk about what you're talking about too.You know, like these are all the areas that we have to, you know, that people recognize for a while now. It's nothing new, but it's one thing to talk about a thing, it's another thing to put it in practice, right?Yes, it's, [...0.6s] and we did it, so this is where you're at is trying to get good business case. So I'll do an intro to Mark fantastic, [...0.9s] and, yeah, you, [...1.6s] that's perfect.Yes, actually. One of the favors that they would like to ask is that try to connect me if you can with many people expertise like you, as many as possible. Because again, I'm at the validating face. I'm trying to understand that how good this ideas for the market.And the final favor that I do have is that obviously right now I'm at the searching phase. I'm just like a toddler try to learn how to walk. Would that be okay? Maybe anytime in the future I can reach out to you and say that, hey, I gather this kind of knowledge.Would that be okay if you do have another kind of maybe 15 minutes, 30 minutes, everything together, probably fantastic.Yeah, I can help. I'd like to also introduce you to my colleague Nicole. She's an Isle of likes actually, so [...0.8s] she's been running candidates for a few years, so [...0.6s] she'll know you about your colleagues and all that.And since Dalhousie as a member, we can, we could she could facilitate those introductions, [...0.6s] actually let me see if I can pull her in really quick and we can, [...0.6s] let me see if I can, [...10.3s] I don't know why, [...23.8s] maybe not, maybe not. I'll do it. That's okay, that's totally fine.Yeah, I'll tell her to follow up with you. I'll do an intro of to both you and Mark, her and Mark.Fantastic, fantastic, [...0.7s] okay, okay, perfect. Thank you very much, thank you very much for the time. It was so nice to see you and hopefully we can see each other soon. There's what, there is one thing, um, do you have travel budget or anything like that? Uh, travel, but sorry about what I didn't get [...0.5s] budget to travel. Yeah, yeah, why not?Do you know about Hanover Mesa, the event we're doing? No, actually. So there's two events, there's the N3 Summit, okay? That's our event that we're doing in Toronto on [...0.7s] March 31st, April 1st. Uh, they'll be about 100 exhibitors there, [...0.4s] um, not additive only, but it is advanced manufacturer, okay, [...0.8s] and lots of people to talk to and Han over Mesa, Han over Mesa is the largest industrial trade show in the world.Okay, okay, it's, [...0.4s] uh, April twenty to 24th, I have three pavilions there, [...0.6s] um, as a startup [...1.3s] or is the academia, if you could find another person, I can give you a booth, okay, kiosk. [...1.6s]It would take it in minimum to people. I have a reimbursement where I give you back 50% of your travel and accommodation costs.Okay, yeah, that's good. You mentioned that April 20th to 24th, [...0.6s] yeah, yeah, okay, okay, I mean okay I'll send you I'll send you info so let me let me show you really quick I can got a couple more minutes. I'll show you [...1.0s] a little bit about the event. I, cause I, lots of Canadians are gonna be there.Lots, so the main point is for both, of course. But, [...0.6s] so these, this is the event the April 20 24th, the 19th Sunday is a welcome dinner which everybody's invited to where we'll have about 350 Canadian art Canadians.There is Team Canada. We have three pavilions, automation, uh, [...0.6s] uh, automation, AI for manufacturing, defense and robotics and digital.So, uh, we would probably put you in the 14 if you were to come, cause while it's the only place, I really have place left. Uh, this is, kind of, what it looks like. We have a podcast [...0.6s] hospitalities included.You get drinks coffee all day. There's happy hour, like I said, the event on Sunday night. We are doing AI for manufacturing [...0.6s] workshops.There's also trade commissioners B to B sessions in here. And of course, these are all our exhibitors. So all 14, these are the companies that are [...1.3s] a student there at university of Manitoba. Here's your Regina, [...0.6s] uh, but as you can see, mostly companies, uh, we have Alberta, [...0.7s] we have, um, [...0.8s] Albertos.Anyways you can see this is kind of what it looks like getting. That's the podcast area, [...0.5s] that's what, that's what you get as an exhibitorist, one of these, [...0.6s] perfect. [...1.5s]So it's$2,000, okay, [...0.6s] so you get that and then, [...0.5s] then you get a reimbursement of up to$20,000 expenses up to 50%, so maximum of$10,000 reimbursement, flights, accommodation, we even have a perdium of$200 a day [...0.6s] for two, for two people for five days so [...0.5s] again so you can, if you bring two people, it cost you less than$10,000.I would think, [...2.1s] okay, I will do the intro and I'll send you the information package.Um, [...0.6s] and, um, yeah, get back to me really quick on that because I'm almost out of space if you are, but it could be a really great opportunity to meet a lot of different Canadians and additive, it's a, it's a show with all by manufacturer, [...0.5s] okay it's not just an additive show, it's all the different technologies additive exclude.Yeah, fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. I will consider everything, and I really respect you as soon as possible. Thank you. Appreciate you, man. Thank you for your time. Bye bye. [...5.0s][...5.0s]
