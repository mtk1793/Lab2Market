## 🔑 Key Context

Frank is **THE most connected person in Canadian AM** - he founded Canada Makes and now serves NGen's entire manufacturing community. He's not an end-user; he's an **ecosystem builder** who can validate whether there's a market gap for your digital inventory platform based on what he hears from NGen members across energy, aerospace, automotive, and mining.

**Critical Insight:** His background in web development/SEO + AM makes him uniquely qualified to comment on the **digital transformation** aspect of your platform.

## 📋 The 6 Critical Questions

### **1. What are the TOP 3 unsolved challenges you hear from NGen members when they try to move AM from prototyping to production?**

**Why Critical:**
- Validates our entire value proposition from ecosystem perspective
- Tests NH.2 (Obsolescence), NH.7 (Certification), H50 (Risk categorization)
- Identifies whether our platform addresses real vs perceived problems

**What to Listen For:**
- Do they mention obsolete parts, finding qualified facilities, or digital inventory management?
- Is certification/qualification the main blocker?
- Are post-processing services (coatings, finishing) mentioned as gaps?

---

### **2. Do NGen members struggle to manage digital inventories of 3D-printable parts? Is anyone doing this well, or is it still a gap?**

**Why Critical:**
- **Direct validation** of our core platform value (NH.9 - Digital inventory reduces lead time)
- Tests whether the problem exists and whether competitors have solved it
- Identifies if this is a "nice to have" or "critical need"

**What to Listen For:**
- Current solutions being used (Fieldnode, PartBox, Excel spreadsheets?)
- Pain intensity: is this preventing production adoption of AM?
- Success stories or complete absence of good solutions

---

### **3. Have you seen successful examples of companies integrating predictive maintenance with spare parts ordering? Is this a priority for NGen members?**

**Why Critical:**
- Tests our **ultimate vision** (NH.5, H53 - Predictive maintenance + digital inventory)
- Validates whether Jason Power's insight (Interview 4) about this being "#1 unmet need" is true at ecosystem scale
- Determines if this should be MVP feature or Phase 3/4

**What to Listen For:**
- Are NGen members already investing in IoT/predictive maintenance?
- Is this viewed as "future state" or "urgent need"?
- Any examples of failed attempts to integrate these systems?

---

### **4. Are you aware of any platforms that NGen members currently use for finding certified AM facilities or managing AM supply chains?**

**Why Critical:**
- **Competitive landscape intel** from someone who sees the entire Canadian market
- Tests whether our differentiation (AI + digital inventory + certification) matters
- Identifies if we're solving a new problem or need to displace incumbents

**What to Listen For:**
- Names of competitors (Fieldnode, MFG, etc.)
- What's working and what's not working about current solutions
- Market gaps that no one has filled yet

---

### **5. If you had to identify 3-5 NGen member companies that are: (a) already using AM for production parts, (b) struggling with inventory/lead times, and (c) open to piloting new platforms - who would you recommend I speak with?**

**Why Critical:**
- **Direct path to early adopters** - this could accelerate GTM by 6+ months
- Turns interview into pipeline generation
- Tests whether Frank sees enough value to make warm introductions

**What to Listen For:**
- Specific company names and warm intro offers
- Which sectors he recommends (energy, mining, aerospace)
- Whether he hedges or enthusiastically offers connections

---

### **6. Would NGen be interested in partnering on a pilot project to test a platform that: (a) categorizes parts by AM risk, (b) connects companies to certified facilities, (c) maintains digital part inventories, and (d) integrates with predictive maintenance?**

**Why Critical:**
- **Partnership opportunity** - NGen funding + member access + credibility
- Forces Frank to evaluate our entire value prop and give feedback
- Opens door to Stream 1/Stream 2 funding discussions

**What to Listen For:**
- Immediate interest or skepticism about each feature
- Questions about tech stack, pricing, IP, data security
- Willingness to discuss next steps (funding application, pilot design)
- Which feature resonates most strongly
