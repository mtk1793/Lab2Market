# Interview 15 - Mikhail Gladkikh (Baker Hughes / Würth)
## FINAL 4-5 QUESTIONS (Carol-Focused)

**Meeting:** February 4, 2026, 4:00pm  
**Time Limit:** 30 minutes = 4-5 questions MAX

---

## Q1: Current Problem & Cost (CRITICAL - Carol's Question)

> "During your time leading AM at Baker Hughes, what was the #1 barrier preventing oil & gas operators from adopting additive manufacturing at scale?
>
> I'm hearing conflicting signals: academics say **certification**, industry says **business case**, offshore operators say **space constraints**.
>
> From your real-world experience, which had the biggest impact? And **how much did it cost operators** in terms of:
> - Certification time/money per part?
> - Downtime waiting for traditionally-sourced parts?
> - Inventory carrying costs for physical spare parts?
>
> I need specific **$$$ data** to prove the value of solving this."

**Listen for:** Quantified costs, barrier priority, Baker Hughes solution

---

## Q2: Who Pays? (CRITICAL - Carol's Question)

> "At Baker Hughes, who actually paid for digital inventory / AM solutions?
>
> - Was it the oil & gas operators (end users)?
> - Baker Hughes (as the service provider)?
> - Split investment?
>
> **Who has budget authority** for this type of innovation at oil & gas companies? Operations? IT? Innovation fund?
>
> And **what ROI threshold** did they need to approve it? 6 months payback? 20% cost savings?"

**Listen for:** Buyer persona, budget source, approval thresholds

---

## Q3: Faster, Cheaper, or Better? (Carol's Question)

> "If you could change ONE thing about oil & gas spare parts management, would you make it:
> - **Faster** (reduce lead times from X months to Y months)?
> - **Cheaper** (cut inventory costs by Z%)?
> - **Better** (higher reliability, less downtime)?
>
> Which matters MOST to the decision-maker signing the check?
>
> And **how much would they pay** to solve that #1 problem?"

**Listen for:** Competitive advantage positioning, willingness to pay

---

## Q4: Baker Hughes Digital Inventory (Market Validation)

> "Dr. Nasiri mentioned Equinor and ExxonMobil are implementing digital inventory with Siemens—shifting from physical warehouses to CAD libraries + AM-on-demand.
>
> Did Baker Hughes pursue similar strategy? If so:
> - **Did it work?** (adoption rate?)
> - **What failed?** (what would you NOT do again?)
> - **Who paid for it?** (operators or Baker Hughes?)
>
> And at Würth now, are clients asking for this?"

**Listen for:** Peer validation, implementation learnings, market pull signal

---

## Q5: Workflow Verification Patent (IF TIME)

> "I saw you hold a patent for end-to-end verification of manufacturing workflows—exactly what regulators want for AM certification traceability.
>
> **Quantified question:** If automated workflow tracking could reduce certification time by 50% (from X months to Y months), **what would that be worth** to oil & gas operators?
>
> And would regulators (DNV, Lloyd's) accept automated verification?"

**Listen for:** Certification cost/time savings, regulatory acceptance, IP licensing potential

---

## CRITICAL FOLLOW-UPS (Dig Deeper - Carol's Mandate):

**If vague answer:** "Can you put a number on that? $X per part? Y days of delay?"

**If mentions "it depends":** "What's the minimum and maximum range? Best case vs worst case?"

**If says "cheaper/faster is priority":** "By how much? 10%? 50%? What's the threshold that makes them switch?"

**End:** "Who else at Baker Hughes or in oil & gas should I talk to about the $$$ side of this problem?"

---

## SUCCESS = Leave with:
✅ **$$$  cost data** (certification, downtime, inventory)  
✅ **Buyer persona** (who signs the check)  
✅ **ROI threshold** (what % savings approves purchase)  
✅ **Competitive advantage** (faster/cheaper/better priority)  
✅ **Baker Hughes case study** (worked or failed?)
