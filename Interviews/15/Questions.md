## QUESTION 1: Oil & Gas AM Adoption Barriers (Baker Hughes Experience)

**Background:** Dr. Nasiri (Interview 11) said certification is THE barrier in oil & gas. Mark Kirby (Interview 9) said business case is THE barrier. Mikhail has real-world experience at scale.

**Question:**

> "During your time leading AM services at Baker Hughes, what was the #1 barrier preventing oil & gas operators from adopting additive manufacturing at scale?
>
> I'm hearing conflicting signals from my interviews:
> - Academics say it's **certification** (regulatory bodies can't keep up with AM development)
> - Industry consultants say it's **business case** (lifetime savings are hard to quantify)
> - Offshore operators say it's **space constraints** on vessels
>
> From your experience deploying AM in real oil & gas operations, which barrier had the biggest impact on adoption, and how did Baker Hughes address it?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Expert arbitration:** Mikhail can break the tie (certification vs business case vs space)
- **Real-world validation:** He's implemented at scale, not theorizing
- **Solution insight:** How did Baker Hughes solve it? (learn from their playbook)

**What You're Testing:**
- **Barrier hierarchy:** Which is truly #1? (informs platform priority)
- **Certification pathway:** Did Baker Hughes develop internal process? (template for platform)
- **Business case model:** How did they prove ROI? (platform feature opportunity)

## QUESTION 2: Digital Inventory Implementation (Baker Hughes / Würth Scale)

**Background:** Equinor/ExxonMobil using Siemens for digital inventory (Nasiri). Baker Hughes is peer company. Did they build similar capability?

**Question:**

> "Dr. Nasiri mentioned that Equinor and ExxonMobil are implementing digital inventory systems—shifting from massive physical spare parts warehouses to CAD libraries with AM-on-demand.
>
> Did Baker Hughes pursue a similar strategy during your tenure? If so:
> - What worked well, and what failed?
> - How did you handle the transition from 'physical inventory on every rig' to 'digital library accessible to all rigs'?
> - Did operators actually USE the digital parts library, or did adoption lag behind the technology?
>
> And now at Würth Additive Group, are you seeing clients ask for this capability?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Peer validation:** If Baker Hughes did it, strongly validates Equinor/Exxon model
- **Implementation learnings:** Real failures/successes (avoid their mistakes)
- **Adoption insight:** Did operators resist change? (change management = platform feature?)

**What You're Testing:**
- **Digital inventory feasibility:** Does it work at oil & gas scale, or is it theoretical?
- **Adoption barriers:** Technology works but people don't use it? (training? trust?)
- **Würth market signal:** Are clients asking for this = market pull?

## QUESTION 3: Patents & Workflow Verification (Platform Integration)

**Background:** Mikhail holds patent for "end-to-end verification of manufacturing workflows" (LinkedIn). This could be critical for certification.

**Question:**

> "I saw you hold a patent for end-to-end verification of manufacturing workflows. That seems directly relevant to the certification challenge in AM—regulators want traceability from powder batch to final part to know everything was done correctly.
>
> Could you explain how that workflow verification works in practice? And do you see a role for automated verification systems in accelerating AM certification for oil & gas / offshore applications?
>
> Specifically, if a digital inventory platform could automatically document the entire production workflow (machine settings, powder lot, operator credentials, testing results), would that meaningfully reduce certification time or cost?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Technical validation:** Is automated workflow tracking = certification accelerator?
- **Platform feature:** Should you build this into platform? (competitive advantage)
- **Partnership opportunity:** Could Mikhail's IP integrate with your platform?

**What You're Testing:**
- **Certification automation:** Can AI + workflow tracking reduce certification burden?
- **Regulatory acceptance:** Do DNV/Lloyd's Register accept automated verification?
- **IP licensing:** Could you license Mikhail's patent for platform?

## QUESTION 4: Würth Additive Group Strategy (Market Trends)

**Background:** Mikhail recently moved from Baker Hughes (oil & gas services) to Würth Additive Group (industrial AM). This shift signals market trends.

**Question:**

> "You recently transitioned from Baker Hughes to Würth Additive Group. That's a shift from oil & gas-specific AM services to broader industrial AM.
>
> What drove that move for you personally, and what market trends are you seeing at Würth that made industrial AM more attractive than oil & gas AM?
>
> I'm trying to understand: Is oil & gas AM adoption slowing (not worth focusing on), or is it just a different business model (enterprise vs SME, for example)?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Market signal:** Why did expert leave oil & gas? (red flag for platform?)
- **Trend identification:** What's growing faster (oil & gas vs industrial)?
- **Platform positioning:** Should you focus oil & gas or broaden to industrial?

**What You're Testing:**
- **Market health:** Is oil & gas AM stagnant or just slow-moving?
- **Opportunity size:** Industrial AM bigger market than offshore?
- **Customer segment:** Enterprise (Equinor/Exxon) vs SME (smaller operators)?

## FOLLOW-UP OPPORTUNITIES:

**If Mikhail says certification is #1 barrier:**
> "Baker Hughes likely has more resources than a typical offshore operator to navigate certification. For smaller companies without regulatory affairs teams, what's the most cost-effective way to certify AM parts—internal labs, third-party contractors, or something else?"

**If Mikhail mentions digital inventory adoption was slow at Baker Hughes:**
> "What would have accelerated adoption? Better training? Clearer ROI demonstration? Integration with existing procurement systems?"

**If Mikhail is enthusiastic about workflow verification for certification:**
> "Would you be open to exploring a pilot integration? I'm building a digital inventory platform, and automated workflow verification could be the key to solving the certification bottleneck."

**If Mikhail mentions oil & gas AM is too enterprise-focused:**
> "Are there mid-size operators (not majors like Equinor/Exxon) who are hungry for this but can't afford enterprise solutions like Siemens? That's the segment I'm targeting."

**At the end:**
> "You've seen AM at global scale (Baker Hughes) and now supporting diverse industrial clients (Würth). Who else should I talk to—either in oil & gas or adjacent industries—who's doing digital inventory or certification pathway optimization well?"

## KEY INSIGHTS TO LISTEN FOR:

✅ **Barrier priority:** Certification vs business case vs space (which is truly #1?)  
✅ **Baker Hughes digital inventory:** Did they build it? Did it work? (case study data)  
✅ **Certification pathway:** How did Baker Hughes streamline? (DNV/Lloyd's process?)  
✅ **Workflow verification:** Can automation reduce cert cost/time? (platform feature)  
✅ **Market shift:** Why oil & gas → industrial AM? (platform focus implications)  
✅ **Enterprise vs SME:** Are majors only market, or can mid-size operators afford solutions?  
✅ **Würth client demand:** Are industrial clients asking for digital inventory?
