# Interview 15 - Mikhail Gladkikh (Baker Hughes/Würth)
## 5 QUESTIONS ONLY

**1. OIL & GAS AM ADOPTION BARRIERS:**
"From your Baker Hughes experience, what was the biggest barrier to AM adoption in oil & gas—certification complexity, business case uncertainty, or operational concerns? How are those barriers different now that you're at Würth working with European clients?"

**2. DIGITAL INVENTORY EVOLUTION:**
"Did Baker Hughes pursue digital inventory solutions, similar to what Equinor and ExxonMobil are doing? What worked well and what didn't? Are Würth's industrial clients asking for similar capabilities now?"

**3. OIL & GAS VS INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING:**
"What's the biggest difference between oil & gas spare parts challenges and general industrial manufacturing? Does digital inventory solve the same problems in both sectors, or are the use cases completely different?"

**4. AUTOMATED WORKFLOW AND CERTIFICATION:**
"If automated workflow tracking could streamline certification and compliance documentation, would that change how quickly companies adopt AM? What role do regulators (DNV, Lloyd's) play—are they open to digital verification tools?"

**5. ECOSYSTEM PLATFORM VISION:**
"Imagine a platform that connects operators, AM suppliers, OEMs, and certification bodies in one ecosystem—like a digital marketplace for verified industrial parts. What would make that valuable to your clients? What concerns or trust issues would need to be addressed?"
