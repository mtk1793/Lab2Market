Hi Mikhail,

Thank you for the detailed conversation about OMV's offshore operations and your vision for AI-powered inventory management. Your perspective on why additive manufacturing needs strong ROI proof before adoption was exactly the reality check I needed.

## Key Takeaways

**1. The 15% ROI Threshold**

Your requirement that the platform **"must show at least 15% ROI"** is now my target benchmark. I'm structuring proof-of-concept pilots to generate exactly this kind of quantified data:

- Example: $10M/year spare parts spending → 15% reduction = $1.5M/year savings
- Plus: Working capital freed from reduced physical inventory
- Plus: Downtime reduction (hours → revenue protection)

**2. AI as Strategic Imperative**

Your certainty that **"inventory management should be fully AI-based"** and that companies **"won't be competitive"** without it validates the AI-first approach. The platform is now positioned as an **AI optimization engine** that decides:

- Which parts to stock physically (high-volume, common)
- Which parts to maintain digitally (low-volume, specialized)
- How to source (OEM vs. aftermarket vs. AM)

**3. Safety Certification as Gating Factor**

I completely understand that offshore oil & gas requires proven safety data before AM adoption. My strategy is to:

1. **Prove with other industries first** (Navy, aerospace where certification pathways exist)
2. **Collect safety/performance data** from those deployments
3. **Return to OMV** (2-3 years) with validated solutions and DNV/Lloyd's certifications

OMV is a future customer, not immediate—and that's completely appropriate given the safety-first culture.

## Applying Your Feedback

**Business Case Focus:**
- Leading with **"boost your business by 15%"** (not technology features)
- Emphasizing **new customer acquisition** (growth, not just cost savings)
- Quantifying outcomes (revenue protection, working capital, efficiency)

**IP Protection:**
- On-premise architecture (files don't leave customer systems)
- Addressing the **"people will hide behind IP"** barrier technically, not just contractually

**Offshore-Specific Value:**
- Targeting the **"6-month valve wait"** crisis scenario
- Positioning AM as emergency backup (not replacement for OEM parts)
- Reducing lost production from critical part failures

## Thank You

Your insight that **"at the end, you don't apply anything unless it's to make more money"** fundamentally reframed my value proposition. I've been too focused on technology capabilities when I should be focused on business outcomes.

I'll stay in touch as I develop proof-of-concept results. When I have validated 15% ROI case studies from Navy and aerospace deployments, I'd love to re-engage about potential OMV pilot opportunities.
