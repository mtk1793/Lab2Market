# Follow-Up Email: Lee Vessey (Thales Canada / Canadian Navy)

**To:** Lee Vessey  
**Subject:** What 50+ Interviews Revealed — and a Question About IDEaS BOREALIS

---

Hi Lee,

I hope you've been well. Since our conversation, I've completed over 50 customer discovery interviews across Canadian Navy/defence, oil & gas, maritime, and aerospace — and I wanted to share what's emerged, because it connects directly to what you described.

**What the market is telling us**

The theme that keeps coming up, regardless of industry, is the same problem you articulated so clearly: **1/3 to 1/2 of critical parts come from overseas, and when global supply chains are disrupted, the ability to maintain assets is immediately impacted.**

A few patterns that stood out to me after reflecting on our conversation:

- **Certification is the ceiling, not the floor.** Across every vertical — maritime, defence, oil & gas — the single biggest barrier to AM adoption is certification. Regulatory bodies aren't ready, and supply chain teams don't have the AM literacy to even identify which parts are candidates. Your point about needing to "align all stakeholders — testing, certification, standards, materials, approvals" before anyone can print is being confirmed universally.

- **"Nobody carries stock anymore."** Post-COVID, the traditional model of ordering from stock is effectively dead. Everything is pre-ordered with 10–18 month lead times. Companies that aggressively minimized inventory via LEAN optimization have been badly exposed — one senior O&G manager described it as "an atomic bomb going off" when a critical part isn't available. This validates the e-inventory vision you described as "really, really strong."

- **Education precedes technology.** Every interview in the defence and marine sector confirmed your insight: supply chain teams have low knowledge of modern AM. You can't deploy AI tools on top of a team that doesn't understand what AM can actually produce. The education layer has to come first.

- **AI for inventory analysis has explicit demand.** The workflow you sketched — AI analyzes inventory, cross-references materials and sizes, produces a "Top 100 AM candidates" report — is being independently requested by multiple interviewees. A senior Equinor asset manager described their AI already scanning systems to identify which platform has a surplus part for another platform. As he put it: *"You've automated how you MOVE parts — now automate how you MAKE them."* That is AddManuChain's exact value proposition.

- **The government anchor strategy is confirmed.** Multiple interviewees said directly that if Canadian Defence is the first validated customer, the rest of the market — maritime, mining, energy — will follow. The defence sector's certification standards act as a trust signal for the entire commercial ecosystem.

- **Lloyd's Register gave us positive feedback.** We recently had a meeting with the Lloyd's Register team, and they provided encouraging feedback on the platform concept, particularly around the certification and traceability layer. Having a classification society engaged early is something I know aligns with your project's goal of getting all stakeholders aligned before production starts.

- **Irving Shipbuilding — ongoing engagement.** I'm also currently in touch with people at Irving Shipbuilding in Halifax to deepen my understanding of how they manage spare parts and AM adoption on the procurement side. As you know from your own work, Irving sits at a critical intersection of Canadian shipbuilding and defence, and that conversation is helping sharpen where the platform needs to focus first.

- **The Canadian submarine case — a perfect illustration.** Dave Whitehouse at Lloyd's Register shared a striking example directly relevant to your work: Canada's four Victoria-class submarines are all custom-built and each slightly different. Their certification process requires any replacement part to be installed exactly as-built. There are no more original parts in inventory, so everything must be custom-manufactured to match the original. And with only around 5–10 years of operational life remaining, the urgency to solve this without a full production run is acute. He noted that the current Canadian Navy fleet availability sits at 30–50%, against a target of 70–80%. This is precisely the scenario where a digital, as-built inventory with on-demand printing capability would have the most immediate impact — and it maps directly to the sovereign resilience narrative you described.

**A question on IDEaS BOREALIS**

I recently came across the **IDEaS BOREALIS: Defence Innovation Secure Hubs** initiative. Given the focus on moving innovation to operational advantage through secure, distributed hubs — and given everything you've described around sovereign resilience, on-demand parts, and secure digital inventory — I'm curious about your perspective.

Do you see BOREALIS as a potential vehicle for the kind of distributed, secure additive manufacturing network the Navy needs? Is Thales looking at this initiative, and if so, would AddManuChain's platform — designed around connecting OEMs, certified print facilities, and certification authorities in a controlled, traceable ecosystem — be relevant to that conversation?

I would genuinely value your read on this, even a quick sense of whether it's worth exploring together.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
