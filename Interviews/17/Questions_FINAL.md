# Interview 17 - Jean-Michel Fortin (Agnico Eagle Mines)
## FINAL 4-5 QUESTIONS (Carol-Focused)

**Meeting:** February 4, 2026, [TIME]  
**Time Limit:** 30 minutes = 4-5 questions MAX

---

## Q1: Arctic Mining Inventory Costs (CRITICAL - Carol's Question)

> "As a finance director, you see the full P&L impact of inventory management in Arctic mining.
>
> **How much does it cost Agnico Eagle** when:
> - Critical mining equipment parts aren't available on-site (downtime cost per day)?
> - You're transporting spare parts to remote Arctic locations?
> - You're maintaining physical inventory at remote mine sites?
>
> I need **specific $$$ data**: downtime cost/day, logistics costs, inventory carrying costs for remote operations?"

**Listen for:** Quantified costs, Arctic logistics premium, downtime economics

---

## Q2: Who Has Budget Authority? (CRITICAL - Finance Director Perspective)

> "From a finance perspective, who has authority to approve an inventory optimization / digital parts solution at Agnico Eagle?
>
> - Operations (mine site managers)?
> - Procurement (supply chain team)?
> - Finance (CFO approval)?
> - IT (digital transformation budget)?
>
> **What ROI do you need** to approve this type of investment? Payback period? NPV threshold? Cost reduction %?
>
> And **is the end user the same as the buyer?** (mine site vs corporate HQ)"

**Listen for:** Finance approval process, ROI thresholds, decision-making unit

---

## Q3: Business Case for AM in Mining (Non-Structural Parts)

> "For non-structural mining parts (pipe fittings, valve components, hydraulic connectors—NOT load-bearing structural):
>
> **What's the business case threshold?** For example:
> - If AM part costs 2x traditional but arrives in 1 week vs 6 months, does that work financially?
> - If it eliminates $X/day downtime, what's the break-even AM cost premium?
> - Do you calculate total cost of ownership (TCO) or just upfront part cost?
>
> **How do you quantify value** of avoiding Arctic logistics delays?"

**Listen for:** Business case calculation, TCO approach, Arctic premium value

---

## Q4: Faster, Cheaper, or Better? (Finance Director Decision)

> "If you could change ONE thing about Agnico Eagle's Arctic spare parts system:
> - Make it **faster** (reduce lead times from X to Y)?
> - Make it **cheaper** (lower total logistics + inventory costs)?
> - Make it **better** (higher reliability, less equipment failure)?
>
> From a **finance perspective**, which delivers the highest ROI? And **how much would Agnico Eagle pay** to solve it?"

**Listen for:** Finance-driven priority, willingness to pay, ROI calculation

---

## Q5: Certification in Mining vs Oil & Gas (IF TIME)

> "Oil & gas operators say certification is their #1 barrier to AM adoption.
>
> Is mining similar, or are certification requirements different for:
> - Non-ATEX parts?
> - Equipment that doesn't interact with explosive atmospheres?
>
> **How much does mining AM certification cost vs oil & gas?** And **who pays** (Agnico, equipment OEMs, AM suppliers)?"

**Listen for:** Mining certification costs, comparative barrier analysis

---

## CRITICAL FOLLOW-UPS (Dig Deeper):

**If vague:** "Can you put a dollar figure on that? $X downtime/day? $Y logistics cost/part?"

**If "it varies":** "What's the range for typical vs critical parts?"

**If mentions "Arctic premium":** "What's the multiplier? 2x? 5x? 10x vs southern Canada logistics?"

**End:** "Who else in mining (Vale, BHP, Rio Tinto) should I talk to about Arctic/remote inventory challenges?"

---

## SUCCESS = Leave with:
✅ **Arctic downtime cost** ($$$ per day)  
✅ **Logistics premium** (Arctic vs standard shipping)  
✅ **Finance approval threshold** (ROI %, payback period)  
✅ **Business case model** (TCO calculation)  
✅ **Mining industry referrals** (remote operations contacts)
