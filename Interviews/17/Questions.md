# Interview Questions - Jean-Michel Fortin (Agnico Eagle)

**Name:** Jean-Michel Fortin, CPA  
**Title:** Directeur finance et services Nunavut (Finance Director, Nunavut Services)  
**Company:** Agnico Eagle (Gold Mining)  
**Location:** Nunavut operations (Canadian Arctic)  
**Meeting Date:** TBD  
**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Mining + Extreme Geographic Isolation)

**Context:** Agnico Eagle operates gold mines in Nunavut (Canadian Arctic)—one of the most remote and logistically challenging locations on Earth. Finance director perspective = business case focus, not just technical.

## QUESTION 1: Arctic Mining Inventory Challenges (Ultimate Geographic Isolation)

**Background:** All previous interviews mention geographic isolation as an adoption driver, but Nunavut takes this to the extreme: accessible only by air, Arctic winter limits resupply, nearest major city (Ottawa) is 1,500+ miles away.

**Question:**

> "Agnico Eagle's Nunavut operations seem to represent the most extreme version of supply chain challenges I've encountered:
> - **No road access** (fly-in only, or seasonal ice roads)
> - **Weather restrictions** (Arctic winter limits resupply)
> - **Remote location** (1,500+ miles from major suppliers)
> - **High transportation costs** (everything flown in)
>
> From a finance perspective, how does Agnico Eagle approach spare parts inventory for Arctic mine sites?
> - Do you pre-stock massive physical inventory to avoid shutdowns?
> - What % of operating costs is tied up in spare parts inventory and logistics?
> - When critical equipment fails and you need a part urgently, what's the process and cost?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Business case data:** Finance director can quantify inventory + logistics costs
- **Extreme use case:** If Arctic mines need digital inventory, everywhere does
- **ROI potential:** High transport costs = high potential savings from AM

**What You're Testing:**
- **NH.4 - Geographic Isolation:** Does Arctic validate this even more strongly?
- **Inventory cost quantification:** What % of budget is inventory/logistics?
- **Platform ROI:** Can digital inventory save millions in Arctic operations?

## QUESTION 2: Business Case for AM in Mining (Finance Perspective)

**Background:** Mark Kirby (Interview 9) said business case is the biggest barrier. Jean-Michel is a finance director—he makes business case decisions.

**Question:**

> "I keep hearing from AM experts that the technology works and certification is solvable, but the **business case** is what actually stops adoption at scale.
>
> From a finance director's perspective, if someone proposed installing additive manufacturing capability at an Agnico Eagle Arctic mine site, what would need to be in the business case for you to approve it?
> - Payback period threshold? (6 months? 2 years? 5 years?)
> - Minimum cost savings? (% of current inventory/logistics budget)
> - Risk mitigation value? (avoiding production downtime)
> - Other factors I'm not considering?
>
> And have you evaluated AM for Nunavut operations before? If so, what killed the business case?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Decision-maker insight:** He approves/rejects these investments (not theoretical)
- **Quantified thresholds:** Specific numbers (payback period, savings %)
- **Past failures:** If they evaluated AM and rejected it, learn why

**What You're Testing:**
- **Business case requirements:** What does platform need to prove to close sales?
- **Decision criteria:** Cost savings vs risk mitigation (which matters more?)
- **Platform pricing:** What price point fits within their approval threshold?

## QUESTION 3: Digital Inventory for Mining Equipment (Non-Structural Focus)

**Background:** Dr. Nasiri (Interview 11) emphasized non-structural, non-critical parts as entry point. Mining equipment has lots of support components (pumps, piping, conveyors) that aren't structural.

**Question:**

> "Mining equipment seems to have two categories of parts:
> - **Structural/critical:** Excavator buckets, haul truck frames, crusher components (high-stress, safety-critical)
> - **Non-structural/support:** Pump housings, piping connectors, conveyor idlers, chute liners, hydraulic fittings
>
> For the non-structural category, does it make sense to maintain digital inventory (CAD files + AM-on-demand) rather than physically stockpiling these parts in Nunavut?
>
> Especially considering Arctic logistics—flying in a $200 pump housing might cost $2,000 in freight, but printing it on-site from a CAD file could cost $300. Does that math work, or am I missing hidden costs?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Entry pathway:** Non-structural parts = lower risk, easier business case
- **Cost comparison:** Forces him to think through AM economics
- **Platform value:** Digital library of mining parts = clear value prop

**What You're Testing:**
- **NH.12 - Non-Structural Entry Point:** Does mining validate this framework?
- **Platform features:** Which mining parts should be in digital library?
- **ROI calculation:** Does freight cost > AM cost = automatic win?

## QUESTION 4: Cross-Industry Insights (Mining → Oil & Gas)

**Background:** Mining and offshore oil & gas have surprising overlap: remote operations, rotating workforce, heavy equipment, harsh environments.

**Question:**

> "Mining and offshore oil & gas seem to face similar challenges—remote sites, rotating workforce, heavy equipment maintenance, harsh environments.
>
> Have you seen any cross-pollination between industries on innovative approaches to spare parts inventory or rapid fabrication? For example:
> - Are offshore operators doing anything smart that mining should adopt?
> - Or is mining ahead in some areas (maybe better inventory tracking, predictive maintenance AI)?
>
> I'm trying to understand if lessons from one industry translate to the other, or if each operates in a silo."

**Why This Question:**
- **Thought leadership:** Connecting industries (shows strategic thinking)
- **Best practices:** What can each learn from the other?
- **Platform applicability:** One platform for mining + oil & gas + offshore?

**What You're Testing:**
- **Cross-industry platform:** Can same solution work for mining and oil & gas?
- **Feature differentiation:** Do industries need different features, or same core?
- **Market expansion:** Mining = third major sector after oil & gas and defense?

## FOLLOW-UP OPPORTUNITIES:

**If Jean-Michel mentions inventory costs are massive:**
> "Would you be open to sharing ballpark numbers—not proprietary, just order of magnitude? I'm trying to quantify the market opportunity. For example, is Arctic logistics 10% of operating budget, or more like 2%?"

**If Jean-Michel says business case threshold is strict (e.g., <2 year payback):**
> "That's helpful to know. If a digital inventory platform could demonstrate 18-month payback through reduced freight costs + avoided downtime, would that clear your approval threshold?"

**If Jean-Michel mentions they evaluated AM and rejected it:**
> "What would need to change—technology maturity, certification pathway, cost reduction, or something else—for you to reconsider AM for Nunavut operations?"

**If Jean-Michel is enthusiastic about non-structural parts:**
> "Could Agnico Eagle be a pilot partner? I could analyze your non-structural parts inventory, identify AM candidates, and build a business case with real Nunavut freight cost data. You'd get a roadmap, I'd get validation."

**At the end:**
> "Who else in Agnico Eagle should I talk to—operations team who manage equipment failures, procurement team who handle logistics, or engineering team who select parts? And are there other mining companies tackling Arctic logistics innovatively?"
