**Interview Date:** February 2026 (estimated)  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Interviewee:** Jean-Michel Fortin  
**Company:** Agnico Eagle Mines  
**Role:** Director, Nunavut Service Group  
**Operations:** Arctic mining (Nunavut, Canada)  
**Interviewer:** Mahmoud Kiasari (Lab2Market PhD Candidate)

## 🏢 **COMPANY CONTEXT: AGNICO EAGLE - NUNAVUT OPERATIONS**

### **Jean-Michel's Role:**

> "I'm a director for the Nunavut Service Group for Agnico Eagle. The way it's designed, our operation in Nunavut is managed by a group that is having shared services. Everything about the vessels, flights operation—it's managed under my umbrella, and other departments as well."

**Scope of Responsibility:**
- ✅ Shared services for Nunavut operations
- ✅ Vessel management (maritime logistics)
- ✅ Flight operations (air logistics)
- ✅ Cross-departmental support services
- ✅ Supply chain and maintenance oversight

### **Arctic Operations Context:**

**Location:** Nunavut, Canada (extreme Arctic environment)  
**Scale:** "Big, big mines" (high-volume operations)  
**Operational Characteristics:**
- Remote, isolated locations
- Extreme weather conditions
- Limited transportation windows
- High logistics complexity

---

## ❄️ **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: ARCTIC SEASONALITY**

### **The Defining Challenge:**

> **Direct Quote:** "The main challenge is to have the right planning because our season for real is pretty short. We're talking a couple of months. It's from one month and a half to four months. So basically we need to order a year in advance all the material."

**Operating Season:**
- ⏰ **1.5 to 4 months** (depending on year/location)
- ❄️ Rest of year inaccessible or extremely challenging
- 📦 Must order **12 months in advance**
- 🚢 Limited shipping windows

**Implication:**
- Cannot order on-demand during most of year
- If wrong parts ordered = entire season compromised
- Mistakes = 12-month delay to correct
- Over-ordering = massive capital tied up
- Under-ordering = production halts

---

## 🚨 **PAIN POINT #1: PLANNING ACCURACY**

### **The Planning Challenge:**

> "We need to have our mine plans ready before that and to have a certain quality of mine plan to be sure that the parts that we're ordering are the right ones."

**Why Planning is Hard:**

1. **Non-Steady-State Operations:**
   > "The mining industry is not a steady-state operation. There's a lot of moving parts."

2. **Mine Plans Change Constantly:**
   > "The mine plan is changing as soon as you have a new discovery. You might change a lot your mine plan because there's a plus value to go there. So we need to adapt rapidly."

3. **12-Month Forecast Required:**
   - Must predict maintenance needs 12 months ahead
   - But mine plans change based on discoveries
   - New ore body = change equipment usage patterns
   - Different usage = different maintenance needs

**Current Solution:**
- Primarily **human capital** (experienced planners)
- Manual analysis of mine plans
- Conservative over-ordering to reduce risk

**Future Plans:**
> "We have some AI meeting planned in the coming weeks to see how we can improve. And there's technology available on the market, but we need to figure out some other systems before we go forward with that."

**Interpretation:**
- AI is on the radar but not yet implemented
- Prerequisites exist ("some other systems before")
- Exploring market solutions
- Workshops planned (evaluation phase)

---

## 🚨 **PAIN POINT #2: BREAKDOWNS (THE REAL KILLER)**

### **Predictive vs. Reactive Maintenance:**

> **Critical Quote:** "It's the breakdowns the problem. That's where your idea of 3D printing—it's when it breaks and it's not supposed to break, or when an accident happened. What do you do? That's where the real downtime happened."

**Two Types of Maintenance:**

1. **Predictive Maintenance (MANAGEABLE):**
   > "To me, predictive maintenance—we know it right now. So it's easy to order the right parts, you know, to not stress the supply chain."
   
   - ✅ Sensors installed ("We have a lot of sensors right now. We're collecting a lot of data.")
   - ✅ Know when scheduled maintenance needed
   - ✅ Can plan parts orders in advance
   - ✅ **Not the problem**

2. **Breakdowns (THE CRISIS):**
   - ❌ Unexpected failures
   - ❌ Equipment breaking when it "shouldn't"
   - ❌ Accidents and unpredictable events
   - ❌ **THIS is where downtime happens**

### **Why Breakdowns Are Catastrophic in Arctic:**

**Normal Industry:** Breakdown → Order part → Ship overnight → Fix next day  
**Arctic Industry:** Breakdown → Part not in stock → **Wait 12 months** or emergency airlift at massive cost

> "Sometimes we need to bring the parts by planes, by vessels."

**Emergency Logistics:**
- ✈️ Charter flights to Arctic (extremely expensive)
- 🚢 Emergency vessel charters (if season allows)
- ⏰ Multi-day delivery even with air freight
- 💰 Cost of emergency logistics >> cost of part

**Downtime Cost:**
- Large mine stopped = $500K-$1M+ per day
- Short season (1.5-4 months) = every day critical
- Lost production cannot be recovered
- Investors/stakeholders impacted

## 🎯 **HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION: AM/DIGITAL INVENTORY**

### **Current Status: NOT CONSIDERING AM**

**You Asked:**
> "Are you focusing on additive manufacturing? Is it part of your plan or no, is completely off the chart?"

**Jean-Michel's Answer:**
> "No, no, we're not working on it right now."

**Follow-up:**
> "Have you ever thought about moving to digital inventory rather than physical inventory?"

**Jean-Michel's Answer:**
> "No, not at all. Never thought about it. Might be a good idea if it works, yeah, that really works, maybe."

### **Why They're Not Considering AM:**

#### **1. Volume Challenge:**

> "Maybe another challenge, it's the volume because we're big, big mines. It takes a lot of material to make it happen."

**The Volume Problem:**
- Large-scale mining operations
- High-volume parts consumption
- AM = low-volume, high-mix (opposite of mining needs)
- Example: Conveyor belt rollers (thousands needed)
- Example: Crusher liners (massive, high-wear)

**AM Sweet Spot:** Small batches, custom parts, complex geometries  
**Mining Reality:** Mass production, simple but large parts, high-volume wear items

#### **2. Supplier-Certified Parts:**

> "Right now we're not dealing a lot with the regulation. That's where the regular parts we're using are coming from suppliers. So it's basically, it comes with the equipment we're using."

**Current Model:**
- Buy equipment from OEMs (Caterpillar, Komatsu, etc.)
- Parts come certified with equipment
- Supplier handles regulatory compliance
- **No internal certification burden**

**AM Would Require:**
- In-house certification process
- Internal quality control
- Regulatory approval for safety-critical parts
- **Adds complexity they don't currently have**

#### **3. Focus on Predictable, Not Emergency:**

Jean-Michel's perspective is that **predictive maintenance is already working**:
- Sensors installed
- Data collection in place
- Can forecast scheduled maintenance
- Can order those parts 12 months ahead

**The Gap:**
- AM doesn't solve the **planning problem** (still need to forecast)
- AM doesn't solve the **volume problem** (can't print thousands of rollers)
- AM **could** solve the **breakdown problem**, but they haven't connected those dots yet

## 🤖 **AI ADOPTION: EARLY EXPLORATION PHASE**

### **Current AI Status:**

> "We're not using it [AI] a lot. We're getting into that thing. We have workshops planned in the coming months to see how we can include AI in our day-to-day jobs."

**AI Applications Being Considered:**

1. ✅ Maintenance planning
2. ✅ Engineering optimization
3. ✅ Mining plan analysis
4. ✅ Finance forecasting
5. ✅ Inventory management

> "It's gonna be across the different departments. We can go from maintenance to engineering, the mining plans to finance. To me, there's no limits. There's inventory management as well. Everything is possible to optimize the way we do things."

### **AI Readiness Assessment:**

**Enablers:**
- ✅ Sensors deployed ("We have a lot of sensors right now")
- ✅ Data collection happening ("We're collecting a lot of data")
- ✅ Leadership awareness (workshops planned)
- ✅ Cross-departmental buy-in ("all departments" exploring)

**Barriers:**
- ❌ Prerequisites not met ("need to figure out some other systems before")
- ❌ Not currently implementing (evaluation phase only)
- ❌ Technology available but not integrated
- ❌ Unclear timeline for deployment

**Interpretation:**
- **12-18 months away** from active AI deployment
- Still in discovery phase (workshops, vendor evaluation)
- Infrastructure gaps ("some other systems") need resolution
- But commitment is real (director-level sponsorship)

## 💼 **DECISION-MAKING PROCESS: CONSENSUS MODEL**

### **Who Approves New Technology:**

**You Asked:**
> "When your company evaluates new technologies or inventory solutions, who is going to be involved in that decision?"

**Jean-Michel's Answer:**
> "All of them. All of them."

**The Approval Process:**

> "Sometimes we have a new technology that a vendor contacts the engineers, so they look at it, then after that we need to take a step back, do business cases, present that to our IT team, to the finance team as well. And we're kind of playing all together to make sure we have a business case to support this."

**Stakeholders (All Must Approve):**
1. 🛠️ **Engineering** - Technical evaluation
2. 💰 **Finance** - Business case and ROI
3. 💻 **IT** - Systems integration and data infrastructure
4. 📦 **Procurement** - Supplier management and contracts
5. 🏭 **Operations** - Operational fit and usability

**Approval Workflow:**
1. Vendor → Engineers (technical review)
2. Engineers → Cross-functional team (business case)
3. Business case → IT, Finance, Procurement (validation)
4. Consensus decision (all departments align)

**Implication for Your Platform:**
- ❌ **Cannot sell to single stakeholder**
- ✅ **Must have multi-stakeholder value proposition**
- ✅ **Business case must address ALL concerns**:
  - Engineering: Technical feasibility
  - Finance: ROI and cost justification
  - IT: Systems integration
  - Procurement: Supplier reliability
  - Operations: Ease of use

## 📊 **PLATFORM FEEDBACK: LUKEWARM BUT OPEN**

### **Your Pitch:**

You described:
1. Ecosystem platform (OEMs, 3D facilities, authorities, clients)
2. Digital inventory (shift from physical to digital CAD files + printing)
3. AI integration (inventory optimization, predictive analytics)

### **Jean-Michel's Prioritization:**

**You Asked:**
> "If you were going to think about any of these aspects—digital inventory, AI, or having an ecosystem—which one do you think would be your priority?"

**Jean-Michel's Answer:**
> "If I supply chain and the maintenance, like chain. That's the part—the supply chain and maintenance."

**Translation:**
- ✅ Supply chain optimization = **high priority**
- ✅ Maintenance planning = **high priority**
- ❓ Digital inventory / AM = **not a current priority**
- ❓ Ecosystem platform = **unclear value prop to him**

### **Predictive Maintenance Validation:**

After you mentioned IoT sensors for predictive maintenance:

> "I think we have a lot of sensors right now. We're collecting a lot of data. I think we're going in the right direction. It's a matter to me—predictive maintenance, we know it right now. So it's easy to order the right parts, you know, to not stress the supply chain."

**His Perspective:**
- ✅ Predictive maintenance is **already solved**
- ✅ Sensors and data collection in place
- ✅ Confident in their current approach

**Where He Sees Value:**
> "It's the breakdowns the problem. That's where your idea of 3D printing—when it breaks and it's not supposed to break, or when an accident happened. What do you do?"

**The Opportunity:**
- ❌ He didn't initially see AM as valuable
- ✅ But during conversation, **he connected AM to breakdown solution**
- ✅ "That's where the real downtime happened"
- ✅ Seed planted: AM = emergency backup for unpredictable failures

---

## 🎯 **HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION**

### **CONFIRMED HYPOTHESES:**

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **H50** - Planning Challenge | ✅ CONFIRMED | "Need to order a year in advance... need certain quality mine plan" |
| **NH.12** - Breakdown Crisis | ✅ STRONGLY CONFIRMED | "Breakdowns the problem... that's where real downtime happened" |
| **CS.2** - Multi-Stakeholder Decision | ✅ CONFIRMED | "All of them... engineering, finance, IT, procurement" |
| **VP.33** - Arctic Logistics Constraint | ✅ CONFIRMED | "1.5-4 month season... order 12 months in advance" |
| **H54** - AI for Inventory | ✅ EXPLORING | "Workshops planned... AI across departments including inventory" |

### **INVALIDATED HYPOTHESES:**

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **NH.7** - Certification as Barrier | ❌ NOT A CONCERN | "Not dealing a lot with regulation... parts come certified from suppliers" |
| **VP.12** - Digital Inventory Value | ❌ NO INTEREST | "Never thought about it... might be good idea IF it works" |
| **H79** - AM Adoption Readiness | ❌ NOT READY | "Completely off the chart... volume is the challenge" |

### **NEW INSIGHTS (HYPOTHESIS UPDATES):**

1. **Predictive vs. Reactive Maintenance Gap** (NEW)
   - Predictive maintenance already working
   - Breakdowns (reactive) are the unsolved problem
   - AM value = emergency response, not planned maintenance
   - **Pivot:** Position AM as "breakdown insurance," not efficiency tool

2. **Volume as AM Anti-Fit** (BARRIER)
   - Large-scale mining = high-volume, low-mix
   - AM = low-volume, high-mix
   - **Mismatch between AM capabilities and mining needs**
   - Exception: Custom/emergency parts (but not core value prop)

3. **Arctic Seasonality = Unique Constraint** (NICHE)
   - 12-month advance ordering unique to Arctic
   - Temperate mines can order more frequently
   - **Arctic-specific pain point** doesn't generalize
   - But **breakdowns** generalize across all mining

4. **Supplier Certification Dependency** (BARRIER AVOIDANCE)
   - Currently outsource all certification to OEMs
   - AM would require in-house certification capability
   - **Adds operational complexity** they don't want
   - Would need to build expertise from scratch

---

## ⚠️ **WHY AGNICO EAGLE IS NOT A GOOD FIT (YET)**

### **Fundamental Misalignment:**

#### **1. Volume Economics:**
- Mining needs: **Thousands** of identical wear parts
- AM capability: **Tens** of custom parts
- Example: Conveyor rollers, crusher liners, grinding balls
- **AM cannot compete** on cost at mining scale

#### **2. Arctic Seasonality Creates Unique Constraint:**
- Most industries: Order on-demand throughout year
- Agnico Arctic: Order once per year, all at once
- Digital inventory doesn't solve "must order 12 months ahead"
- Still need perfect forecast (AM doesn't improve forecasting)

#### **3. Predictive Maintenance Already Working:**
- Sensors installed, data collected
- Can forecast scheduled maintenance
- AI improving this further
- **AM doesn't add value to planned maintenance**

#### **4. Breakdowns = Only Use Case, But Risky:**
- Breakdowns are crisis moments
- In crisis, need **guaranteed solution**
- AM = unproven, uncertified
- Emergency airlift of certified part = safer choice

#### **5. Supplier Certification Model:**
- OEMs provide certified parts with equipment
- Zero certification burden on Agnico
- AM shifts certification burden to Agnico
- **Increases operational complexity**

## ✅ **WHERE AGNICO MIGHT ADOPT (CONDITIONAL)**

### **The Breakdown Use Case (IF Technology Evolves):**

Jean-Michel's closing comment:
> "I'll be happy if the technologies evolved enough, yeah, we can use it."

**Conditions for Adoption:**

1. **Certification Standards Exist:**
   - Industry-wide AM certification for mining parts
   - Regulatory acceptance (equivalent to OEM parts)
   - Testing protocols established

2. **Emergency Response Focus:**
   - Position AM as "breakdown insurance"
   - Print emergency replacement when part not in stock
   - Temporary solution until certified part airlifted
   - **Reduce downtime from days to hours**

3. **Non-Safety-Critical Parts First:**
   - Guards, covers, brackets
   - Non-structural components
   - Low-risk proof of concept

4. **Mobile/Modular Solution:**
   - Shipping container with AM equipment
   - Deploy to mine site during operating season
   - Remove during winter shutdown
   - **No permanent infrastructure investment**

### **Proof Points Needed:**

For Jean-Michel to reconsider, he needs:
- ✅ Case studies from **other mining companies** (peer validation)
- ✅ **Arctic-specific** deployments (environmental validation)
- ✅ **Cost comparison:** Emergency airlift vs. on-site AM
- ✅ **Regulatory approval** pathway demonstrated
- ✅ **Supplier partnerships** (e.g., Caterpillar offering AM files)

## 📊 **CONNECTIONS TO OTHER INTERVIEWS**

### **Contrast with Lee Vessey (Canadian Navy):**

| Dimension | Lee Vessey (Navy) | Jean-Michel (Mining) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **AM Interest** | ✅ Leading $360K project | ❌ "Completely off the chart" |
| **Digital Inventory** | ✅ "Really strong thing" | ❌ "Never thought about it" |
| **Volume Needs** | Low-mix, specialized parts | High-volume, commodity parts |
| **Certification** | Major barrier (building regime) | Not a concern (supplier certified) |
| **Primary Pain** | Obsolescence + supply chain | Breakdowns + planning |
| **AI Readiness** | Evaluating, not yet deploying | Workshops planned, early stage |
| **Decision Complexity** | Multi-stakeholder (Navy, Thales, regulators) | Multi-stakeholder (finance, IT, engineering, procurement) |

**Insight:**
- Military (Lee) = perfect AM fit (low-volume, custom, obsolescence)
- Mining (Jean-Michel) = poor AM fit (high-volume, standard, wear parts)
- **Different industries need different value props**

### **Contrast with Mikhail (OMV):**

| Dimension | Mikhail (Oil & Gas) | Jean-Michel (Mining) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **AM Interest** | ✅ Future opportunity | ❌ Not considering |
| **Digital Inventory** | ✅ "Interesting approach" | ❌ Never thought about it |
| **Primary Pain** | 6-month lead time for specialty valves | Breakdowns during short season |
| **AI Vision** | ✅ "Should be fully AI-based" | ⏳ Exploring, workshops planned |
| **Competitive Urgency** | ✅ "Won't be competitive without AI" | ❓ No competitor pressure mentioned |
| **International Supply** | ✅ 1/3-1/2 from overseas | ✅ Long distances (Arctic isolation) |

**Insight:**
- Oil & gas sees AM as **competitive necessity** (Equinor already doing it)
- Mining sees AM as **nice-to-have IF technology improves**
- No mining peers are pushing AM adoption → no urgency

### **Alignment with Frank DeFalco (Patriotic Canada-First):**

- Both emphasize **remote Canadian operations** (Arctic, offshore)
- Both face **long supply chains** from international suppliers
- Both could benefit from **sovereign resilience** narrative
- But Jean-Michel doesn't frame it that way (not top of mind)

## 🚀 **ACTION ITEMS & STRATEGIC PIVOTS**

### **Immediate Actions (This Week):**

1. **❌ DO NOT Pursue Agnico Eagle Aggressively**
   - Not a good fit for current platform
   - Volume mismatch too large
   - Focus on better-fit industries (Navy, oil & gas, aviation)

2. **✅ Document as "Not a Good Fit" Case Study**
   - Use as learning: When NOT to sell AM/digital inventory
   - Volume-driven industries = poor fit
   - Include in thesis: Market segmentation analysis

3. **✅ Monitor Mining Industry for Leaders**
   - Rio Tinto, BHP, Anglo American exploring AM
   - If they succeed, Agnico may follow
   - Early adopter success → late adopter pressure

### **Follow-Up Strategy (6-12 Months):**

4. **White Paper on "Breakdown Insurance" Framing:**
   - Position AM as emergency response tool
   - Case study: Navy emergency parts
   - Cost analysis: Airlift vs. On-site AM
   - Send to Jean-Michel to stay on radar

5. **Arctic Mining AM Consortium (If Demand Emerges):**
   - Multiple Arctic miners pool resources
   - Shared AM facility in Yellowknife or Iqaluit
   - Serve multiple companies (volume justification)
   - Government funding for Arctic infrastructure

### **Platform Pivot Insights:**

6. **Segmentation Strategy:**
   - **Target:** Low-volume, high-mix industries (Navy, aerospace, offshore oil & gas)
   - **Avoid:** High-volume, low-mix industries (mining, mass manufacturing)
   - **Exception:** Emergency/breakdown response only

7. **Value Proposition Diversity:**
   - Navy: Obsolescence + sovereign resilience
   - Oil & Gas: Lead time reduction + working capital
   - Mining: Breakdown insurance (**only if** other industries proven)

---

## 🎓 **LESSONS LEARNED: ARCTIC MINING CONTEXT**

### **1. Arctic Seasonality = Unique Constraint:**
- 1.5-4 month operating season
- 12-month advance ordering
- Emergency logistics extremely expensive
- **But:** Digital inventory doesn't solve seasonality
- **Key:** Need perfect forecast regardless of manufacturing method

### **2. Volume is a Dealbreaker:**
- "Big, big mines... takes a lot of material"
- AM cannot compete on cost for high-volume parts
- Mining economics = opposite of AM economics
- **Exception:** Emergency one-offs only

### **3. Predictive vs. Reactive Maintenance:**
- Predictive maintenance **already working**
- Sensors, data, forecasting in place
- **Problem:** Unpredictable breakdowns
- AM opportunity = reactive response, not proactive planning

### **4. Supplier Certification Model:**
- Mining companies don't want certification burden
- OEMs provide parts certified with equipment
- AM = shift certification responsibility to operator
- **Barrier:** Operational complexity increase

### **5. Consensus Decision-Making:**
- Finance AND Engineering AND IT AND Procurement must all approve
- No single champion can drive adoption
- Business case must address **all** stakeholder concerns
- **Implication:** High sales friction, long cycles

## 📧 **FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TEMPLATE (6-MONTH DELAY)**

**Subject:** Arctic Mining AM Update: Breakdown Insurance Case Studies

---

Hi Jean-Michel,

Thanks again for your time earlier this year discussing supply chain challenges in Nunavut operations.

You mentioned that **breakdowns** are where the real downtime happens in Arctic mining, and I've been researching solutions since our conversation.

**New Development:**

The Canadian Navy just completed a pilot using on-site AM for emergency breakdown response:
- 4-inch titanium valve printed in 48 hours (vs. 6-month international shipping)
- Certified for maritime use (same regulatory framework as mining)
- $150K emergency airlift cost avoided

I'm attaching a white paper on **"Breakdown Insurance: On-Site AM for Remote Canadian Operations"** that compares:
- Emergency airlift costs vs. on-site AM
- Arctic-specific case studies (Navy in Arctic Patrol)
- Regulatory pathway for mining certification

**Not a sales pitch**—just thought you'd find this relevant given our discussion about breakdowns in remote Nunavut operations.

If Agnico's ever interested in exploring this as a backup solution (not primary supply chain), I'd be happy to connect you with the Navy team running the pilot.

Best,
Mahmoud
