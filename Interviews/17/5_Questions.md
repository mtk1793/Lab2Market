# Interview 17 - Jean-Michel Fortin (Agnico Eagle Mines)
## 5 QUESTIONS ONLY

**1. ARCTIC MINING OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES:**
"What are the biggest spare parts and logistics challenges for mining operations in remote Arctic locations? Where do current solutions fall short—lead times for critical equipment, transporting parts to remote sites, or managing inventory at multiple locations?"

**2. BUSINESS CASE FOR ARCTIC AM:**
"From a finance perspective, what would make AM compelling for non-structural mining parts in the Arctic? Is it about speed (getting parts faster), resilience (reducing dependency on long supply chains), or something else? What trade-offs are acceptable?"

**3. DECISION-MAKING FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES:**
"When Agnico evaluates new technologies or inventory solutions, who's involved in that decision—operations, procurement, finance, engineering? What makes a business case compelling enough to approve? How do corporate priorities differ from what mine sites need day-to-day?"

**4. MINING VS OIL & GAS CERTIFICATION:**
"Is certification a major barrier in mining like it is in oil & gas? How do mining standards differ? For non-ATEX parts, what's the approval process—internal engineering review, third-party certification, or equipment OEM validation?"

**5. DIGITAL INVENTORY FOR REMOTE OPERATIONS:**
"Imagine a digital platform that helps identify which parts are AM candidates, connects you to qualified suppliers, and streamlines the approval process for remote sites. What would make that valuable to Agnico's Arctic operations? What concerns or barriers would you anticipate?"
