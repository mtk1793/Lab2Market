## What We're Testing

### Primary Hypothesis
**"Offshore operators and maritime companies struggle with (1) finding certified AM suppliers and (2) proving compliance with certification bodies. Lloyd's Register could be a critical integration partner, and operators would be willing customers."**

### Key Questions
1. **Do operators actually struggle with supply chain + certification?** (Validate pain from LR perspective)
2. **Is Lloyd's Register ready to partner/integrate?** (Test partnership feasibility)
3. **Who are the operator decision-makers?** (Identify customer access)
4. **What would digital certification integration look like?** (Test technical viability)
5. **Who else is competing in this space?** (Understand competitive landscape)

## Success Looks Like...

✅ **Best case:** Trevor validates operator pain, expresses partnership interest, makes operator intros, confirms LR could integrate certification data

😐 **Good case:** Trevor acknowledges pain and partnership potential, offers to explore internally, some operator connections

❌ **Poor case:** Trevor skeptical of demand, unwilling to partner, protective of relationships

## Key Talking Points for the Call

**Opening frame:**
"I've been validating a supply chain platform that connects operators with certified AM suppliers. Since you work with major offshore operators and understand Lloyd's Register's certification role, I think your perspective would be really valuable."

**Core ask:**
"Would Lloyd's Register be interested in integrating with or endorsing a platform that helps operators find certified suppliers and provides real-time visibility into certifications?"

**Why this matters to LR:**
- Streamlines certification workflows for clients
- Differentiates LR from other classification societies
- Positions LR as innovation leader in offshore energy
- Creates partnership revenue opportunities
