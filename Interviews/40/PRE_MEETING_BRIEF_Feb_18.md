# Trevor Butler Pre-Meeting Brief
**Lloyd's Register — Certification Body Partnership Discussion**

**Date:** February 18, 2026 (Tomorrow)
**Time:** 1000 Atlantic Time
**Location:** TBD (virtual or in-person)
**Attendees:** Trevor Butler, Dave Whitehouse, Adam Saxty (Lloyd's Register)
**Your Objective:** Validate certification body partnership model + identify operator access pathway

---

## Executive Summary

**The Core Opportunity:** Lloyd's Register is THE certification authority for maritime and offshore operations. A partnership—even just an endorsement—gives AddManuChain credibility with operators and accelerates Navy adoption. But first, you need to understand:
1. Do operators actually struggle with supply chain + certification integration?
2. Is Lloyd's Register open to integration/partnership?
3. Can they connect you to offshore operators facing this problem?

**Meeting Success Indicator:** You leave with at least one confirmed operator introduction OR clarity on what Lloyd's Register would need to formally partner.

## Your Strategic Frame

### What You're Asking For (Implicit)
You're not asking for anything—you're asking about them.

**Conversation Arc:**
1. **Their world first** — "Help me understand the operator pain points you see"
2. **Validation** — "Here's how others are solving this"
3. **Their role** — "Where do you see Lloyd's Register fitting?"
4. **Mutual value** — "How could this help you and your clients?"
5. **Next steps** — "Who should we talk to next?"

This is **inbound methodology**, not sales. You're gathering intelligence with genuine curiosity.

## Critical Intelligence from Other Interviews

### From Aaron Plamondon (Irving Shipbuilding — Feb 13)
**Key Finding:** Navy AM adoption is completely blocked by a leadership decision that hasn't been made—but Feb 18 Admiral visit to Dalhousie could change this.

**How This Affects Your Meeting:**
- If Navy approves AM, operators will need to source certified AM parts quickly
- Lloyd's Register certification will be a bottleneck or enabler depending on their readiness
- **Talking point:** "Aaron at Irving mentioned the Navy is about to make a decision on AM adoption. If they do, what happens to your certification workflow?"

### From David Haire (CME NL — Feb 16)
**Key Finding:** 85% of manufacturers not connected to Canada Makes; massive ecosystem gap. Metal AM ROI requires service provider model (Atlantic XL manufacturing, not end-user owning equipment).

**How This Affects Your Meeting:**
- Operators don't buy AM machines—they buy AM parts from service providers
- Lloyd's Register needs to certify AM service providers, not manufacturers
- **Talking point:** "We're seeing that operators source AM parts from centralized providers like Atlantic XL, not manufacture in-house. This shifts the certification question—you'd be certifying service providers, not end-users."

### From Week 7 Mentor Panel
**Shelley Hesshen (IP Counsellor):** "Don't talk about your IP publicly until you've protected it."
- Keep quiet about your digital integration roadmap until you understand LR's openness

**David Thomas (The Pier):** "Validate first. Build second. Know your first customer."
- Your first validated customer might be an operator introduced by Trevor

**Paul Blemer (Strategic Advisor):** "Go one level deeper. Use innovative thinking to ask questions that reveal the innovation space."
- Example: Don't just ask "Do you have supply chain problems?" Ask: "When equipment goes down unexpectedly, how do you source the replacement part? What's the approval process?"

**Sheila Patterson (Offshore Wind):** "Offshore wind is a green field. There's an opportunity to embed innovative solutions from the start."
- **Critical insight:** Offshore wind is being built NOW, supply chain being designed NOW. If LR is involved, you want to be part of this opportunity.

## Meeting Objectives (Rank Order)

### PRIMARY (Must achieve)
**1. Validate Operator Pain**
- Ask about real supply chain + certification challenges from LR's portfolio
- Listen for: parts lead times, downtime costs, supplier vetting, approval processes
- Red flag: If they say supply chain isn't a concern, pivot to understand their view

**2. Test Partnership Interest**
- Ask if LR would consider integration/endorsement of a platform that connects operators with certified suppliers
- Listen for: willingness to share certification data, strategic fit, next steps
- Red flag: If they say this is "outside LR's core business," you'll need to reframe

**3. Understand Certification Workflow**
- Ask how certification currently works end-to-end
- Listen for: friction points, time delays, documentation burdens
- Use this to understand where platform adds value

### SECONDARY (Nice to achieve)
**4. Operator Access**
- Ask if Trevor would introduce you to decision-makers at Equinor, ExxonMobil, other operators
- Listen for: willingness + which operators he works with
- Red flag: "I can't introduce my clients" = he sees you as a competitor threat

**5. Competitive Intelligence**
- Ask who else is digitizing certification or connecting operators to suppliers
- Listen for: gaps in market, differentiation opportunities
- Use this to calibrate your unique positioning

## Pre-Meeting Preparation

### 30 Minutes Before Meeting
**Review these three things:**

1. **Your one-liner**
   - "I'm building a digital platform that connects operators with certified local suppliers—combining supply chain visibility with certification integration. I want to understand whether this solves real operator problems from Lloyd's Register's perspective."

2. **Your five main questions** (from Interview #40)
   - Q1: Operator pain points (supply chain + certification)
   - Q2: Certification workflow (where are bottlenecks?)
   - Q3: Platform integration potential (would you partner/integrate/endorse?)
   - Q4: Operator introductions (can you connect us?)
   - Q5: Competitive landscape (who else is solving this?)

3. **Talking points** (backed by other interviews)
   - "Aaron Plamondon at Irving mentioned Navy may be about to approve AM adoption—if that happens, operators will need fast certification pathways for AM parts"
   - "In my interviews with manufacturers, I'm seeing the ROI barrier isn't the technology—it's proving that parts meet certification standards"
   - "Operators seem to be under post-pandemic pressure to build more resilient, distributed supply chains"

### What NOT To Do
- ❌ Don't talk about your platform roadmap in detail—you're still validating
- ❌ Don't ask for investment or formal partnership yet—you're gathering intelligence
- ❌ Don't be defensive if they're skeptical—skepticism = honest feedback
- ❌ Don't over-explain—ask questions, listen, take notes

### What TO Do
- ✅ Ask follow-up questions ("Can you give me a specific example?")
- ✅ Show genuine curiosity (this is their domain, not yours)
- ✅ Take detailed notes on operator names, pain points, certification bottlenecks
- ✅ Acknowledge good points ("That's helpful. I hadn't thought about it that way.")

## The Three Attendees

### Trevor Butler — Your Primary Contact
- **Role:** Business Development Manager - Offshore Energy
- **Background:** 19+ years at Lloyd's Register, naval engineering background
- **Authority:** Can speak on behalf of LR, authorized to explore partnerships
- **Leverage:** Deep relationships with offshore operators

**Approach:** Respect his expertise. He knows maritime/offshore better than you. Your job is to understand his world, not convince him.

### Dave Whitehouse — TBD
- **Title:** Unknown (Possibly sales, partnerships, or product)
- **Why here:** Trevor invited him, likely because he has authority or relevant expertise
- **Approach:** Treat him as decision-maker. Listen to what he cares about.

### Adam Saxty — TBD
- **Title:** Unknown (Possibly technical, product, or partnerships)
- **Why here:** Trevor invited him, likely relevant to integration/partnership feasibility
- **Approach:** If he's technical, he'll care about API requirements and data security. Be ready to discuss.

**Note:** You don't know exactly why Dave and Adam are there. That's okay. In the meeting, they'll reveal their authority and interests through questions. Listen for:
- Do they ask about technical feasibility? → They're thinking about integration
- Do they ask about operators? → They're thinking about market fit
- Do they ask about timeline? → They're thinking about prioritization

## Anticipated Responses & How To React

### If They Say: "Yes, operators struggle with parts lead times and certification"
**You respond:** "That's what I'm hearing from my interviews too. When an operator needs an urgent part, walk me through what happens. How long does certification take? Who's involved?"
**Then:** Use this to understand the bottleneck so you can design the platform correctly.

### If They Say: "We'd be interested in a partnership"
**You respond:** "That's great. What would that partnership look like? Would you want to integrate with our platform, endorse it, or something else?"
**Then:** Don't commit to anything. Say you want to continue validating the idea with other operators first.

### If They Say: "We can introduce you to operators we work with"
**You respond:** "That would be invaluable. Which operators should I talk to first? What challenges do they face that you think we could help solve?"
**Then:** Get specific names, email contacts, and context before you leave.

### If They Say: "This is outside Lloyd's Register's focus"
**You respond:** "I understand. From your perspective as a certification body working with operators, do you think operators would value this type of platform?"
**Then:** Pivot away from LR partnership. Focus on operator validation instead.

### If They Say: "We have concerns about data security/confidentiality"
**You respond:** "That makes total sense. What security standards would be required? What would we need to put in place?"
**Then:** Take detailed notes. This becomes a design requirement.

## During the Meeting: Your Roles

### You Are
✅ **A student** — learning how certification bodies and operators work
✅ **A problem-solver** — trying to understand what's broken
✅ **A connector** — bringing different parts of the ecosystem together
✅ **Genuinely curious** — not trying to sell, trying to understand

### You Are NOT
❌ A salesman (don't pitch unless asked)
❌ A Lloyd's Register expert (you're not; they are)
❌ A representative of Navy/government (you're independent)
❌ Committed to any specific direction yet (you're validating)

## Key Phrases That Build Trust

**Ask the same way Paul Blemer suggests** (go one level deeper):

Instead of: "Do operators struggle with supply chain?"
Ask: "When an operator needs an urgent part, walk me through what actually happens. Who gets involved? How long does it take?"

Instead of: "Would you integrate with our platform?"
Ask: "How do you currently share certification data with operators? What would need to change if you wanted to streamline that?"

Instead of: "Can you introduce us to operators?"
Ask: "Which of your operator clients are actively trying to modernize their supply chains? Who should I talk to?"

## After the Meeting: Within 24 Hours

- [ ] Send thank-you email to Trevor, Dave, Whitehouse, Adam
- [ ] Reference specific points they mentioned (shows you listened)
- [ ] If they offered to introduce operators, follow up on timing/contact info
- [ ] If they expressed partnership interest, propose next steps
- [ ] Update your hypothesis tracking with validation from this meeting
- [ ] Share intelligence with your core team (Aaron, David Haire, mentors)

## Success Looks Like

**Great Outcome:**
- ✅ Trevor validates strong operator pain points
- ✅ LR is open to integration/endorsement discussion
- ✅ You leave with 2-3 operator contact introductions
- ✅ Next meeting scheduled with LR product/digital team

**Good Outcome:**
- ✅ Trevor confirms operator supply chain challenges are real
- ✅ LR is interested but cautious (wants to see more validation)
- ✅ You leave with 1-2 operator contacts
- ✅ Clear understanding of what LR would need to partner

**Acceptable Outcome:**
- ✅ Trevor acknowledges supply chain/certification integration as interesting
- ✅ LR open to staying in touch as you validate more
- ✅ You understand certification workflow and operator landscape better
- ✅ You can approach operators independently without LR intro

**Poor Outcome:**
- ❌ Trevor sees no operator demand for this
- ❌ LR unwilling to consider partnership
- ❌ No operator introductions offered
- ❌ No path forward with Lloyd's Register

## Your Backup Plays (If Partnership Doesn't Happen)

If Lloyd's Register isn't willing to partner, you have alternatives:

1. **Approach operators directly** (via LinkedIn, industry conferences, referrals)
2. **Partner with certification authority on the OPERATOR side** (not LR itself)
3. **Start with smaller operators** who are more agile than major energy companies
4. **Focus on Navy adoption first** (if Feb 18 Admiral visit is successful)
5. **Build without LR integration initially**, then add it later once operators validate demand

But don't reveal this backup plan in the meeting. Keep focus on understanding their perspective.

## One Final Thought

Trevor Butler is a business development manager at a major certification society. He's probably seen dozens of startups pitch digital solutions. You're different because:

1. You're not asking for anything (yet)
2. You're backed by real customer research (38+ interviews)
3. You're solving a problem operators actually face (not a nice-to-have)
4. You're thinking about the ecosystem, not just your platform

Walk in curious, not confident. Listen more than you talk. Let them feel like they're helping you understand their world.

That's how you build trust with industry gatekeepers.
