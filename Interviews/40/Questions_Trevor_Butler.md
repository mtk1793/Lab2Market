## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: Offshore Energy Operator Pain Points & Supply Chain Challenges 🌊

**"From your experience at Lloyd's Register working with offshore oil & gas operators and marine customers, what are the biggest operational and supply chain challenges they face? Specifically, have you heard about issues with spare parts availability, lead times, quality assurance, or managing certified suppliers?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates pain from certification body POV**: Do LR's clients struggle with supply chain?
- **Tests market demand in offshore**: Is this a top-5 pain point or niche concern?
- **Identifies willing operators**: Which of LR's clients would be interested in a solution?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Spare parts pain**: "Operators constantly complain about parts taking 8-16 weeks"
- ✅ **Certification burden**: "Proving parts meet LR and regulatory standards is time-consuming"
- ✅ **Quality assurance**: "Operators struggle to verify AM parts meet traditional material specs"
- ✅ **Distributed sourcing**: "Operators use multiple suppliers and have no central visibility"
- ✅ **Downtime cost justification**: "Equipment downtime costs operators $500K-$2M per day"
- ✅ **Compliance proof**: "Operators need digital proof of certification for offshore operations"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Supply chain isn't a major concern for our clients"

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which offshore operators have the worst supply chain challenges?"
- "Do operators ever ask Lloyd's Register for help sourcing or vetting suppliers?"
- "How often does equipment failure create emergency parts procurement situations?"
- "What percentage of downtime is due to parts availability vs. other factors?"
- "Have you heard operators mention AM as a potential solution?"
