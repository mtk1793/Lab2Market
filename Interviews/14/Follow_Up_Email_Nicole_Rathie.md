Hi Nicole,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the Canadian manufacturing ecosystem and your work at NGen and Canada Makes. Your insights on supply chain opacity and IP protection were incredibly valuable.

## Key Takeaways

Three things from our conversation are directly shaping my platform development:

**1. Canadian Supply Chain Visibility Challenge**

Your point about **"Canadians traveling to Frankfurt to meet each other"** (Frank's quote) perfectly captures the problem my platform aims to solve. The fact that NGen is actively working on connecting 8,000+ SMEs across Canada validates that this is a real, systemic issue—not just isolated pain points.

**2. Select AM's On-Premise Architecture**

This was the single most actionable insight from our conversation. The fact that **"CAD files don't leave the person's computer"** and this approach was **"adopted by big heavy hitters"** is exactly the IP protection model I need to implement. I'm now designing the platform architecture around this principle:

- ✅ On-premise CAD processing (files never uploaded to cloud)
- ✅ API-based connections (platform brokers, but never sees files)
- ✅ Zero-knowledge architecture (technically impossible to steal IP)

This solves the **"people will hide behind IP"** barrier you identified.

**3. Government Anchor Tenant Strategy**

Your insight that **"everyone would buy in if the Canadian defense sector is involved"** is a brilliant solution to the two-sided marketplace chicken-and-egg problem. I'm actively pursuing this through the Thales/Canadian Navy AM project (Lee Vessey interview) as the anchor customer.

## Assembly PEI Connection

I'd love to connect with Michelle at Assembly PEI as you suggested. Since we're both working on digital inventory in the additive space, there could be synergies or complementary capabilities to explore. I'll reach out to you separately for the introduction.

## Applying Your Feedback

Based on our conversation, here's how I'm pivoting:

**Platform Architecture:**
- Adopting Select AM's on-premise model (no cloud file uploads)
- Files stay with customer, platform facilitates connections only

**Go-to-Market:**
- Targeting defense sector first (DND anchor = ecosystem unlock)
- Post-pilot expansion to broader manufacturing (leveraging NGen network)

**Timing:**
- Acknowledging current geopolitical wait-and-see mindset
- Building product now, heavy sales push post-uncertainty (late 2026)

## Thank You

Your candor about the challenges (IP protection, two-sided marketplace dynamics, current uncertainty) was exactly what I needed. It's easy to find people who say "great idea"—much harder to find people who identify the real obstacles. That's what validates I'm working on the right problem.
