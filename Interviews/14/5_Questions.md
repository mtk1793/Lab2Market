# Interview 14 - Nicole Rathie (NGen)
## 5 QUESTIONS ONLY

**1. MANUFACTURING ECOSYSTEM CHALLENGES:**
"From your work with 5,000+ NGen members, what are the biggest operational pain points you're hearing about? Where do manufacturers struggle most—finding the right suppliers, identifying which parts to make vs buy, or managing inventory across multiple facilities?"

**2. AI ADOPTION IN MANUFACTURING:**
"You've helped manufacturers adopt AI tools. What separates the AI platforms that actually get used from the ones that don't? Is it ease of use, trust in the technology, or something else? What would make an AI tool irresistible to your members?"

**3. CANADA MAKES SELECT AM EXPERIENCE:**
"What's been your experience with Canada Makes' Select AM platform? If you could redesign it to better serve manufacturers, what would you focus on—making it more intuitive, adding new capabilities, or integrating it with other tools they already use?"

**4. DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM VISION:**
"Imagine a platform that connects manufacturers, designers, AM facilities, and certification bodies in one ecosystem—like a digital marketplace for on-demand parts. What would make that valuable to NGen members? What concerns or barriers would you anticipate?"

**5. NGEN PARTNERSHIP & PILOT OPPORTUNITIES:**
"For startups building AI-driven platforms for manufacturing, what's the best path to work with NGen—pilot projects with select members, integration into existing programs, or something else? Would there be interest in testing an AI platform that helps manufacturers identify AM opportunities and connect with qualified suppliers?"
