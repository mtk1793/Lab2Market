## QUESTION 1: Manufacturing Inventory Costs & Current Solution (Carol's Critical Question)

**Background:** Carol's guidance: "How are they solving it today? How much are they paying to solve it today?"

**Question:**

> "Before we dive into AI and digital tools, I'd love to understand the current state for NGen member companies:
>
> - **What's the cost of inventory management for typical Canadian manufacturers?** For example:
>   - How much do companies spend on warehouse space, inventory carrying costs, obsolete parts write-offs?
>   - What does it cost when a production line stops because a critical part isn't in inventory?
> - **How are manufacturers solving spare parts management today?** Large warehouses? Just-in-time ordering? Something else?
> - **What's the minimum solution most companies are using?** (spreadsheets? ERP systems? manual tracking?)
> - **Have you quantified the problem?** For instance, if better inventory optimization could cut carrying costs by 20% across NGen's 5,000 members, what would that aggregate savings be?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Carol's mandate:** Quantify current cost to establish baseline value
- **Market sizing:** 5,000 NGen members × cost savings = TAM calculation
- **Problem validation:** Is inventory a $$ pain point or just inconvenience?

**What You're Testing:**
- **Market size:** How much $$$ do manufacturers waste on inventory inefficiency?
- **Current solution cost:** Baseline to measure platform value against
- **Pain level:** Big enough problem to pay for solution?

## QUESTION 2: Buyer Identification for Manufacturing Innovation Tools (Carol's Critical Question)

**Background:** Carol's guidance: "Who is willing to pay you? Where's the money coming from? Is end user = buyer?"

**Question:**

> "I'm trying to understand how manufacturers make purchasing decisions for innovation tools:
>
> - **Who typically pays for digital transformation tools at NGen member companies?** Is it:
>   - Operations budget (plant managers)?
>   - IT budget (CTO/CIO)?
>   - Innovation/R&D budget?
> - **Is the end user (plant floor managers tracking inventory) the same as the buyer (person signing the check)?**
> - **What ROI threshold do they need to approve purchase?** For example:
>   - Payback period (6 months? 12 months? 24 months?)
>   - Cost savings percentage (10%? 20%? 30%?)
> - **NGen funding vs self-funded:** Do companies expect NGen to subsidize innovation tools, or will they pay directly if value is clear?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Carol's mandate:** "Where's the money coming from?"
- **Buyer persona:** Identify decision-maker at manufacturing companies
- **Pricing strategy:** Understand approval thresholds

**What You're Testing:**
- **Willingness to pay:** Will manufacturers pay for platform, or expect free/subsidized?
- **Decision unit:** Operations vs IT vs Innovation budget dynamics
- **Sales cycle:** How long does purchasing decision take?

## QUESTION 3: Select AM Tool - What's Missing? (Competitive Advantage)

**Background:** Carol's guidance: "Can you do it faster/cheaper/better?" Need to understand Select AM gaps to differentiate.

**Question:**

> "Frank mentioned Canada Makes has the 'Select AM' tool for part suitability analysis:
>
> - **What's working well with Select AM that I should NOT try to duplicate?**
> - **What's the biggest user complaint or feature request?** For example:
>   - Doesn't address certification pathways?
>   - No ROI calculator (can't prove business case)?
>   - Doesn't integrate with ERP/inventory systems?
> - **If you could change ONE thing about Select AM to 10x adoption, what would it be?**
>   - Make it **faster** (easier data input, instant results)?
>   - Make it **cheaper** (free for all vs current pricing)?
>   - Make it **better** (add features: certification, ROI calc, AI optimization)?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Competitive positioning:** Find gap between Select AM and market need
- **Partnership opportunity:** Could build missing features and integrate?
- **Differentiation:** Focus platform on what Select AM doesn't do

**What You're Testing:**
- **Market gap:** What stops Select AM from wide adoption?
- **Feature prioritization:** Which missing feature drives most value?
- **Integration potential:** Build standalone or integrate with Select AM?

## QUESTION 4: NGen Ecosystem & Partnership Opportunities

**Background:** NGen connects 5,000+ manufacturers across Canada. Potential platform distribution channel.

**Question:**

> "NGen has an incredible network of manufacturers across Canada. As I develop this digital inventory + AM platform, I'm thinking about go-to-market strategy.
>
> For startups building tools for the manufacturing sector, what's the most effective way to reach NGen members?
> - Direct sales to individual companies?
> - Partnership with NGen/Canada Makes (platform offered as cluster resource)?
> - Pilot projects with NGen-funded initiatives?
>
> And candidly, what mistakes do early-stage platforms make when trying to work with your ecosystem?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Distribution strategy:** NGen could provide access to 5,000+ potential customers
- **Funding opportunity:** NGen funds innovation projects (platform development grant?)
- **Credibility:** NGen endorsement = validation for manufacturers

**What You're Testing:**
- **Partnership model:** How to structure collaboration with NGen?
- **Pilot opportunity:** Could Nicole sponsor pilot with NGen member company?
- **Funding pathway:** Does platform qualify for NGen technology development funding?

## FOLLOW-UP OPPORTUNITIES:

**If Nicole mentions Select AM tool has low adoption:**
> "What would make companies more likely to use it? Better UI? Integration with their ERP systems? ROI calculator? I'm trying to understand what converts *awareness* into *action*."

**If Nicole mentions certification as a gap in Select AM:**
> "That's exactly what I'm hearing from offshore operators—they can identify suitable parts, but then hit a certification wall. Would NGen be interested in a certification pathway module that integrates with Select AM?"

**If Nicole is enthusiastic about AI features:**
> "Would you be open to a pilot? I could work with 1-2 NGen member companies to validate the AI inventory optimization, and NGen would get case study data for the broader network."

**If Nicole mentions specific manufacturers struggling with inventory:**
> "Could you introduce me? I'm looking for 2-3 pilot partners to test the platform, and companies already engaged with NGen would be ideal because they understand the AM landscape."

**At the end:**
> "Frank spoke very highly of your expertise. As I continue customer discovery, who else in the NGen ecosystem should I talk to—either on the technology side (AI, AM) or industry side (operators with large inventories)?"
