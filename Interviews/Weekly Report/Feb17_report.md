Report Date: February 17, 2026
Compiled by: Michael Kiasari

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Total Interviews Analyzed: 8 completed interviews (#29-35, #39)
Interview Period: February 11-16, 2026
Overall Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXTRAORDINARY — Multiple game-changing insights

TOP 3 STRATEGIC BREAKTHROUGHS:
FIRST QUANTITATIVE DATA: $4-5M inventory for $50M utility (Adam Chubbs), $30-50M/vessel for offshore drilling (Jason Power validated)
"AEROSPACE FIRST" STRATEGY: Hardest certification first → unlocks all O&G markets (Shawn Sooley)
PERMISSION CIRCLE: Value + Capability proven; only Permission (certification) blocks adoption (Tyler Beatty - ExxonMobil)
INTERVIEW #29: DARREN WOOD — PROAX TECHNOLOGIES ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Date: February 11, 2026
Role: Distribution specialist, industrial automation
Rating: 9/10 — CRITICAL network access + obsolescence validation

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Obsolescence Pain ("All the Time")

15-20 year install bases = obsolescence threshold
Real example: HMI screen no longer exists
Traceability loss: distributors don't always know where parts go
2. Emergency Logistics Reality

10-day emergency delivery for Central Newfoundland motor
Standard ground (NL): 5 days from ON/QC
Human error bypasses automation on rush orders
3. Inventory Management Paradox

Forward-thinking customers stock spares
Cost-conscious customers "roll the dice"
Distributor challenge: "What should we keep in stock?"
4. ERP Integration Exists BUT:

Standard catalog parts work fine
Build-to-order parts = major gap
Trump tariffs creating supply chain chaos
5. AM Reception: "That stuff is very interesting. I mean, I'd love it."

Validates custom fabricated parts use case
Robot end-effector tooling example (Teflon/Delrin ring)
Value-add team already exploring AM
QUANTITATIVE DATA:
Metric	Value
Obsolescence frequency	"All the time"
Install base age (risk)	15-20 years
Emergency delivery (real)	10 days
Standard ground (NL)	5 days
Proax locations (Canada)	13
WARM REFERRALS UNLOCKED (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐):
Mark Gillingham (Poly Unity) — AM ecosystem leader Atlantic Canada
Robert Hines (Kraken Robotics) — Custom AUV parts, pilot customer potential
David Hare (CMA) — Industry association access
INTERVIEW #30: ADAM CHUBBS — FROBISHER ENERGY / ECOTEX / ENGINEERED INTELLIGENCE ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Date: February 11, 2026
Role: Utilities, Arctic operations, AI asset intelligence
Rating: 9/10 — FIRST quantitative data + AI partnership opportunity

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. FIRST QUANTITATIVE INVENTORY DATA 💰

$4-5M inventory for $50M utility (8-10% ratio)
Single transformer: $100K
Single turbo: $200K (+ preservation costs)
Pareto principle: 10% of inventory = 90% of cost
2. Arctic Logistics Amplification

Summer: Sealift from Montreal (low cost)
Winter: Air freight ONLY ("increase costs big time")
Peak load failures in winter = worst case (demand + logistics)
3. N+2 Redundancy in Remote Mining

Diamond/gold mines: N+2 (1 running, 1 standby, 1 maintenance)
Utilities: N+1
Transformer spares: 5% of fleet
4. CERTIFICATION BREAKTHROUGH: Utilities Self-Certify

"We don't have to buy CSA certified equipment"
"We don't look for that sticker"
Non-public environments = lower barrier
MAJOR INSIGHT: Certification barrier LOWER than expected for utilities/offshore
5. AI + DIGITAL TWINS OPPORTUNITY 🤖

Engineered Intelligence (Adam's company) — Platform: "Engine" (e-n-g-e-I-n)
Problem: Data silos ("trolls of maintenance data... no one can piece it together")
Use cases: Predict failures, predict overloads, weather correlation
Enamcos: Digital twins for offshore subsea equipment
6. On-Site Fabrication Already Accepted

Utilities have own machine shops
"Fabrication on site of your own stuff is not it's not uncommon"
Cultural barrier is LOW — already trust locally fabricated parts
QUANTITATIVE DATA:
Metric	Value
Inventory value (utility)	$4-5M
Inventory-to-asset ratio	8-10%
Transformer cost	$100K
Turbo cost	$200K
Transformer spare ratio	5% of fleet
Mining redundancy	N+2
PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY:
Engineered Intelligence — Integrate digital inventory with AI asset intelligence (closed-loop: AI predicts → inventory triggers → AM produces)

INTERVIEW #31: MIKE PAULIN — C-CORE / MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Date: February 12, 2026
Role: 37-year Arctic offshore pipeline engineer
Rating: 8/10 — Arctic validation + certification pathway clarified

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Arctic Access Windows Create Stranding

Open water: Boat ✅
Solid ice: Vehicle/sled ✅
Ice formation/breakup: STRANDED (helicopter only, expensive, weather-dependent) ❌
2. Downtime Economics Formula

Production rate × oil price = daily loss
Range: $0 (minor) → 100,000 bbl/day × $70 = $7M/day (full shutdown)
3. Gulf of Mexico Cooperative Model Validates Platform Concept

Physical spare parts cooperatives already exist
Draw-and-replace system
AddManuChain = digital version of this proven model
4. CERTIFICATION PATHWAY CLARIFIED ⚖️

C-CORE ≠ Certification body (design validation only)
DNV / Lloyd's / ABS = actual certification authorities
Testing hierarchy: Certifying authority defines requirements → C-CORE/Memorial/NRC perform tests → Submit results → Certification issued
5. AM "Bridge Parts" Strategy

Operators will accept shorter-life AM parts as temporary fix
"Maybe it doesn't have as long of life, but you accept that... until you can get the OEM piece"
Position as emergency bridge, not permanent replacement
6. Bay du Nord Intelligence

$10B project, 1000m depth, 500km offshore
FPSO (new to NL) = equipment-dense platform
Billion-barrel potential
Still in negotiation —decision soon
REFERRALS:
Dwayne Hopkins (Lab2Market mentor)
Dave Finn (Energy NL CEO) — contact after March 11
Trevor Butler (Lloyd's Register, St. John's) — HIGH PRIORITY
INTERVIEW #32: SHAWN SOOLEY — SHIELD GROUP ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Date: February 12, 2026
Role: CEO, active AM practitioner, class society expert
Rating: 10/10 — EXTRAORDINARY — Game-changing strategies

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. The Invisible Pain: "They Don't Know It's a Problem That Can Be Solved"

Operators have normalized spare parts challenges
AM perceived as "toy solution, not industrial solution"
"Much more obvious in Newfoundland than anywhere else"
2. "3D Printer as Photocopier" Vision

Hardware is NOT the barrier
Knowledge IS the barrier (CAD, materials, geometry, application engineering)
"One Man Parts Catalog" concept — managed service model
Exxon already has Markforged/Onyx printers on rigs but underutilizes them
3. CERTIFICATION REFRAMED: "Your Biggest Adversary Is Extra Work"

"They're never going to do that. I will do that. You will do it."
DNV/Lloyd's work FOR operators, not against them
Real barrier: FEAR OF EXTRA WORK, not actual regulatory impossibility
AddManuChain's killer feature: "We handle the certification so you don't have to"
4. THE "AEROSPACE FIRST" STRATEGY 🚀

GAME-CHANGING: Pursue aerospace certification FIRST
Aerospace = hardest → if you pass, O&G becomes easy
Aerospace = most appetite
Credibility transfer: "You think YOUR rules are more stringent than aerospace? No ."**
PEEK is the golden material — must develop PEEK printing
5. DON'T SELL AI — SELL THE SOLUTION

"I think you're going to have a really hard sell with selling AI"
Predictive maintenance not new (Tan Delta machines, off-the-shelf software)
2 AI perception problems:
Value perception: AI makes work "too easy" → overcharging feeling
Obsolescence fear: Buyers defer waiting for cheaper/better AI next month
Solution: "Don't sell the AI. Sell the solution."
6. Industry Credibility Gap: "Attach Yourself to Someone"

"Get yourself someone from the industry. The only way to gain credibility."
Atlantic XL cautionary tale — couldn't gain traction despite AM capability
Shawn bought $499 Bambu printer → Atlantic XL's target clients came to him instead
Shawn's existing AM business:
Valve stems for industrial
Food processing facility parts
Requests: "Can you make it better than what the other thing was?"
Capacity-constrained — can't serve all demand
"I have a model already established for effectively what you were talking about"
PARTNERSHIP POTENTIAL:
Shawn Sooley =IDEAL industry partner:

✅ Multi-sector exposure
✅ Active AM practice with paying clients
✅ Class society expertise
✅ Aerospace entry (Provincial Aerospace relationship)
✅ Industrial credibility (trades background)
✅ Already doing inventory management
INTERVIEW #33: TYLER BEATTY — EXXONMOBIL CANADA ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Date: February 12, 2026
Role: R&D Advisor, 18-year veteran, managed Hibernia & Hebron
Rating: 10/10 — EXTRAORDINARY — Senior operator insider

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. THE "WAR ON INVENTORY" 💣

Real internal ExxonMobil term
Tension: Cost of inventory vs. cost of hot-shotting
"Charter an aircraft for a doorknob"
Budget politics: Inventory gets CUT because it's tangible/visible
2. EXXONMOBIL'S $17.5M AM COMMITMENT 💰

Tyler personally funded $17.5M for Memorial's SMART Lab (Dr. Ahmed Arubi)
Full supply chain: Materials → Printing → Certification → Testing
Multiple metals printers
Flying researchers to CanMap (Ontario) in March 2026
"I guess that should probably tell you the level of commitment"
3. VALUE–CAPABILITY–PERMISSION VENN DIAGRAM ⭕

VALUE: ✅ PROVEN ("eliminate supply chain = value")
CAPABILITY: ✅ PROVEN ("we can print parts")
PERMISSION: ❌ BLOCKED ("certifying authorities haven't led the charge")
"I actually think that this is a real big stifling of innovation that the certifying authorities haven't led the charge"
AddManuChain must solve the Permission circle
4. FIELDNODE MEMBERSHIP

ExxonMobil is a FieldNode member — actively monitoring AM market
"Regrettable to not be watching"
Monitoring, not yet deploying at scale (Permission blocks them)
5. DIGITAL INVENTORY = "NATURAL TABLE STAKES"

"I personally think it's sort of a natural table stakes in reality"
Tyler sees it as inevitable, not innovative
Digital twin + simulation — parts exist digitally, can be tested before printing
Metadata enrichment opportunity
6. TRL 8→9 & MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)

Can't sell "commercial ready" — must go through pilot
MOC = formal process to change anything on platform
De-risk in analogous environment (onshore) first
POB (Personnel on Board) reduction = #1 technology driver, not cost savings
7. LONG LEAD ITEMS

Well completion design changes
Casing (pressure rating changes)
Surface processing stream equipment
REFERRALS (CRITICAL — Tyler requested follow-up email):
Contact	Organization	Role	Priority
Greda Aleirum	Equinor (Global)	Global Lead, Additive Manufacturing	🔴 HIGHEST
Brad Elliott	Equinor (Canada)	AM representative	🔴 HIGH
Ladna/Lachna	Aker Solutions	AM Lead	🔴 HIGH
Dr. Ahmed Arubi	Memorial SMART Lab	Metals AM researcher	🟡 MEDIUM
Dr. Sima Alecto	Memorial	Material science	🟡 MEDIUM
iNOVi	UNB	AM support for SMEs	🟡 MEDIUM
INTERVIEW #34: AARON PLAMONDON — IRVING SHIPBUILDING ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Date: February 13, 2026
Role: Director of ITB (Industrial Technological Benefits)
Rating: 8/10 — Defense procurement insider

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. ITB Process — "You're Doing It Right Now"

No formal application — pitch to ITB managers at defense primes
"Why would Irving do it? What's in it for Irving?"
Business case matters more than "obligation"
2. Navy AM Failure — "We've Never Been Successful"

Irving + MAMCE invested but NEVER got a single part produced for Navy
Root causes:
Fear of risk ("lives at stake")
No certification standard
No testing infrastructure (~2 companies in Canada)
No admiral's signature
Material uncertainty (5-year lifespan trust)
3. ⏰ FEB 18 OPPORTUNITY — FLEET ADMIRAL VISITING DALHOUSIE

Aaron + Fleet Admiral visiting Dal AM lab Feb 18
Will ask: "Do you see a path? Do you want to do this?"
If yes → Navy officials assigned + Irving funding
ACTION: Follow up with Aaron by Feb 25 for outcome
4. AOPS ≠ Irving, It's Thales

AOPS in-service support = 100% Thales (Lee Vessey confirmed as correct contact)
Halifax Class = Irving Ship Repair (20+ years maintenance data)
5. MAMCE Board — Stalled/Inactive

Aaron hasn't been active in over a year
"All kinds of ideas" but none materialized
Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi focused on powder/material cert
6. L3 Harris — Incumbent on Predictive Maintenance

Leads IPMS (Integrated Platform Management System) for Halifax class
"Way faster" than Irving/DeepSense
Also doing CSC (Canadian Surface Combatant)
7. Data Quality = AI Blocker

"AI only as good as the collection of the data... too unwieldy"
"Some not digital. Pen and paper, spreadsheets."
Position AI as helping digitize first, not plug-and-play
REFERRALS:
Irving Ship Repair team
DeepSense at Dal (data analytics)
Irving Warehousing & Logistics
INTERVIEW #35: NATHAN SMEENK — AGILE MANUFACTURING INC. ⭐⭐⭐
Date: February 13, 2026
Role: VP Operations, Canada's largest 3D printing service bureau
Rating: 7/10 — Honest skeptic, critical competitive intelligence

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. "It's a Gap of Finance, Not Technology"

Canadian companies underfinanced vs US peers
Different barrier for different sectors:
Agile's world (plastic, prototyping): Finance is barrier
AddManuChain's world (marine, defense): Certification is barrier
2. Agile = PLASTIC ONLY — No Metal

"We don't do metal in-house"
SLA, SLS, FDM, MJM (all polymer)
Cannot be production partner for marine/defense metal parts
3. Nathan Doesn't Know Lloyd's or DNV

"I don't know what those are"
Agile operates entirely outside marine/offshore certification ecosystem
No one in Canadian AM service bureau space bridges to marine certification — AddManuChain's opportunity
4. Digital Inventory — "Already Exists, But Poorly"

CRITICAL FEEDBACK: "It already exists. But what it shares is the file... a file doesn't serve you any purpose"
"You need to know how it was set up, what machine, what parameters"
"Thanks for the file, but it's more of a problem than a solution"
DIFFERENTIATION: AddManuChain must include full manufacturing recipe (machine parameters, material specs, process settings, QA data)
5. Existing Competitors Identified:

Spare Parts 3D (SP3D) — Paris, France

DigiPART software analyzes inventory
Partners: Ocyan (Brazil), PDO (Oman)
Up to 11% of parts viable for 3D printing
Uses existing couriers (food/supply deliveries) — not on-site
Fieldnode — Digital inventory consortium

ConocoPhillips, Equinor, Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, BP
Equinor: digitalize half inventory in 10 years
European-focused — not yet in Canada
Nathan's challenge: "These things have been in place, poorly, for a long time. How do you make it better?"

6. COVID Reality Check

"During COVID, what would have served the world was physical inventory"
Digital inventory = complement, not replacement
Don't oversell elimination — pitch "reduce by 20-30%"
7. AI Opportunity — File Prep Automation

Eric: "AI for file prep... automating build prep workflow"
AI-assisted optimization: orientation, supports, nesting, build parameters
STRATEGIC TAKEAWAY:
AddManuChain's differentiation MUST be:

Full manufacturing recipe (not just files)
Canada-first (no competitor established here)
Certified production (bridge to Lloyd's/DNV/MIL-SPEC)
AI-enhanced (build prep, predictive ordering)
Metal-capable partners (MAMCE, defense facilities)
INTERVIEW #39: DAVID HAIRE — CME NL ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Date: February 16, 2026
Role: VP, Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (Newfoundland & Labrador)
Rating: 8/10 — Strong validation, critical business model concerns

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Manufacturers' Top 5 Pain Points (per David):

Labor/skills shortages (#1)
Technology adoption speed (#2)
Product/service launch structure
Export capability
Green/sustainability/net-zero
Supply chain didn't make top 5 — important but not primary

2. Most Manufacturers Use AM Internally, Not Externally

"Bulk of members that use additive are serving themselves"
"Not serving the outside world except 2-3 companies" (Atlantic XL, PolyUnity)
Supply-side AM capacity exists but isn't marketing itself
3. CME Can Be Distribution/Validation Partner

"Absolutely. We've done this with RAPID, Hanover Messe, technology tours"
Regular pilot programs
Can provide member access (1000+ manufacturers)
4. ⚠️ METAL AM ROI IS CHALLENGING

"When it's so expensive to buy the machinery, how do I get my money back?"
"You're almost cheaper just to say, here's somebody make me this part"
CRITICAL CONCERN: Don't build platform around selling metal AM as manufacturing solution
Opportunity: Be the matchmaker, not equipment seller
5. IP/Design Concerns

"Many companies say 'I own the specifications, I don't want anybody to share'"
"When money starts changing hands, it's a different world"
Digital inventory marketplace will face IP resistance
6. THE 15% → 85% GAP OPPORTUNITY

Canada Makes only reaches ~15% of Canadian manufacturers
85% gap = massive opportunity
Not about AM technology — about awareness + connectivity + knowledge
7. AI for Manufacturing Education Gap

CME just launched "AI for Manufacturing" program
Goal: 400 people through training
Many don't understand "Industry 4.0," "smart manufacturing"
Opportunity: Position as "Manufacturing Intelligence Platform"
8. Advanced Manufacturing = Interconnected, Not Siloed

Manufacturers see robotics, Big Data, digital twin, cybersecurity, additive as separate
They're interconnected
AddManuChain's integration of predictive maintenance + digital inventory + AM makes sense
CME COMPANIES TO INTERVIEW:
PolyUnity — Healthcare AM, certification expertise
Atlantic XL — Metal AM facility (already contacted)
Kraken Robotics — Internal AM for subsea systems
FabTech/Silver Dolphin Boats — Marine sector
STRATEGIC PIVOT RECOMMENDATIONS:
Reframe from "AM Marketplace" → "Advanced Manufacturing Ecosystem & Intelligence Platform"
Lead with Digital Inventory + Predictive Maintenance
Include Education/Training Component
Partner heavily with CME NL (access to 1000+ members)
Prioritize Certification Body Integration (Lloyd's, DNV)
CROSS-CUTTING THEMES & STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS
1. QUANTITATIVE DATA UNLOCKED 💰
Metric	Value	Source
Inventory (offshore vessel)	$30-50M	Jason Power
Inventory (utility)	$4-5M	Adam Chubbs

Turbo cost	$200K+	Adam Chubbs
ExxonMobil AM investment	$17.5M	Tyler Beatty
2. CERTIFICATION PATHWAY CLARIFIED ⚖️
Reality Map:

DNV / Lloyd's / ABS = Actual certifying authorities (Tyler, Mike, Shawn confirmed)
C-CORE / Memorial / NRC = Testing facilities (not certifiers)
Utilities self-certify = Lower barrier than expected (Adam Chubbs)
Real barrier = FEAR OF EXTRA WORK, not regulatory impossibility (Shawn)
Solution = "We handle certification so you don't have to" (Shawn)
"AEROSPACE FIRST" STRATEGY (Shawn):

Hardest certification → unlocks all downstream markets
Aerospace appetite highest
PEEK is golden material (must develop)
Credibility transfer eliminates O&G objections

Canada Makes / NCAN	National ecosystem	🟢 PARTNER	Reaches 15% → 85% gap opportunity
Agile Manufacturing	Plastic AM services	🟢 LOW	Plastic only, no marine cert
5. STRATEGIC PIVOTS REQUIRED
FROM → TO
Customer Target:

FROM: End-user operators
TO: Integrators/OEMs (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes) — they decide manufacturing methods
Value Proposition:

FROM: "Cost savings"
TO: "Working capital liberation" + "breakdown insurance"
Messaging:

FROM: Innovation-focused
TO: Reliability + sovereign resilience
AI Positioning:

FROM: "AI-driven platform" (headline)
TO: "We solve spare parts downtime" (AI as feature, not product)
Certification Strategy:

FROM: Assume 2+ year barrier
TO: Target self-certifying customers FIRST (utilities), then aerospace, then O&G
Platform Scope:

FROM: "Digital inventory for AM parts"
TO: "Supply chain intelligence + certification-as-a-service"
6. PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES MATRIX
Partner	Value	Type	Status
Engineered Intelligence	AI asset intelligence platformclosed-loop integration	AI Platform	Ready (Adam Chubbs owns it)
Poly Unity	Atlantic Canada AM ecosystem leader, manufacturing + customer access	Manufacturing	Warm intro Darren)
C-CORE	Marine certification expertise, DNV/ABS/Lloyd's, FAT testing	Certification	Mike Paulin connection

Memorial SMART Lab	$17.5M ExxonMobil-funded metals AM, testing/cert partnership	R&D/Testing	Tyler Beatty intro
NGen / Canada Makes	National AM network, government backing, Select AM tool	Ecosystem	Frank DeFalco follow-up
7. BEACHHEAD MARKET VALIDATED: ARCTIC/REMOTE
Why Arctic is THE beachhead:

Pain Point	Arctic Amplification	AddManuChain Solution
Logistics Cost	Sealift (summer only) vs. air freight (winter 10x)	On-site AM eliminates air freight
Redundancy	N+2 for remote mining (highest cost)	Digital inventory reduces N+2 → N+1
Sovereign Resilience	Federal mandate for northern independence	Position as "sovereign supply chain"
Failure Risk	Peak load failures in winter = worst case	AI predicts, digital inventory ready, AM produces on-site
Validated Evidence:

Adam Chubbs: "Winter failure = air freight big time"
Keith Healey: Arctic niche + sovereign resilience = funding priority
Darren Wood: 10-day Central NL emergency = AM could cut to hours
NEXT ACTIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
