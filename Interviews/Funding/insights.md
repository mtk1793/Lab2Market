# Funding Session Insights
## Startup Funding with Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP
**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Speakers:** André Perey (Partner), Sahil Chopra (Associate)
**Program:** Lab2Market
**Relevance:** AddManuChain — deep-tech, university-origin, Canadian incorporation

## Core Insight #1 — Legal setup is part of your product

Investors evaluate your company as a system, not just your technology. If your equity arrangements are undocumented, your IP ownership is ambiguous, or your governance is informal, the investor sees execution risk — not technical promise.

**What this means for AddManuChain:**
- Any IP that originated from Dalhousie research, lab equipment, or grant-funded work needs a clear chain-of-title assignment to the company before fundraising.
- If any contractor or collaborator has touched core platform code or algorithms, they need a signed IP assignment agreement.
- Founder equity must be formally documented with vesting terms — not based on verbal or message-based agreements.

## Core Insight #2 — Choose your first financing instrument deliberately

The three main options discussed and their practical tradeoff summary:

| Instrument | Speed | Complexity | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SAFE** | Fastest | Lowest | Pre-seed, early angels, before you need governance docs locked |
| **Convertible Note** | Moderate | Medium | When investors expect interest/maturity or SAFE is refused |
| **Priced Preferred Round** | Slowest | Highest | ~$3M+ raise; requires fully locked cap table and governance |

**Key warning:** For early raises, SAFEs are the standard. But each SAFE you issue stacks dilution — if you use post-money SAFEs without careful modeling, you will not know your own ownership percentage until conversion.

**Recommendation for AddManuChain:** Use SAFEs for any early/angel raise before a formal seed round. Document cap and discount terms clearly. Build the cap table model before you sign — not after.

---

## Core Insight #3 — Pre-money vs post-money SAFE: understand this before you sign anything

- **Pre-money SAFE:** Valuation cap is calculated before the new round investment comes in. More founder-favorable.
- **Post-money SAFE:** Valuation cap is calculated after the SAFE investment is included. This is the current Y Combinator standard — and it favors investors.

With post-money SAFEs, issuing multiple SAFEs to different investors stacks dilution in a way that is non-intuitive. Founders who do not model this are regularly surprised when they finally see their ownership after conversion.

**Action:** Before issuing the first SAFE, build or obtain a cap table pro forma tool. Model 3 scenarios: cap only, discount only, cap+discount. Know exactly where your ownership lands in each.

## Core Insight #4 — Governance terms can matter more than valuation

The session explicitly warned:
> A slightly higher valuation is not worth bad governance terms.

Rights granted to early investors are difficult or impossible to unwind. Watch for:
- **Board seats:** Does a small check-writer get veto power or a permanent board seat?
- **Information rights:** What reporting are you legally obligated to provide and to whom?
- **Liquidation preference:** Are investors getting 1x non-participating (fair), or 2x participating (costly to founders in an exit)?
- **Pro-rata rights:** Future investors may be locked out if early investors have uncapped pro-rata.

**For AddManuChain:** As a deep-tech venture with long development cycles (certification, regulatory, defense adjacency), governance terms will significantly affect your flexibility. Do not accept standard VC terms without understanding each provision.

---

## Core Insight #5 — The "investor-clean" standard

Before approaching any serious investor, you must be able to pass a basic diligence checklist. The session identified the following "investor hygiene" items as non-negotiable:

- [ ] Signed founder agreements with vesting and transfer restrictions
- [ ] IP assignment agreements from all technical contributors
- [ ] Shareholder documentation in place
- [ ] Employment vs contractor classification correct and documented
- [ ] University/grant IP obligations identified, disclosed, and resolved
- [ ] Cap table current, accurate, and in a shareable format
- [ ] Securities issuance done under valid exemptions

Failing any one of these creates a diligence flag. Multiple flags can kill a deal even when interest is strong.

## Core Insight #6 — Non-dilutive capital is critical in the current environment

The session emphasized this strongly in the context of Canadian ventures. Non-dilutive capital (grants, IRAP, NRC, SDTC, contracts) is strategically important because:
- It extends runway without diluting the cap table.
- It signals technical credibility to equity investors.
- Canadian CCPC status enables certain tax-advantaged structures — preserving this status requires attention to corporate structure.

**For AddManuChain:** Prioritize non-dilutive grants and defense/government contracts early to reduce the amount you need to raise via equity. This protects dilution and signals validation.

---

## Core Insight #7 — Technical founders must speak the language of investors

Andre flagged this explicitly as a *specific red flag* that investors notice with science/PhD-background founders:

> *"A concern that they just don't really understand their way around concepts around how a company is set up, and importantly how they raise money and what rights investors should reasonably expect."*

Investors need to trust both the technology **and the operator**. Not knowing the difference between a pre- and post-money SAFE, or being vague about cap table mechanics, signals execution risk even when the tech is strong.

**For AddManuChain:** Before any investor conversation, you should be able to explain:
- Why you chose a SAFE over a convertible note
- What your post-money valuation cap implies for founder dilution
- What a liquidation preference is and why it matters at exit
- What CCPC status requires and how you protect it

You don't need to be a lawyer. You need to sound like a founder who takes the business seriously.

## Core Insight #8 — Osler offers deferred-cost startup packages (relevant to your budget)

Osler explicitly onboards 30–40 early-stage companies per month with a startup package model that **defers legal costs** — fees are incurred but not billed until the company hits revenue or a funding milestone.

This means the cost barrier to getting properly set up (IP assignments, founder agreements, shareholder docs) is **much lower than it appears**. The risk of not doing it vastly outweighs the deferred cost.

**Action:** Contact Osler's Toronto emerging companies team (Andre Perey / Sahil Chopra) directly and ask about the startup package. Specifically request:
- Standard SAFE template (Osler's Canadian version)
- Founder equity / vesting agreement
- IP assignment agreement template

---

## Core Insight #9 — Post-money SAFE stacking is the most commonly misunderstood dilution risk

Concrete example from the session:

> Raise $1M on a post-money SAFE with a $5M cap → you have **already sold at minimum 20% of the company** (and potentially more if the next round prices below $5M).

Every additional post-money SAFE at the **same cap** stacks dilution out of the founders — not out of the future investor coming into the priced round. The future investors' percentage is protected; yours compresses.

The session cited **$3 million raised** as the practical threshold where doing a priced preferred-share round starts to make more sense than continuing to issue SAFEs.

**Watch for:**
- Issuing SAFEs to multiple angels at different caps — model the full conversion scenario before each one
- The "good problem" scenario where you raise more than planned via SAFEs: if you cross $3M on SAFEs, a priced round becomes urgent

---

## Notable Statements from the Session

> *"Strong tech doesn't fund itself if the company has governance noise."*

> *"Founders who can speak clearly about cap table mechanics and financing structures signal lower execution risk."*

> *"Don't wait until you're fundraising to clean up. By then, cleanup creates delays that can kill deals."*

> *"Cap + discount in the same SAFE is common — but make sure you understand which conversion mechanism is triggered and when."*

> *"It's essential that you go up the learning curve yourselves — it's all part of the journey as a founder. It can't be overstated how impactful it can be on investors when they understand that a founder really does know their way around these concepts."*

> *"Don't wait until the last minute to kick off the fundraising process — it takes much longer than founders expect."*

## 30-Day Action Items for AddManuChain

1. **Cap table:** Build a pro forma spreadsheet covering pre/post-money SAFE scenarios before any raise conversations.
2. **IP audit:** Map every piece of core IP — who created it, under what conditions, and whether assignment to the company is documented.
3. **Dalhousie IP check:** Confirm whether any university resources, equipment, or grant funding contributed to the platform and what obligations that creates.
4. **Founder docs:** Review or create founder equity agreements with proper vesting and transfer terms.
5. **Contractor agreements:** Identify any past or current technical contractors without signed IP assignment clauses.
6. **Instrument decision:** Decide your bridge-round instrument (SAFE preferred) and your trigger point for a priced round.
7. **Governance red-lines list:** Write down 3–5 governance terms you will not accept before you start investor conversations.
8. **One-page funding brief:** Draft a concise investor brief for AddManuChain covering: problem, solution, traction, ask, use of funds.

## Key Risk (Repeated Warning from Session)

**Do not defer structural cleanup to fundraising time.**
The session made this point multiple times: companies with good products and real traction still fail to close because:
- IP assignment was never formalized
- Founder equity was informally agreed but not documented
- A prior grant or university arrangement creates a claim over core technology
- The cap table is inaccurate or unmodeled

These are fixable problems — but they are much harder to fix under investor scrutiny. Fix them now, while the cost is low.
