## Session Flow (Cleaned from Manuscript)

### 1) Pre-financing setup: get the company "investor-clean"
- Founders were advised not to defer legal setup until later.
- Equity promises must be formally documented (not left in texts/emails/Slack).
- Founder arrangements should include market-standard vesting and governance terms.
- Shareholder rights/obligations should be clearly documented to avoid future disputes.
- Main warning: strong tech can still fail to fund if the company has legal/governance "noise."

### 2) Cap table literacy and governance discipline
- Founders should actively model cap table outcomes before fundraising.
- Misunderstanding dilution mechanics is a common early-stage error.
- Session emphasized preserving Canadian structuring advantages (including CCPC-related pathways where relevant).
- Governance and board rights granted early are hard to reverse later.

### 3) IP chain-of-title and diligence readiness
- Company should own core IP (not founders personally).
- All contributors (employees, contractors, third parties) should assign IP to the company.
- Confidentiality obligations and NDAs should be used before sharing sensitive technical details.
- University/tech-transfer/grant-linked ownership constraints must be identified early.

### 4) Employment and securities-law hygiene
- Correct employee vs contractor classification matters (legal/tax risk).
- Employment agreements should be jurisdiction-appropriate and up to date.
- Issuing shares/securities requires valid exemptions/compliance steps.

### 5) Early-stage financing instruments discussed

#### Common shares
- Recommendation: generally reserve common shares for founder sweat equity.
- Cash investors (including friends/family) should usually be documented through proper financing instruments, not ad hoc common share issuance.

#### SAFEs
- Presented as the dominant early-stage instrument in current market practice.
- Benefits discussed: speed, standardization, lower transaction complexity.
- Key economics: valuation cap and/or discount.
- Important practical point: investors receive whichever conversion is more favorable (cap or discount), not both stacked.

#### Convertible notes
- Similar conversion concept to SAFEs but include debt-like features (interest, maturity).
- Discussed downside: added complexity in accounting/tax and potential founder confusion around rolling accrual.

#### Priced preferred rounds
- More document-heavy and governance-heavy.
- Investors receive preferred rights (e.g., liquidation preference, information rights, board rights).
- Requires a fully locked cap table and finalized company setup before close.

### 6) Pre-money vs post-money SAFE warning
- The session stressed that many founders misunderstand this difference.
- Post-money SAFE stacking can create meaningful dilution surprises if not modeled carefully.
- Founders were encouraged to seek advice and run clear pro forma scenarios before issuing multiple instruments.

### 7) Practical market signal discussed
- Session suggested SAFEs/convertibles are common before larger priced rounds.
- A crossover toward priced rounds was discussed around larger raise sizes (session framing referenced roughly the ~$3M range).

### 8) Common mistakes and misconceptions highlighted
- Underestimating fundraising timeline and cash runway needs.
- Over-focusing only on valuation while ignoring governance terms and investor fit.
- Taking short-term concessions on governance rights that become long-term constraints.
- Choosing advisors without direct startup financing experience.

### 9) Founder signal to investors
- Technical strength alone is not enough.
- Investors assess whether founders can speak clearly about financing structures, governance, and cap table impacts.

### 10) Q&A highlights
- **Cap + discount in SAFEs:** described as common in practice; conversion mechanics should be modeled transparently.
- **Osler startup package model:** explained as high-touch early support with deferred economics for startups.
- **Non-dilutive capital:** emphasized as highly important in current environment, especially for Canadian-based ventures structured to preserve eligibility.
