## 5 Core Questions (for project use)

1. **Fundraising readiness:**  
   *For an early-stage deep-tech startup coming out of Lab2Market, what are the top 3 signs that indicate we are actually ready to raise external funding versus needing more validation first?*

2. **Best first financing instrument:**  
   *For a first institutional or angel raise in Canada, how should founders choose between SAFEs, convertible notes, and priced equity rounds, and what decision criteria matter most at pre-seed?*

3. **Founder mistakes in early rounds:**  
   *What are the most common legal and structuring mistakes you see founders make in their first round that later create friction in due diligence or reduce valuation?*

4. **IP and commercialization risk:**  
   *For university-linked ventures with technical IP, what corporate/IP structure do investors expect to see before investing, and what red flags around IP ownership usually delay or kill deals?*

5. **2026 market reality and strategy:**  
   *Given current market conditions, what fundraising strategy is most effective for Canadian startups in 2026 (round size, investor type, timeline), and what milestones should we hit to improve odds of closing?*

## 2 Bonus Questions

**B1 — Negotiation terms that matter most:**  
*Beyond valuation, which 2–3 term-sheet clauses do first-time founders most often underestimate (e.g., liquidation preference, pro rata, board/control rights), and how should we prepare before negotiating them?*

**B2 — Fit for AddManuChain-type venture:**  
*For a startup building in industrial digital infrastructure (digital inventory + AM + certification), which investor profile is the strongest fit first: angels, strategic corporates, sector-focused VCs, or generalist funds—and why?*

## Suggested Use in Meeting
- Ask Q1–Q3 first if time is tight (they directly affect immediate fundraising decisions).
- Ask Q4 if IP/commercialization is central to your spinout path.
- Ask Q5 to calibrate your next 6–12 months of fundraising execution.
- Use B1/B2 if there is audience Q&A time remaining.

## Insights from Session (Osler)

1. **Set up legal/founder structure early, not later.**
   Deferring founder equity, governance, and IP documentation creates "hair" on the company that can block funding even when the tech is strong.

2. **Document all equity promises immediately.**
   Verbal/text/email promises create future disputes. All founder and team equity should be formalized in signed legal documents with clear vesting and governance terms.

3. **Use market-standard terms and templates.**
   Early deviation from standard startup terms increases diligence friction and negotiation overhead; market convention is usually the safest path.

4. **Cap table literacy is a core founder skill.**
   Founders should model dilution scenarios (SAFE cap, discount, conversion outcomes) before raising so there are no surprises in ownership later.

5. **SAFE is the dominant early-stage instrument in practice.**
   Session guidance indicated SAFE is the most common pre-priced-round path, with priced rounds becoming more common as raises approach larger amounts.

6. **Pre-money vs post-money SAFE mechanics matter a lot.**
   Misunderstanding this can materially change founder dilution; post-money SAFE accumulation can dilute founders faster than expected.

7. **Convertible notes add complexity founders often don’t need.**
   Notes can introduce interest, maturity, and extra tax/reporting complexity compared with SAFEs.

8. **Treat SAFE investors as real investors from day one.**
   Even with lighter governance rights upfront, investor communication and discipline should begin immediately.

9. **IP chain-of-title is a top diligence item.**
   Company ownership of all core IP (from founders, employees, contractors, and third parties) must be clean and assignable; unresolved university/grant claims are major red flags.

10. **Canadian structuring choices affect non-dilutive funding access.**
    Preserving eligibility for programs/tax credits (e.g., CCPC-related benefits) can be strategically important for runway.

## Immediate Actions for Your Funding Project
- Build a 12–18 month pro forma cap table with scenarios: SAFE cap only, discount only, and cap+discount.
- Audit founder/contractor/advisor equity promises and formalize all missing paperwork.
- Run an IP chain-of-title check (including university/grant and contractor assignments).
- Define your preferred first instrument and negotiation boundaries before investor conversations.
- Prepare a one-page "investor readiness" checklist (legal, cap table, governance, IP, financing plan).
