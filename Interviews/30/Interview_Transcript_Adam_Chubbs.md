**Michael:** Hello, how are you?

**Adam:** Nobody bad, thank you very much. Can you hear me?

**Michael:** Yes, yeah, perfect. My mood is it exactly, yeah, yeah, my mood okay yeah, thank you very much. I was going to send you an email, I thought that's technically sure something happened that you couldn't make it.

**Adam:** So no, no, I just did one of these days where I'm, I get it, mom, I've been this feels like I've been 50 meetings today, one of those, one of those days, but thank you for having time.

**Michael:** No, it's all good. Yeah, I appreciate it, that's it. Uh, first of all, let me introduce myself a little bit more. Uh, my name is Michael Kiasari, I'm doing my PhD at Dal Housing University. I'm in the 3rd year of Electrical engineering right now. Recently, I mean, a couple of years ago, I was in a project with a company in Ottawa. They were working on 3D printing and additive manufacturing, so they came up with an idea to work on digital inventory. Then we developed the idea and recently I've got accepted in a program named Lapto Market from Memorial University, Newfoundland. And in this program, they are trying to help new entrepreneurs to check their ideas, to see that their pitch or the thing that they do have in their mind is going to be acceptable for the market or not. It means that throughout this program, I have to talk with at least hundred people, and I have to have the actual meeting with them to validate my work, get their ideas to see that if my some kind of, uh, project is going to work or not, I have to change it or I should do. So that was a little bit about myself. If you don't mind, could you introduce yourself and then we can just cut down for work, that would be fantastic.

**Adam:** Yeah um, so you, you heard about me through Mon, right? To, um yeah um, so I, uh, I tend to go. I've had some evolved last few years down retro factory of engineering, kind of, just sitting in on some of her tech days, and some of her pitch programs and stuff like that and, and things like that. So my background is, um, I've involved with a couple of different business interests. I guess mostly engineering consulting right now. But we also part of a company that we own, um, was called ecotex. We do a lot of circular economy, um, field services, new equipment, reused equipment, refurbished equipment, um, on that side of a deadline of business, I guess in the utilities manufacturing, you name it, whoever these industrial high voltage equipment, medium volley stuff, we do controls. Like I said, Balkan. My work is mostly engineering practice and love. That's utilities mining, privates are producers, stuff like that, right, do a lot of work in a diesel, diesel realm, isolating systems in North, do a lot of transmission distribution type stuff here when utilities regulated, non regulated, so a little bit, pretty much everything, pretty much everything electrical.

I'm also involved. We own a part of a venture called Engineered Intelligence. They are developing AI supportive software for asset intelligence, asset planning and asset condition, condition monitoring stuff like this for free utility. So they've got a software platform called engine. It's called e n e n g e I n. Um, it's kind of a neat setup. So, yeah, I got a few arms in the fire. So that's just pretty much my background. So, um, I don't know if you got any questions or why I do.

**Michael:** So the idea of this kind of meeting is that, yeah, I have to talk with different kind of people from different experience Korean storage and get some ideas. So I would, I, I really actually like that you mention AI because it's also going to be part of my work. So I do have a couple of questions for you for five questions and then I can have a little bit more in detail about my idea. So the reason I'm not talking about it that in detail, it has two reasons actually. The very first reason is, first of all, it is not that very clear and ambiguous. And the second reason is that most of the time I, when I talk with people, they're so nice to me, and every time I mentioned my idea, they said, okay, let's give this guy a little bit of compliment. So I need an honest and true some kind of your perspective throughout the questions that they have.

**Adam:** Yeah, and then we can see, okay, fantastic. Uh, so sorry, I have to free the question for my screen. Uh, take your time take your time, take your time. Don't rush.

## Q1: Spare Parts Criticality & Downtime Costs

**Michael:** So the first question that I do have is about the spare parts criticality and downturn cost. So in your work with remote diesel generators and micro Greece, some kind of in places, like, as you just mentioned, are going to be an offshore newfounds land that happens at, what happens when a critical component fails, and you don't have the spare parts of part on site. Can you watch me through this specific example of emergency repair situation?

**Adam:** Yeah um, so being in remote location, remote prime power diesel, that means perch, perch criticality is is is, is critical for lacking better term, I guess. Um, usually what happens, um you know, for a major failure. Typically we've got redundancy built in, like, it's an N+ 1 or N+ two, uh, generation line up, for example, or, or in a substation, in a situation where we have a transformer, transformer application. It's it's, it's redoneancy, right, Susan N plus one someplace depending on a lot of mining, a lot of mining companies that are, you know, we're downtime production is everything they do an N+ 2.

So for example, some of the remote diamond mines, some of the remote gold mines in the north, they have an N+ 2. So if you look at your generation, they'll have enough sparing, um, available. So there's, there's always one unit available on standby, and there's usually always one out on maintenance, right, plus whatever line required. So, um, that's typically, um, and it even goes for some of the utility here in the in the, in the transmission. And the transmission world is, is pretty much. They've got contingencies, right, they've got, they've got, you know, two transmission lines where they can, you know, get away with one to carry the peak and stuff like this for, for a car transfer. And for some of the critical, some of the critical transmission systems that we have here. Right, same thing in substations, the usual breaker and a half breaker in the third configuration soldiers just redone, see.

Um, so and then regards the sparing, like, there is besides, besides redone, see, you know, the, the warm standbys and the and the and the, and the predomency that are in the system. There are still, uh, critical items, like, uh you know uh, typically we standardize the breakers. We standardize, um you know, just the size of specification of breaker, you know, utility world, a lot of things are standardized. So within, within the whole asset fleet, there's usually one 1 critical spare, um, that'll that, you know, that we could, then we can deploy anywhere within the system. Um, if there's a, if there's a major failure, uh, there is, there is a critical spare.

And then, um, on a distribution world, it's kind of a, it's kind of a failure maintenance realm, right, you know, we don't, we don't do inspections on transformers and stuff in the distribution feel till they fail or till there's an issue. Um, but regards of critical spares for transformers with always 5% of whatever we have in service that, that's in stock, right, yeah um, of each size of transformer. And then there's, there's also storm, storm spares that they have in inventory for, for weather related issues. And then they also have vendor alliances with different Oems. Right. So beside and even on the generation side, I know with Caterpillar or with Detroit Diesel watchers. There's also besides the critical sparing, there's also vendor alliances where they stock stuff, I guess more so on consignment. So if, if they need it, they can get it out to door. They agree to have us, have to have it in stock for us, right, utility. I should say sometimes I speak like, I'm utility, I worked in salons, but, yeah, that's, that's, kind of, had a few different, you know, things that you do. There's two built in system redone seat, and there's critical spares that they do stock for across the whole system. And then they have, they have OEM vendor license rights that different suppliers, different manufacturers.

**Michael:** Thank you very much.

## Q2: Inventory Strategy & Capital Tied Up

**Michael:** Uh, so for the second question for reboot power generation sites better in some, kind of, in your location or offshore platforms or isolated microgrades, what's your typical inventory strategy? I mean, you talked a little bit about that do stockpile the, all the critical parts on site, and if so, how much capital is tied to in that specific in the inventory. So I'm trying to have rough numbers, not exact numbers, because I want to see that my idea is going to reduce that cost or not.

**Adam:** Yeah um, so a cost of that's interesting, um, depends on the utility, I guess. Um, are you looking for a dollar amount? Such how many dollar amounts you have would be fine? I mean, again, rough numbers, I'm not looking for exact one, just something would be fine with me. You know, I take example, I guess something of an order and utility. Um I mean, there's several million dollars in inventory at any given time, like this utility, I don't know. It's, I'm just trying to think assets to inventory here to give you an idea. Um I mean, if they got $50 million of assets, they probably got four to five million dollars of inventory.

Yeah, but again, you know one transformer would be 100 grand, and then you got 10 cent bolts next to it too, right. So it's, which takes up a lot more space than you know what I mean. I guess you could say, you know 10% of the inventory takes up, you know 90% of the cost, right, um, cause there's a lot of big ticket items. Yeah, um but that being said, some of the small nuts and bolts can, can kind of whatever can can slow down the whole engine overall. For example, was worth a million bucks. So, um, you know so it, it varies. You know there's a I'm just looking here. There's a, a lot of utilities too. They do a, um, in the north, are looking also in an asset health index.

So they, kind of look at a Jen set, look at a generator installation, and break down all the systems, and look at what's, what's what's critical and what's, you know what condition of it is, and what they should have in stock based on the health of all the different. Yes, no of the health of the incomes of the asset. So, um, just looking here, I'm trying to find that.

**Michael:** That's okay if you can do that. That's, that's not myself without trying there. So that's, that's totally fine, but, yeah, I got the rough idea. Yeah, I was just looking for that. Yeah, thank you.

## Q3: Arctic Logistics & Lead Times

**Michael:** So for the next question, when you need to get a spare part to a remote sites, site, say a diesel generated component, for example, in offshore platforms, in the bay or this kind of regions. What's the typical elite time, and how does that change in winter when ice road closed? Better problems that we do have right now is going to affect on that.

**Adam:** Yeah, the logistics of it affected big time, I guess depending on the size of the park. But if there's a major failure in winter time, which is peak load, um, most communities in the north, the only option you have is the flight in which, which, uh, you know increase your costs for freight big time. Versus, you know most of the capital work is planned for summer months for sea lifts. Uh, take it from Montreal to the Arctic, for example, on boat which, which significantly lowers the cost rate. So depending on the size of the failure and when it occurs, yeah, it could cost you quite a bit. And then just shipping alone, you know downtime and then issues regards to that. So, yeah, perfect.

---

## Q4: Certification, Regulations & Additive Manufacturing

**Michael:** Uh, so the next question that they have is about certification and regulations. I mean her hair that a lot, uh, for their long story certification and regulations, okay, I forgot a lot. So before asking that question, I would like to know a fact that in the line of having the spare parts and in the line of using the parts that you don't have rather than the ones in your stock, that is okay. But have you considered working with 3D printing and additive manufacturing? Obviously not. You cannot say that in the big transformer. Obviously, I'm talking about the parts that at least you can use because when we are talking about the failure, we are not talking about the whole generation part. Obviously, maybe there are some smaller parts that can be produced by additive manufacture. Have you considered using that or maybe you're still using it?

**Adam:** Yeah, I mean I can see a utility from utility perspective or modding discounting not using it because I'm talking about certifications and CSA certifications and regulations. I mean one thing about a utility, um, for example, you're kind of self regulating, so I mean we would we don't have to buy CSA certified electro equipment, for example. We kind of certified our own, like a lot of stuff we buy. My experience in the past, you know it's we write a specification, you know and it would follow us pretty much, follows a lot of CSA requirements, but we don't look for that sticker on the equipment of such. We don't need to because, um, you know we're in a substation or powerhouse, uh, we're in an environment that's not exposed to the public and risk is not there. So, um, you know everybody handling this equipment are qualified certified individuals, so we don't, typically utilities don't pursue that, that CSA sticker all the time. For example are the UL, you know some components are obviously, um, but usually, you know the utility certifies, you know follows particular standard that they want. And usually it's their own inhum, standard, right?

So, so your own, what do you call a regenerative manufacturing is it? Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry about the, what part did you mention about 3D printing. What did you call that? Additive manufacturing. Sorry, additive, additive, I was thinking about another part or 3D printing. I mean additive manufacturing, 3D printing is kind of the same concept. Yeah, yeah I just I guess it's just a general term. I guess what it is and the bend, okay, yeah I mean it's just try to think we, I mean I look back even before the 3D printing days. We had our own in certain utilities, the main one that I worked. We had our own machine shop, so we actually milled a lot of parts, right? We, we milled a lot of when we had two engine parts, like casino heads and stuff like this, uh, you know during overhauls and during certain situations to fix an issue. Right, so, um, fabrication on site of your own stuff is not it's not uncommon, especially even offshore. But I've seen some of that now might not be done on the rig, but it might be done here in the local machine shop. You know when it comes to hydraulic fittings, and, and and the low price are done here, machined here and then, then flowing offshore of it. So, yeah, make sense.

**Michael:** Okay, yeah I forget I got it thank you.

## Q5: AI, Digital Inventory & Predictive Maintenance

**Michael:** And one last question that they have because you also mentioned about that is about the AI. Because I mean during my PSG research, I'm a master, I was working with AI for around for 5 years. So I thought, why not try to use it in this project that I'm working on which is mostly related to additive manufacture? I talked to a couple of industries and they told me that it would be better to use AI in different kind of aspect to see that which pitch is going to be yours. So the very first one that they had in my mind was about using it digital inventory. By digital inventory, I mean using the additive manufacturing and 3D printing. Cause the whole idea of this work is that try to encourage different industries, most of it would be about the offshore one they do have, they are isolated or they don't have that much of access to the unsure and other kind of facilities. Try to encourage them to have their own 3D printing machine and try to focus on digital inventory rather than physical inventory because on that point they can produce the part that they need. Maybe it will be the temporary solution, they will be a permanent solution, but that's going to help them.

And another aspect was about the using AI because not only we can use the AI in digital inventory itself, but we can use it in physical inventory because we can just kind of give the data to it based on the everything that we do have. Because I've, I know that people they do, I mean the one important issue about these days is that we do have lots of data, but we don't have human capital to some kind of translate to data. So by using AI, we can have that some kind of capability for ourselves. Another thing that I've heard is going to be usable is about the predictive maintenance. So I talked with a couple of industries and they told me about that how do you see the workage of the some kind of the potential of using AI and technology not in additive manufacturing just by itself in general yeah, by in general yeah, how do you see that look like?

**Adam:** I mentioned where we're. I'm doing some work from the asset intelligence site where we do uh, we, we collect, I mean a lot of utilities have trolls of, of, uh, maintenance data and, and, um, asset, uh, condition data. And the all kind of work under silos and, kind of, to decipher, you know asset condition, and then do predict failure and look at, you know system planning regardless of low growth and all that good stuff generation planning. So, um, to push now is in a lot of areas. Like I said, you're using some software that could take on this machine learning data and dump it into some things. Like I said, we've got in my experience in some utilities. We got the transformer guys doing a spreadsheet here, and someone else got literally written data, already have Sketa data from a database that sit somewhere. And it just it's just crap accumulating, and no one really can pieces together and look at the big picture.

So the push now is, is to bring all that into common, common area that you can use it to, to predict failures, to predict overloads to, you know predict where you're gonna have issues with, with capacity in the future. All that stuff, you know any tie that to, you know historical weather patterns and all that stuff, and, and give you an idea of what your what your asset picture is. So that's just a lot of that going on now. It's taking off a bit utilities. We see it, um, at West Lot in the US now. Um, and as well on the offshore side, there's a lot of push now on preventive maintenance side for digital twins, yep, start to do a lot of that now, where they actually need to build a digital model. And they, they they run up to predict potential failures or issues down rule, right. So that's a couple of companies here locally, uh, Enamcos will company doing it now for offshore, for, uh, for sub C they're doing the whole digital twin type thing now for pretty offshore, so they could not a lot of this stuff.

So, yeah, so it's definitely AI is this creeping into that world just like everywhere else, I guess. But it's even before, I guess AI became a sexy term, they were they were using just they were using you know they were developing platforms that could pull in all this information and, and do predictions and do modeling and do forecasting. Right? Yeah, yeah I guess what AI now kind of is making, I assume it's probably making life easier for some of these companies to, to do these calculations without having the lay a map and all of themselves. So you have excess.

**Michael:** I mean the pretty, the last question of mostly was for myself because in the PSG research that I'm doing right now, it, because obviously it's an electrical site. I'm trying to focus on how I can use the AI to make it life a little bit easier by prediction, by connecting different kind of devices like the facts or electrical vehicle and also using the scatter and any information that you just mentioned. We do have all of them, but we don't know what to do with them. I'm trying to use that in my own work mainly. But, yeah, this project that I'm doing with this company, we also consider about using AI in additive manufacturing and digital inventor section.

---

## Pitch Discussion: Digital Inventory Ecosystem

**Michael:** Okay, uh I'm done with my question. So let me just talk a little bit about the idea that I do have. So the idea that we are developing right now is that we are the main focus is on additive manufacturing and using 3D printing. The idea is that try to build an ecosystem between different kind of entities like the end user, anyone on offshore, on your industry or any other kind of industries, Oems, the people they do have the blueprint of that specific components that we are going to produce 3D printing facilities and the important part about the regulations and all of those people behind back to give you certifications. So the idea was about building this ecosystem that leads us to the fact of digital inventory.

I mean I talked with a couple of industries, and they told me that they are paying a huge amount of money for the stock, as you just mentioned about the millions where they have to keep the parts on site just in case if something happens to it. Maybe sometimes it doesn't, and maybe it would be, for example, 10, 15 years, and after that, if something happens, if they want to use it, it just out of date or maybe they have some issues.

**Adam:** So by having a lot, yeah, that used to happen a lot, or just, just filling in on a preservation becomes an issue, right? Like, you, we buy a 200,000, dollar turbo for an engine, and, you know you have to you you have to properly preserve it, which is a cost, which can be a big cost too, right. And some fluids and stuff that, that are used for example, that are in storage, um, you know just in time inventory is nice, but then you gotta balance that with reliability, you gotta have it, right. Yeah. So yeah, it's, it's a it's definitely a big cost, um, in the north because, you know it comes down to keep the lights on and then liability and keep production. So you kind of it's a necessary evil. I guess we've got to spend the preservation money and you spend the storage money to do that. But yeah, it is a it is a you know there's a better way to do it. I guess like I said, you haven't got to have to sit on a shelf or have to preserve it due to preservation meetings on it. Definitely, yeah, exactly.

**Michael:** That completely makes sense up there. Some kind of back to your word about this kind of huge cost and other parties about the human capital, obviously they have to have someone to some kind of work around. We don't have robots. We have to have people. So all of these costs are there. And when I was talking with industries, they see these costs but they don't have any solution for that and they think that that's the way it is. I mean this is this was for example, 20, 30, 50 years ago and it still is. So when you're talking about the new idea with them, they say that we don't know, that we are not, I mean most of the time they are not educated enough to, for instance, what is the additive manufacturing, what are the capability? And they're completely right because we all also don't have that kind of platform or maybe at this point we can call it as MVP yet to some kind of offered offering to you so that this is the platform and also we need to have certifications and registration.

For example, when we are talking about the oil and gas industry, we are talking about Lloyd or a DMV or any other kind of names we have to pack. We have to have those guys behind their back to come to you guys and say that this is the pitch. Do you wanna buy it or not? And also at the end was about using AI, as I just mentioned, I'm trying to some kind of gather around all of these information from different industry sites to see that which one works, which one is there. Like, you just mentioned that you admit that there is a gap there, so can I feel this gap with my product or not? Yep. So what do you what do you think at the end of the day about this some kind of idea that I'm working on? Do you think it's worth it? Or

**Adam:** Yeah, I think you definitely got something there, you just gotta map it out. I guess, you know the concept of digital inventory and stuff makes sense. Um, cause like I said, it's definitely, um, definitely an issue in an isolated areas. If you could, we talked about having inventory and preservation and having the, the man power to, you know count the nuts and bolts every day and, and restock and logistics of that definitely. I think there's definitely an application there to. You can link that to, to what somebody's AI platforms that are looking at preventative and predicted maintenance and assets health and integrity and stuff like that. I mean some of these software programs could probably spit into critical inventory that is, you know where I've known we're seeing failures to conform us. We're receiving failures and then, you know where what, what you need to print and what you don't write when you need to print it. So exactly, yeah, that makes sense.

**Michael:** Yeah, perfect, perfect. Thank you very much. You just passed the timing that we have. I'm so sorry. I appreciate for your timing and that was fantastic formation. Just I had one quick favor to ask is that most of the time at the end of each conversation, I would say this to people, so, yeah, right now I'm just doing the research. I'm just working on everything. I do have all of the options on my table as Trump says all the time. So I'm trying to gather information as holding all the cards. Yeah, yeah I'm trying to gather all of the information as much as possible. But maybe in couple of months later I just again reach out to you, say that I do have this information. I think maybe you can help me with that, with another kind of 50 minutes 20 minutes meeting. Would that be possible for you?

**Adam:** Sure. Yeah, yeah I know we have a busy schedule, but I really appreciate it. If you can find some time for me, that would be perfect.

**Michael:** Yep, yep, that's everything. Perfect, perfect perfect. Again, thank you very much for the time, and hope you have a great day.

**Adam:** No problem. Thanks. Good luck to you. Take care. Thanks.
