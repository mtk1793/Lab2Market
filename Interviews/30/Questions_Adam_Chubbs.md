## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: Spare Parts Criticality & Downtime Costs 🚨
**"In your work with remote diesel generation and microgrids—especially in places like Nunavut or offshore Newfoundland—what happens when a critical component fails and you don't have the spare part on-site? Can you walk me through a specific example of an emergency repair situation and what it cost in terms of downtime, logistics, and lost revenue?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates emergency procurement hypothesis**: Andrew said downtime is extremely expensive
- **Quantifies willingness to pay**: If downtime costs $50K/day, customers will pay a premium for fast parts
- **Tests Arctic niche**: Keith said warehouse heating costs are astronomical—are spare parts stockpiled?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Specific downtime costs**: "A 3-day outage in Nunavut cost $200K in emergency diesel shipments"
- ✅ **Logistics nightmares**: "We had to charter a helicopter in a blizzard to get a $500 part"
- ✅ **Life-safety implications**: "Power outages in -40°C weather are life-threatening"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We always have backup parts on-site" (no urgency = no market)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's the longest you've waited for a critical part to arrive in a remote location?"
- "Do you stockpile spare parts on-site? If so, how much capital is tied up in inventory?"
- "Have you ever had to cannibalize parts from one system to keep another running?"
- "What's the most expensive emergency part delivery you've coordinated?"

### Q2: Inventory Strategy & Working Capital in Remote Sites 💰
**"For remote power generation sites—whether in Nunavut, offshore platforms, or isolated microgrids—what's your typical inventory strategy? Do you stockpile critical spares on-site, and if so, how much capital is tied up in that inventory? How do you balance the cost of carrying inventory versus the risk of not having a part when you need it?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates working capital hypothesis**: Kwadwo said this is the #1 ROI driver for CFOs
- **Tests <50-unit threshold**: Andrew said AM only works for low-volume parts
- **Explores digital inventory opportunity**: Could AM replace physical stockpiling?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Massive inventory costs**: "We have $5M in spare parts sitting in warehouses across Nunavut"
- ✅ **Obsolescence risk**: "Parts sit for 10 years and then become obsolete"
- ✅ **Insurance stock**: "We keep 'just-in-case' inventory that rarely gets used"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We use just-in-time delivery for everything" (no inventory problem = no opportunity)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What percentage of your spare parts inventory is used within the first year? Within 5 years?"
- "Do you have parts that have been sitting in inventory for 10+ years?"
- "What's your annual inventory carrying cost (storage, insurance, depreciation)?"
- "Have you ever written off obsolete inventory? How much?"
- "Do you use consignment models with OEMs to reduce capital exposure?"

### Q3: Logistics Challenges & Lead Times in Arctic/Remote Operations ❄️
**"When you need to get a spare part to a remote site—say, a diesel generator component in Nunavut or an offshore platform in the Bay du Nord region—what's the typical lead time? And how does that change in winter when ice roads close or weather grounds helicopters?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates Arctic niche**: Keith said logistics are a nightmare in remote areas
- **Tests helicopter shipping insight**: Andrew said informal coordination exists
- **Quantifies lead time pain**: If it takes 6 weeks in winter, AM could be a game-changer

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Extreme lead times**: "In winter, it can take 8-12 weeks to get parts to Nunavut"
- ✅ **Weather dependency**: "Helicopter deliveries are grounded 40% of the time in winter"
- ✅ **Multi-modal logistics**: "We use ice roads, sealift, and helicopters depending on the season"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We can get parts anywhere in 48 hours" (no logistics problem = no opportunity)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's the most remote site you've had to deliver parts to?"
- "Do you coordinate with other operators to share helicopter shipments?"
- "Have you ever used ice roads or sealift for spare parts delivery?"
- "What percentage of your logistics budget goes to emergency/expedited shipping?"
- "If you could manufacture parts locally in Nunavut or St. John's, how much would that save?"

### Q4: Certification & Regulatory Pathways for AM Parts 📜
**"As a licensed professional engineer (P.L. Eng.) with PEGNL, what would it take for you to approve an additively manufactured part for use in a critical power system—say, a diesel generator component or a microgrid switchgear part? What certifications, testing, and documentation would you require?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates certification barrier**: Keith said this is a major hurdle
- **Identifies regulatory pathway**: What standards apply (CSA, UL, DNV)?
- **Tests liability concerns**: Will engineers accept AM parts for critical infrastructure?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Specific standards**: "It would need CSA certification and material traceability"
- ✅ **Testing requirements**: "We'd need fatigue testing, environmental testing, and failure analysis"
- ✅ **Pathway exists**: "If it meets the same standards as OEM parts, I'd approve it"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "I would never approve an AM part for critical infrastructure" (deal-breaker)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Have you worked with C-CORE or other testing labs for component validation?"
- "Would you accept AM parts for non-critical components (e.g., housings, brackets)?"
- "What's the typical timeline and cost for certifying a new component?"
- "Do you have relationships with PEGNL or C-NLOPB that could help navigate certification?"
- "If an AM part was certified by DNV or Lloyd's Register, would that be sufficient?"

### Q5: Sovereign Capability & Military/Government Procurement 🎖️
**"Given your 25+ years in the Canadian Armed Forces and your work with the Government of Nunavut, do you see a strategic case for Canada to develop sovereign additive manufacturing capability—especially for remote communities, military bases, or critical infrastructure? Is there government or military interest in reducing dependence on foreign supply chains?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Tests sovereign resilience hypothesis**: Is there government funding or procurement interest?
- **Explores military market**: Canadian Armed Forces could be a major customer
- **Validates strategic value**: Beyond economics, is there a national security case?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Strategic interest**: "Absolutely—Canada needs domestic manufacturing for Arctic sovereignty"
- ✅ **Government funding**: "There are ISED and Defense R&D programs for this"
- ✅ **Military procurement**: "The Navy and Air Force struggle with obsolete parts"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "The government isn't interested in this" (no public sector opportunity)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Are there specific military or government programs focused on Arctic resilience?"
- "Would the Canadian Armed Forces be interested in AM for spare parts?"
- "Do you have contacts at ISED, Infrastructure Canada, or Defense R&D?"
- "Could AM reduce Canada's dependence on U.S. or European supply chains?"
- "Is there a business case for AM in remote Indigenous communities?"
