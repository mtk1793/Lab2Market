# Interview Questions - Andreas Leitner (OMV)

**Name:** Andreas Leitner  
**Title:** Senior Vice President, Innovation & Technology  
**Company:** OMV (Austrian Oil & Gas Major)  
**Meeting Date:** February 4, 2026, 11:30am  
**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Oil & Gas Innovation Leader, European Perspective)

**Context:** OMV is one of Europe's largest integrated oil & gas companies. Andreas leads innovation & technology, meaning he evaluates emerging tech like AM for enterprise deployment. European perspective complements North American interviews (Equinor, ExxonMobil, Canadian operators).

## QUESTION 1: OMV's Digital Transformation & Inventory Strategy

**Background:** Dr. Nasiri (Interview 11) revealed Equinor and ExxonMobil are implementing digital inventory with Siemens. OMV is peer company—are they pursuing same path?

**Question:**

> "Dr. Ali Nasiri at Dalhousie mentioned that Equinor and ExxonMobil are implementing digital inventory systems for oil & gas operations—shifting from massive physical spare parts warehouses to CAD libraries with additive manufacturing on-demand, using Siemens as their technology contractor.
>
> Is OMV pursuing a similar digital inventory strategy? And if so:
> - What stage are you at? (exploration, pilot, full deployment)
> - What's working well, and what challenges are you encountering?
> - Are you building in-house capability or partnering with technology vendors like Siemens?
>
> If OMV hasn't prioritized digital inventory yet, what's holding it back—business case, certification, technology maturity, or other factors?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Peer validation:** If OMV confirms, strengthens Equinor/Exxon pattern (market proof)
- **European perspective:** Different regulatory environment (ATEX vs North American standards)
- **Implementation insight:** What's working/failing at enterprise scale?

**What You're Testing:**
- **Market validation:** Is digital inventory a global oil & gas trend, or just North America?
- **Partnership model:** Build vs buy (Siemens enterprise vs platform startup)
- **Platform opportunity:** If OMV is "exploring," could they be early customer?

## QUESTION 2: European AM Certification (ATEX vs North American Standards)

**Background:** All North American interviews emphasize certification as THE barrier. Europe has ATEX (explosive atmospheres) standards. Is certification easier or harder in Europe?

**Question:**

> "I keep hearing from North American operators that certification is the #1 barrier to AM adoption in oil & gas—the regulatory bodies (DNV, Lloyd's Register, ASTM) haven't standardized certification pathways, so it's expensive and time-consuming to certify each part individually.
>
> From OMV's European perspective:
> - Is ATEX certification for AM parts more streamlined than North American standards, or just as challenging?
> - Has the EU made any progress on standardizing AM certification for oil & gas applications?
> - Does OMV see a pathway to pre-certified parts libraries that could be reused across multiple assets without re-certifying each time?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Regional comparison:** Europe vs North America (find easier certification pathway)
- **Regulatory insight:** EU may be ahead on AM standards (learn from them)
- **Platform feature:** Pre-certified library = solution if EU has templates

**What You're Testing:**
- **Certification arbitrage:** Is Europe easier? (if yes, start there)
- **Pre-certification pathway:** Does EU allow template reuse? (validates platform concept)
- **Competitive advantage:** Could platform leverage EU standards for global deployment?

## QUESTION 3: AI for Innovation & Technology (SVP Perspective)

**Background:** As SVP of Innovation & Technology, Andreas evaluates AI tools. Your platform uses AI for inventory optimization—does this resonate?

**Question:**

> "As SVP of Innovation & Technology at OMV, you're likely evaluating hundreds of AI-driven tools claiming to optimize operations. I'm developing a platform that uses AI specifically for digital inventory—things like:
>
> - **Predictive inventory depletion:** AI alerts operators when critical parts will run out based on usage patterns
> - **Certification pathway optimization:** AI recommends fastest/cheapest route to certify AM parts
> - **Part suitability scoring:** AI analyzes inventory to identify which parts are best candidates for AM conversion
>
> From your experience evaluating AI solutions for oil & gas, what separates AI tools that actually get adopted from those that get piloted and abandoned? And do these specific AI capabilities address real OMV pain points, or am I solving the wrong problem?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Platform validation:** Does SVP Innovation see value in AI features?
- **Adoption insight:** Why do AI tools fail? (avoid those mistakes)
- **Pain point verification:** Are you solving real problem or assumed problem?

**What You're Testing:**
- **Feature prioritization:** Which AI capability resonates most? (depletion? certification? suitability?)
- **Adoption factors:** Integration with SAP/ERP? ROI proof? Change management?
- **Enterprise sales:** What does SVP need to champion platform internally?

## QUESTION 4: OMV Innovation Portfolio & Partnership Model

**Background:** Large oil & gas companies often pilot innovations through accelerators, venture partnerships, or joint development. How does OMV approach emerging tech?

**Question:**

> "OMV likely sees dozens of startups pitching digital solutions for oil & gas operations. As you evaluate innovation partnerships:
>
> - Do you prefer **enterprise vendor relationships** (like Siemens—proven, expensive, slow)?
> - Or **startup pilots** (faster, cheaper, riskier)?
> - Or **joint development** (co-create solutions with academic/startup partners)?
>
> And for a digital inventory + AM platform specifically:
> - Would OMV be open to piloting with a startup platform, or does this need proven enterprise validation first?
> - What would a successful pilot look like? (asset type, timeline, success metrics)
> - Who at OMV makes the decision to pilot new technology—yourself, asset managers, procurement?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Sales pathway:** How to approach OMV (direct to Andreas? asset managers? procurement?)
- **Pilot structure:** What does OMV need to trial platform?
- **Partnership model:** Co-development = funding + validation + customer #1

**What You're Testing:**
- **Go-to-market strategy:** Startup pilot vs enterprise validation requirement
- **Decision-making:** Who's the buyer? (IT? ops? innovation?)
- **Pilot opportunity:** Could OMV be first European customer?

## FOLLOW-UP OPPORTUNITIES:

**If Andreas mentions OMV is exploring digital inventory:**
> "What's the biggest gap you're trying to solve—cataloging parts, certification pathways, ROI measurement, or something else? I'm trying to prioritize which platform features matter most."

**If Andreas mentions certification is easier in Europe:**
> "Could a platform leverage EU certification standards as a competitive advantage globally—essentially offering 'EU-certified' digital parts library that North American operators could adopt?"

**If Andreas is enthusiastic about AI features:**
> "Would OMV be open to a pilot? We could integrate with one OMV asset, track inventory for 3-6 months, and demonstrate ROI with real OMV data."

**If Andreas mentions OMV prefers proven enterprise vendors:**
> "That makes sense for core infrastructure. If the platform were validated by a few mid-size operators first, then approached OMV later, would that change the risk profile enough to pilot?"

**If Andreas mentions specific pain points:**
> "Who at OMV experiences this pain point day-to-day—asset integrity team? procurement? operations managers? I'd love to talk to them to understand the operational reality."

**At the end:**
> "OMV is a leader in European oil & gas innovation. As I develop this platform, would you be open to staying connected? Even if OMV isn't ready to pilot immediately, your insights on what works/doesn't in enterprise oil & gas are invaluable."
