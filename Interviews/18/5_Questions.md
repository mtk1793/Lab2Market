# Interview 18 - Andreas Leitner (OMV)
## 5 QUESTIONS ONLY

**1. EUROPEAN ENTERPRISE SPARE PARTS CHALLENGES:**
"What are the biggest spare parts and inventory challenges at OMV? How do European operational constraints differ from North American oil & gas—is it regulatory complexity (ATEX), procurement processes, or something else?"

**2. ENTERPRISE AI ADOPTION:**
"From your experience at a large enterprise like OMV, what determines whether AI tools get adopted or ignored? Is it about proving ROI, integration with existing systems, or building trust with operations teams? What separates successful AI pilots from failed ones?"

**3. ATEX CERTIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE:**
"How does ATEX certification work for AM parts in European offshore operations? Who manages that process—OMV, suppliers, or certification bodies? Would digital compliance tools that automate documentation make adoption faster?"

**4. ENTERPRISE PARTNERSHIP MODELS:**
"For new technologies, does OMV prefer to work with startups through pilot projects, established vendors (like Siemens or GE), or build solutions in-house? What makes a partnership compelling from an enterprise perspective?"

**5. DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM VISION FOR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS:**
"Imagine a platform that connects operators, AM suppliers, OEMs, and certification bodies across Europe—like a digital marketplace for ATEX-compliant parts. What would make that valuable to OMV? What barriers or concerns would need to be addressed for enterprise adoption?"
