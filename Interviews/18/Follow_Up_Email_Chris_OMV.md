Hi Chris,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss OMV's innovation priorities and the future of spare parts management in oil & gas operations. Your vision that **"inventory management should be fully AI-based"** and your clarity on what it takes to make a business case were exactly the guidance I needed.

## Key Takeaways

**1. The 15% Business Boost Benchmark**

Your requirement was crystal clear:

> "If you tell them you boost your business by 15%... and you get all of the sudden new customers which you will have never dreamed of... to show the business potential—because at the end, you don't apply anything unless it's to make more money."

This is now my target:
- **Not** vague "cost savings" or "efficiency gains"
- **Exactly:** 15% quantified business boost
- **Plus:** Growth opportunity (new customers), not just cost reduction

**2. "Inventory Management Should Be Fully AI-Based"**

Your certainty on this point validates the platform's AI-first approach:

> "I am pretty sure that the whole inventory management can, it should be fully based on AI... if you are not following this path, you will not be competitive anymore."

The platform is now positioned as an **AI optimization engine** that makes the critical decisions:
- **Which parts to stock physically?** (high-volume, common failures)
- **Which parts to maintain digitally?** (low-volume, specialized)
- **How to source?** (OEM vs. aftermarket vs. AM provider)

This hybrid model aligns perfectly with your vision of using AI to **"understand which parts do I have to have on stock, which not, how do I source it."**

**3. The 6-Month Valve Wait Crisis**

Your example was powerful:

> "Whenever the valve breaks and I need to wait half a year to get a new one, because it's a special whatever valve... this is a no-go."

Even as an "extreme case," this scenario represents:
- Millions in lost production (offshore platform downtime)
- Working capital tied up in over-stocking to avoid this scenario
- **Opportunity:** AM as emergency backup for specialized parts

**4. Safety as Non-Negotiable**

I completely understand your emphasis:

> "Safety, safety, safety. Which is number one. We can only operate safely. We don't do it at all."

Oil & gas operates in high-pressure, high-risk environments where one failed part can be catastrophic. Your point that **"this will be solved by deploying the technology—when you have security data, safety standards are met, I see no issue"** clarifies the path:

1. **Prove with other industries** (Navy, aerospace with existing certification pathways)
2. **Collect safety/performance data** from those deployments  
3. **Return to OMV** with validated solutions and DNV/Lloyd's certifications

OMV is appropriately a **fast follower**, not early adopter—and that timeline (3-5 years) makes complete sense.

## Addressing IP Protection

Your immediate concern was spot-on:

> "If you want to bring all your partners together, how this would actually work? Because the IP... people will hide behind IP here."

I'm solving this architecturally (not just contractually):

- ✅ **On-premise CAD processing** (files never leave customer systems)
- ✅ **Zero-knowledge architecture** (platform brokers connections but never sees files)
- ✅ **Blockchain audit trail** (licensing/tracking without file access)

Modeled after Canada Makes' "Select AM" tool that was **"adopted by big heavy hitters"** because it's **technically impossible** for the platform to steal IP.

## Applying Your Feedback

**Business Case Development:**
- Leading with outcomes: **"Boost your business by 15% + unlock new customers"**
- Quantifying value: Downtime reduction, working capital freed, revenue protection
- Proving ROI with pilot data (not promises)

**OMV Timeline:**
- **Not pursuing immediate sale** (premature without proof)
- **Building proof** with Navy/aerospace (2026-2027)
- **Re-engaging OMV** (2028-2029) with validated case studies and safety certifications

**Platform Positioning:**
- Not "replace all inventory with AM"
- **Hybrid optimization:** AI decides stock vs. print for each SKU
- Aligns with your vision of questioning assumptions (**"who says this is the way to do it in the future?"**)

## Organizational Change Insight

Your observation about **"significant debt"** and **"the way we've always done it"** was honest and insightful. The platform isn't just a technology adoption—it's a **change management challenge**:

- Legacy processes (assembled pumps vs. modular components)
- Established supplier relationships (OEM dependency)
- Cultural inertia (oil & gas conservatism)

This means success requires not just technical proof, but **demonstrating that the new way is better** through irrefutable data.

## Thank You

Your reaction that the platform is **"super interesting"** while also being realistic that **"we did not consider this at all at the moment"** was the perfect balance of encouragement and honesty. 

I'm not trying to force a sale before the technology and business case are proven. Instead, I'm taking your advice: **build the 15% ROI proof with other industries, then return to OMV** when the value is undeniable.
