# Interview 18 - Andreas Leitner (OMV)
## FINAL 4-5 QUESTIONS (Carol-Focused)

**Meeting:** February 4, 2026, [TIME]  
**Time Limit:** 30 minutes = 4-5 questions MAX

---

## Q1: European Digital Inventory Costs (CRITICAL - Carol's Question)

> "From OMV's perspective as a major European oil & gas operator, what's the current cost of spare parts management?
>
> **How much does it cost** when:
> - Offshore platform downtime waiting for critical parts?
> - Maintaining physical spare parts inventory across European operations?
> - Procuring specialized parts through traditional supply chains?
>
> I need **specific $$$ data** to compare European vs North American economics: downtime €/day, inventory carrying costs, procurement lead times?"

**Listen for:** European cost data, downtime economics, regional differences

---

## Q2: Who Pays at Enterprise Scale? (CRITICAL - OMV Decision-Making)

> "For a company like OMV, who has budget authority for digital transformation / inventory optimization solutions?
>
> - Operations (offshore/refinery managers)?
> - Procurement/Supply Chain (corporate)?
> - Innovation/Digital Transformation (CTO/CDO)?
> - Finance/CFO approval required?
>
> **What ROI threshold** does OMV need? And **what's the approval process** for enterprise software vs operations spending?
>
> **Is end user (platform operators) the same as buyer (corporate HQ)?**"

**Listen for:** Enterprise buying process, budget silos, approval complexity

---

## Q3: ATEX Certification Economics (European Regulatory Burden)

> "European ATEX certification for explosive atmospheres is known to be rigorous.
>
> For AM parts in oil & gas:
> - **How much does ATEX certification cost** per part?
> - **How long does it take?** (longer than North American DNV/Lloyd's?)
> - **Who pays?** (OMV, equipment suppliers, AM contractors?)
> - **Can certification be shared** across OMV facilities, or is it site-specific?
>
> **Quantified question:** If a pre-certified parts library could cut ATEX cert time by 50%, **what would that be worth to OMV?**"

**Listen for:** ATEX cost/time data, European vs NA comparison, reusability potential

---

## Q4: AI for Innovation at OMV (Enterprise AI Adoption)

> "OMV invests in innovation and digital transformation.
>
> For AI-powered inventory optimization (predictive depletion, certification pathway guidance, part suitability scoring):
> - **Would OMV pay for this**, or expect suppliers/partners to provide it?
> - **What ROI justifies enterprise AI investment?** (cost savings %? payback period?)
> - **Is OMV building internally**, partnering with tech companies (like Equinor with Siemens), or waiting for vendors to mature?
>
> **Enterprise question:** Would you pilot with startups, or only work with established vendors (Siemens, GE, ABB)?"

**Listen for:** Enterprise partnership model, build vs buy, startup readiness

---

## Q5: Faster, Cheaper, or Better - European Perspective? (IF TIME)

> "If you could change ONE thing about OMV's spare parts management:
> - Make it **faster** (reduce lead times)?
> - Make it **cheaper** (lower total costs)?
> - Make it **better** (regulatory compliance + reliability)?
>
> From a **European regulatory + operational** perspective, which matters most? And **how much would OMV invest** to solve it?"

**Listen for:** European priorities (compliance vs cost vs speed), willingness to pay

---

## CRITICAL FOLLOW-UPS (Dig Deeper):

**If vague:** "Can you quantify that in Euros? €X downtime/day? €Y for ATEX certification?"

**If "enterprise approval is complex":** "What's the typical timeline? Who are the key stakeholders?"

**If mentions Siemens/big tech:** "Would OMV consider working with smaller companies if ROI is proven, or only large enterprise vendors?"

**End:** "Who else at OMV (offshore operations, innovation, procurement) or other European operators should I talk to?"

---

## SUCCESS = Leave with:
✅ **European cost data** (€€€ downtime, ATEX cert, inventory)  
✅ **Enterprise buying process** (who approves, what threshold)  
✅ **ATEX certification economics** (cost/time comparison)  
✅ **Enterprise partnership model** (startup vs established vendor)  
✅ **European oil & gas referrals** (Equinor, Total, Shell contacts)
