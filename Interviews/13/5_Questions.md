# Interview 13 - Lee Vessey (Thales/Canadian Navy)
## 5 QUESTIONS ONLY

**1. NAVY OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES:**
"What are the biggest spare parts challenges the Canadian Navy faces with the Arctic Patrol Vessels? Where do current solutions fall short—lead times, finding the right parts, or managing limited storage space onboard?"

**2. DIGITAL INVENTORY VISION FOR NAVAL OPERATIONS:**
"How do you see digital inventory fitting into naval operations? Would it be used for routine maintenance parts, critical mission components, or both? What would make naval operators trust and adopt a digital parts library?"

**3. CERTIFICATION AND NAVAL STANDARDS:**
"What's involved in certifying AM parts for naval use? Who manages that process—Thales, the Navy, or certification bodies? What would make certification faster or more streamlined without compromising safety?"

**4. SPACE CONSTRAINTS AND ONBOARD CAPABILITIES:**
"How do you balance space constraints on vessels—onboard AM capability vs digital library access vs traditional spare parts storage? What's the ideal mix for Arctic operations where resupply is challenging?"

**5. PARTNERSHIP AND ADOPTION PATHWAY:**
"For new technologies that could support naval operations, what's the best adoption pathway—pilot projects on specific vessels, integration with Thales systems, or working directly with Navy procurement? What would make a digital inventory platform valuable to both Thales and the Canadian Navy?"
