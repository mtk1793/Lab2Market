### **Analogy Lee Used:**
> "Like you taking your car to a garage, the Navy takes its ship to us. When it comes into the garage, we look at whether it needs maintenance and if you need some upgrades."

### **Lee's Role:**
- **Department:** Innovation Team
- **Mission:** Find ways to make service better
- **Focus:** Integrating additive manufacturing into:
  1. Inventory and supply chain
  2. Engineering for rapid prototyping and upgrades (Formula 1 team approach)

## 💡 **THE TWO CRITICAL USE CASES**

### **USE CASE 1: SUPPLY CHAIN & DIGITAL INVENTORY (E-INVENTORY)**

#### **The Vision:**

> **Direct Quote:** "I will buy the 3D model and the license for the company at the same time. And then in my e-inventory, I've got two in my warehouse and I have the license and I have the model. So I've got an unlimited warehouse of electronic of the inventory of those parts."

**Current Process:**
- Buy physical parts → Store in physical warehouse → Limited stock

**Future E-Inventory Process:**
- Buy physical parts (2 units) + 3D CAD model + printing license
- Store physical parts in warehouse
- Store digital models in e-inventory
- **Result:** "Unlimited digital warehouse"

#### **Business Benefits:**

1. **Obsolescence Solution:**
   > "Maybe the part is obsolete. For low quantities, I don't need to set up a big production run for injection molding or for casting. I can get my engineers to do it without a 20,000 quantity production run."

2. **Sovereign Resilience (MILITARY CRITICAL):**
   > "Half of our parts, maybe 1/3 of our parts come from overseas. They come from Germany, United States, Norway, Europe, all over the place. If there is a crisis, whatever the crisis—tariffs, Suez Canal ship gets blocked—the global supply chain is disrupted. My ability to fix the ship is immediately impacted unless I have the 3D models and the licenses in my e-inventory."

   **Crisis Scenarios:**
   - Tariffs (current global trade tensions)
   - Suez Canal blockages (2021 Ever Given precedent)
   - International conflicts disrupting shipping
   - Pandemic-style supply chain disruptions

   **Result:** "Gives me more sovereign resilience—really important."

3. **Reduced Lead Times:**
   - No waiting on overseas shipping
   - No customs/tariff delays
   - Print on-demand in Canada

4. **Working Capital Optimization:**
   - Reduce physical inventory carrying costs
   - Digital models cost much less to "store"
   - Only print what's needed when needed

#### **The Education Challenge:**

> **Critical Insight:** "People in our supply chain have a low knowledge about additive manufacturing. Such a low knowledge that they could not, when asked, identify items and parts that would be suitable for additive manufacturing."

**Mark Kirby's "Goldilocks" Criteria:**
- ✅ Size: About the size of a **shoebox**
- ✅ Complexity: **Single material** (not multi-material)
- ✅ Materials: Suitable for **titanium, stainless steel, bronze** (available AM materials)

**The Problem:**
- Supply chain teams **cannot** manually analyze inventory for AM suitability
- They don't understand modern (non-hobby) AM capabilities
- Need education before they can make intelligent sourcing decisions

**Dalhousie's Role:**
- Create education materials to teach supply chain about modern AM
- Enable teams to analyze inventory and identify AM candidates
- Train on part number analysis or physical description analysis

**AI Opportunity (Lee's Own Suggestion):**
> "An AI could help them do that. AI could analyze that current inventory and current supply chains, cross-refer it to materials, sizes, whatever, and produce analysis reports about 'We think these top 100 items could be [AM candidates].' And then you would want to prove that and then reinforce the cycle."

**Workflow Lee Envisions:**
1. AI analyzes inventory → Top 100 AM candidates
2. Send to Mark Kirby + Allen (Precise Design)
3. Print prototypes and certify with agencies
4. Add columns to inventory system:
   - "Is it on the shelf?" → Yes/No
   - "Is it available to print?" → Yes/No
   - "Do we have a current license to print?" → Yes/No
   - *(In time of war: "Ignore license column")* 😏

---

### **USE CASE 2: ENGINEERING RAPID PROTOTYPING & UPGRADES**

#### **The Vision:**

> **Direct Quote:** "I need our engineers to have the ability to do rapid prototyping for upgrades for the ship just like Formula 1."

**Current Problem:**
- Engineers design amazing parts (e.g., titanium instead of aluminum, beautifully designed)
- Regulatory agencies say: **"We're not ready to certify additive parts"**
- Engineers forced to use conventional manufacturing (cast, injection molded, reductive)
- **Result:** Costs more, takes longer, limits design optimization

**Why Conventional is Easier (But Worse):**
- Existing certification covers conventional manufacturers
- Agencies are comfortable with proven processes
- Even though it's more expensive and slower

**Future State (If AM is Normalized):**
- Engineers rapidly prototype in CAD
- Print titanium prototypes on-site
- Test: fire safety, strength, twist, brittleness, all properties
- Catalogue in proper system with high QC
- **Regulatory agencies accept it** because standards exist
- Formula 1-style iteration speed

#### **Example from UK Submarine Agency:**

> "They are showing on stage prototype valves, seawater valves that control the flow through a 4-inch pipe. They're showing them on stage printed out of titanium, highly designed and more silent than regular conventionally produced valves. Many, many benefits."

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Titanium (stronger, lighter, corrosion-resistant)
- ✅ Optimized design (generative design for AM)
- ✅ **More silent** (critical for submarines/stealth)
- ✅ Faster iteration (Formula 1 approach)

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL PAIN POINTS**

### **1. Normalization Barrier:**
- Maritime industry treats AM as "hobby"
- Regulatory agencies not comfortable with AM technology
- No established standards/testing/certification pathways
- **Solution:** Thales project creating the regime (Precise Design + partners)

### **2. Education Gap:**
- Supply chain teams have "low knowledge" of AM
- Cannot identify AM-suitable parts
- Don't understand modern capabilities
- **Solution:** Dalhousie education materials + AI analysis tools

### **3. Vulnerable International Supply Chain:**
- 1/3 to 1/2 of parts from overseas (Germany, US, Norway, Europe)
- Crisis scenarios disrupt supply (tariffs, blockages, conflicts)
- Long lead times for specialty parts
- **Solution:** Digital inventory with Canadian printing capability

### **4. Obsolescence Crisis:**
- Parts no longer manufactured
- Vendors no longer exist
- Cannot do low-quantity production runs economically
- **Solution:** 3D models + license = infinite supply

### **5. Slow Engineering Iteration:**
- Certification blocks rapid prototyping
- Forced to use conventional manufacturing
- Higher cost, longer time
- **Solution:** AM certification regime + testing standards

**Subject:** Circuit Board AM Solutions + Literature for Your Proposal

---

Hi Lee,

Thanks again for the fantastic conversation about the Canadian Navy AM project. I'm excited about the alignment between your work and my PhD research.

**1. Circuit Board Obsolescence Solution:**

You asked about scanning and printing circuit boards for obsolete Navy electronics. Here are three solutions:

- **Voltera (Canadian!)** - Kitchener, ON company with desktop PCB printer ($5-10K). Perfect for prototyping and simple boards in Navy workshops. (voltera.io)

- **Nano Dimension** - Industry leader in 3D-printed electronics. US DoD already using for obsolete electronics ($250K-500K for advanced multi-layer capability). (nano-di.com)

- **Reverse Engineering Services** - Companies like NCAB can scan boards, create digital files, and manufacture replacements (conventional or AM).

Happy to provide more details or connect you with Voltera (Canadian angle for your proposal!).

**2. Literature Review Findings:**

As promised, I'll start sharing any "golden" findings from my research that could support your Phase 2 proposal. First batch:

- Aviation AM certification best practices (Flightline engineering)
- Medical digital inventory models (Polyunity/Mark Kirby)
- Oil & gas digital warehouses (Equinor Norway benchmark)

Let me know what additional research would be most valuable for your white paper.

**3. Dalhousie Connection:**

I talked with my supervisor (Dr. Ali Ahmed Ali) about your project. We'd love to explore how my PhD research (AI-driven digital inventory and part identification) could support your Dalhousie partnership. My work aligns perfectly with the AI analysis and education components you described.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how I might contribute to Phase 2?

Thanks again for the intro to Allen and Mark!

Best,
Mahmoud
