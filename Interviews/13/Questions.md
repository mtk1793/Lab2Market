## QUESTION 1: Current Problem & Cost (Carol's Critical Question)

**Background:** Carol's guidance: "How are they solving it today? How much are they paying to solve it today?"

**Question:**

> "Before we dive into the digital library program, I'd love to understand the current state:
>
> - **What problem is the Arctic Patrol Vessel program trying to solve?** Is it downtime due to parts unavailability, long procurement lead times, high inventory carrying costs, or something else?
> - **How is the Canadian Navy solving this today?** What's the current spare parts procurement and storage process?
> - **How much does the current solution cost?** For example:
>   - What's the typical lead time for specialized vessel parts when ordering traditionally?
>   - How much does it cost to maintain physical spare parts inventory on naval vessels?
>   - Have you quantified the cost of downtime when a critical part isn't available?
> - **What's the minimum the Navy is doing to solve this today?** (baseline vs aspirational solution)"

**Why This Question:**
- **Carol's mandate:** Quantify customer's current cost BEFORE pitching your solution
- **Establish baseline:** Can't prove value without knowing current state
- **Budget context:** Understanding cost helps identify willingness to pay

**What You're Testing:**
- **Problem definition:** What specific pain point does digital inventory solve?
- **Current cost:** $$$ baseline to measure your platform's value against
- **Budget authority:** Who controls procurement budget in Navy?

## QUESTION 2: Buyer Identification & Willingness to Pay (Carol's Critical Question)

**Background:** Carol's guidance: "Who is willing to pay you? Where's the money coming from? Is end user = buyer?"

**Question:**

> "I'm trying to understand the decision-making process for a digital inventory platform in defense:
>
> - **Who would ultimately pay for a solution like this?** Is it Navy procurement, Thales as the contractor, or shared investment?
> - **Is the end user (Navy vessel operators) the same as the buyer (procurement decision-maker)?**
> - **What would justify the investment?** For example, if a digital inventory platform could:
>   - Reduce parts procurement lead time by 50% (from X months to Y months)
>   - Cut spare parts inventory carrying costs by 30%
>   - Eliminate Z days of downtime per year
>   
>   Which metric matters most to the person signing the check?
> - **What budget does this come from?** Operations, R&D, innovation fund, or vessel modernization?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Carol's mandate:** "At some point I'm gonna ask where's the money coming from"
- **Buyer persona:** Identify who has budget authority
- **Value proposition:** Learn which metric drives purchasing decisions

**What You're Testing:**
- **Willingness to pay:** What ROI threshold approves this type of investment?
- **Decision unit:** End user vs buyer dynamics in defense procurement
- **Budget source:** Where does money come from (affects sales strategy)

## QUESTION 3: Competitive Advantage - Faster, Cheaper, or Better? (Carol's Critical Question)

**Background:** Carol's guidance: "Can you do it faster/higher quality/cheaper? Pick one as your competitive advantage."

**Question:**

> "Based on your experience with the Thales/Cove digital library program:
>
> - **If you could change ONE thing about the current Navy spare parts system, what would it be?**
>   - Make it **faster** (reduce lead times)?
>   - Make it **cheaper** (lower procurement/inventory costs)?
>   - Make it **better** (higher reliability, less downtime)?
> - **Which of these matters most to Navy operations?** For example:
>   - Is a vessel delayed 30 days waiting for a part? (speed problem)
>   - Is carrying $X million in spare parts inventory wasteful? (cost problem)
>   - Are current parts failing prematurely, causing repeated failures? (quality problem)
> - **How much would the Navy pay to solve the #1 problem?** For instance, if you could cut lead times from 6 months to 1 month, what's that worth in operational readiness?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Carol's mandate:** Define competitive advantage (faster/cheaper/better)
- **Value quantification:** Forces specific $$$ or time savings estimates
- **Prioritization:** Reveals which problem is MOST painful

**What You're Testing:**
- **Competitive positioning:** Should platform compete on speed, cost, or quality?
- **Customer value:** Quantify benefit in Navy's terms (readiness, budget, uptime)
- **Market size:** How many vessels face this problem × cost per vessel = TAM

## QUESTION 4: Certification Costs & Timeline (Quantify the Barrier)

**Background:** Certification identified as THE barrier across 11 interviews. Need to quantify cost/time for Navy.

**Question:**

> "Certification has come up in every interview as the primary barrier to AM adoption. For the Canadian Navy program:
>
> - **How much does it cost to certify a single additive manufactured part for Navy use?** ($ estimate)
> - **How long does certification take?** (weeks, months, years?)
> - **Who pays for certification?** Navy, Thales, the AM facility, or split?
> - **Is certification reusable?** For example, if Thales certifies a valve design for one Arctic Patrol Vessel, can other Navy vessels use the same certified design without re-certifying?
> - **What would reduce certification cost/time by 50%?** Pre-certified parts library? Standardized pathways? AI-assisted compliance checking?"

**Why This Question:**
- **Quantify THE barrier:** Move from "certification is hard" → "certification costs $X and takes Y months"
- **Solution validation:** Test if pre-certified parts library resonates
- **ROI calculation:** If platform cuts cert time 50%, that = $$$ saved

**What You're Testing:**
- **Certification economics:** Actual cost/time data (benchmark for platform value prop)
- **Reusability:** Can first customer absorb cert cost, subsequent ones benefit?
- **Solution fit:** Does pre-cert library solve Navy's problem?

## FOLLOW-UP OPPORTUNITIES:

**If Lee mentions certification challenges:**
> "Dr. Nasiri at Dalhousie mentioned that oil & gas faces a 'part-by-part' certification process with no template reuse, making it costly and time-demanding. Is defense experiencing the same issue, or do you have standardized pathways?"

**If Lee mentions program is 'stalled' or 'slower than expected':**
> "What would need to change—technology, policy, budget, or something else—to accelerate adoption?"

**If Lee is enthusiastic about the program:**
> "Who else in the Canadian Navy or defense supply chain should I talk to? I'm trying to understand if lessons from this program could apply to other vessel operators (offshore oil, commercial shipping, etc.)."

**At the end:**
> "Thales is clearly at the forefront of defense digital inventory. As I build my platform for commercial sectors, would you be open to staying connected? I'd love to share findings from offshore oil & gas interviews that might inform the Navy program, and vice versa."

## KEY INSIGHTS TO LISTEN FOR:

✅ **Certification process:** DNV/Lloyd's Register (same as commercial?) or different defense standards?  
✅ **Part volume:** How many parts in Navy digital library? (benchmark for platform scope)  
✅ **Adoption barriers:** Certification, space, cost, policy, or something unique to defense?  
✅ **Onboard vs shore-based printing:** Navy strategy reveals platform design implications  
✅ **Cove partnership model:** How does innovation hub + defense contractor collaboration work?  
✅ **Timelines:** How long has program been running? When do they expect operational deployment?  
✅ **Success metrics:** How is Navy measuring success? (uptime, cost savings, readiness?)

**Strategic Goal for This Interview:**

1. **Validate H65** (Defense = second major market after oil & gas)
2. **Learn from their challenges** (don't repeat their mistakes in commercial platform)
3. **Identify partnership opportunity** (can you contribute AI/platform to Thales/Cove program?)
4. **Get more contacts** (Navy procurement, other defense contractors, Cove innovation hub leads)
