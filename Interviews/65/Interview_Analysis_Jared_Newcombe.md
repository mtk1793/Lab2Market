# Interview Analysis — Jared Newcombe (Interview #65)
**Interviewee:** Jared Newcombe  
**Position:** Chief Operating Officer, Horizon Naval Engineering  
**Date:** March 9, 2026

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Jared Newcombe, a 30+ year veteran in shipbuilding operations, offered brutally honest insights into the hidden cost drivers and operational pain points in large-scale shipyard operations. His core finding: **labor efficiency variability (60% of contract cost) combined with supplier communication gaps and subjective progress measurement create compounding cascades of delay and rework.**

Key insight: **The information needed for decision-making exists but is poorly communicated and arrives too late to act on early.**

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. Labor Efficiency, Not Materials, Is the True Cost Driver
**What he said:**
> "The largest variable that you're going to have is efficiency on labor and generally that'll make up 60% of whatever contract that you're doing, it fluctuates between 60–40 depending on if it's a new build, or if it's a repair."

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
Materials and subcontractors are fixed costs with limited variance. The volatility is labor productivity. This means:
- Reducing labor inefficiency through better coordination has massive ROI
- Rework, idle time, and schedule delays are labor cost multipliers
- Digital tools that improve labor coordination or reduce rework address the biggest lever

**Validation:** ✅ Aligns with earlier interviews about coordination overhead being hidden cost driver

### 2. Quality Ambiguity Triggers Change Orders & Cost Escalation
**What he said:**
> "The level of quality is not clearly defined in the contract term. So shipyards will generally provide the bare minimum because this is all a competitive bid...everyone tends to quote the bronze standard and then negotiate with the owner and they get them on-site as to what the minimum standard actually is. And that's typically where there's change orders."

**Real example—Repair scenario:**
> "You open the valve up, open a tank up and you find out there's a lot more work in there than was originally spent. And so you have to then negotiate with the owner as to what those repairs cost and schedule impact are going to be."

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **Quality specs are intentionally vague** because everyone bids low to win competitively
- Scope creep is baked into the contract model, not a failure
- This drives significant rework and change order management burden
- Better initial spec clarity (through AI-assisted spec generation or assessment) could reduce this friction

---

### 3. Supplier Communication Failures Are the Real Operational Risk
**What he said:**
> "The most important piece is clear, open communication from the supplier to me. So the supplier doesn't want to say they're behind schedule. They don't want to say they don't have enough people to do the work...and all of that is what's causing the problem."

**Real example—Oglama Painting ($8M contract):**
> "Within 3 months, we realized they were gross to behind schedule...lack of communication, lack of willingness to bring more people in and it was just excuse after excuse after excuse versus, here's our plan to get us back on track...I ultimately believe you're replaced...I brought them in 1 day, and I said, you're done."

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- **Suppliers hide problems rather than escalate them** (fear of penalties, loss of work)
- Management escalates to contract termination because early signals weren't trusted
- Terminating a $8M contract mid-project is catastrophically expensive (mobilization, material re-purchase, team redeployment)
- A trusted, anonymous progress tracking system could surface problems 2–3 weeks earlier

### 4. Progress Measurement Is Subjective & Delays Decision-Making
**What he said:**
> "It's subjective Vs objective, right? And so somebody can come in and say, I think I'm 10% done, but you know, where's the where's the evidence that you're actually 10% done."

**Real example:**
> "Someone's opinion rate, and so typically, then we look for 3–4–5 weeks of bad bad numbers. And then I can say I have a trend and now we have a problem so that may be...not necessarily too late. But it's we'd like to be able to solidify that confidence a little bit earlier in that process than we're currently doing it."

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Progress is reported qualitatively ("I think I'm 10% done")
- Management waits 3–4 weeks of data before acting to avoid false positives
- This 3–4 week lag means problems are compounded before response
- **Objective progress measurement (photos, sensor data, work logs) could accelerate decision confidence by 2+ weeks**

---

### 5. Procurement Front-End Bottlenecks Occur When Specs Are Unclear
**What he said:**
> "The majority of time is lost on the front end...typically, you know, you'll focus on the critical path items. First, and then you'll expand out into other paths that have varying degrees of float...Finding the material that is properly specked for the work that's required is generally where you're going to find the most impacts on the front end."

**What happens when specs are wrong:**
> "As you work through a contract and you find chain orders...there's a lot of interruption like that that we find through it in normal repair scope...I've got to take those 5 or 6 guys that I had on that scope of work and find a new home from them for that period of time."

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Procurement cycle time is not primarily a vendor response issue; it's a **specification clarity issue**
- Rework and team reassignment due to unclear specs creates cascading delays
- Better upfront spec validation or automated spec comparison could reduce procurement cycle time

### 6. Supplier Performance Data Exists But Arrives Late
**What he said:**
> "The information is all there, it's readily available...You know, the vendor's not performing because I've got indicators on my schedule that say slipping behind schedule."

**But:**
> "Tightening that up so that you know, in week one when I'm told that there are 2% behind schedule like right now. I have this thought that my well. That's just somebody reported the progress wrong. It'll catch up next week."

**Implication for AddManuChain:**
- Weekly progress reports exist but require 3–4 weeks to create confidence
- Real-time or daily progress data with confidence scoring could eliminate lag
- The decision information isn't missing; the confidence in early signals is missing

---

## ALIGNMENT WITH HYPOTHESIS

**Original Hypothesis:** Digital orchestration at the procurement/operational intersection would have high ROI if it could flag supplier/schedule risk 2–4 weeks early.

**Jared's validation:** ✅ **Strongly confirmed.**
- He explicitly wants to "solidify confidence a little bit earlier in that process"
- 3–4 week lag while waiting for trend confirmation is unacceptable
- A tool that provides objective progress measurement with early confidence would directly address this gap

---

## OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENT

### High-ROI Opportunity Areas:

1. **Objective Progress Measurement** (High Impact, High Feasibility)
   - Current: Subjective weekly reports, 3–4 week lag to decision
   - Proposed: Photo/sensor-based progress tracking with AI-powered progress estimation
   - Jared's need: "Solidify that confidence a little bit earlier"
   - ROI: Could reduce problem detection lag from 3–4 weeks to 1 week = 2–3 weeks earlier action window

2. **Supplier Communication Platform** (High Impact, Medium Feasibility)
   - Current: Suppliers hide problems due to fear
   - Proposed: Anonymous or low-risk escalation mechanism for supplier to flag early
   - Jared's pain point: "Suppliers don't want to say they're behind schedule"
   - ROI: Could enable $8M contract partners to escalate issues vs. hide them

3. **Specification Clarity & Validation** (High Impact, Medium Feasibility)
   - Current: Vague specs → competitive bidding on bronze standard → change orders
   - Proposed: AI-assisted spec validation, comparison, and ambiguity detection upfront
   - Jared's pain: "Finding material that is properly specced" is biggest front-end bottleneck
   - ROI: Reduce procurement cycle time, eliminate rework from spec mismatches

4. **Additive Manufacturing for Spare/Replacement Parts** (Moderate Impact, Lower Current Relevance)
   - Jared's response: "It's not that old school is fine. It's that we are often bound by the specification that the client submits."
   - **Key insight:** Client specifications are the constraint, not yards' willingness to adopt new tech
   - AM for spares could help, but only if client specs allow
   - Relevant for: Short-lead-time replacement parts during repairs (e.g., gaskets, small fittings)
   - Not relevant for: Structural components, regulatory-bound parts

---

## RED FLAGS / CONCERNS

1. **Client Specification as Blocker**
   - Jared: "I prefer clarity rather than ambiguity. So I would much rather have the client say to me that I want 10 MacBook pros, I don't want a Dell."
   - **Implication:** Shipyard cannot unilaterally adopt AM; needs client buy-in and spec modification
   - Your MVP may need to include client-side tools (spec templates, AM-compatible part listings)

2. **Hesitation on New Tech Adoption**
   - Jared: "From a shipyard's perspective, we prefer clarity rather than ambiguity."
   - **Implication:** Adoption will be slow unless the tool reduces ambiguity, not adds it
   - Your platform must be **simpler and clearer than current processes**, not more complex

3. **AI Skepticism Among Team**
   - Jared is personally open to AI, but represents a mature executive mindset
   - Younger/technical teams may have different concerns (job displacement, black boxes)
   - Training and change management will be necessary

## ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS

1. **Create a pilot for objective progress measurement**
   - Partner with a repair contract at Horizon
   - Use daily photo uploads + AI-powered work estimation
   - Compare Jared's current 3–4 week confidence lag vs. accelerated detection

2. **Map Jared's supplier communication pain points**
   - Interview 2–3 of his major suppliers (painting, mechanical, electrical)
   - Understand what prevents early escalation
   - Test anonymous or low-risk escalation mechanism

3. **Spec validation tool proof-of-concept**
   - Take 5 recent project specs from Horizon
   - Identify ambiguities using AI (quality undefined, material unclear, duplication)
   - Show Jared cost/schedule impact of each ambiguity
   - Propose AI-powered spec clarity check as upfront tool

4. **Validate AM applicability**
   - Survey 10 recent repair projects—which parts would benefit from on-site/rapid production?
   - Check regulatory constraints (certifications, material standards)
   - Estimate time/cost savings for AM vs. traditional procurement
