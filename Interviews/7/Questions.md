## Strategic Interview Questions

### 1. The Certification Bottleneck Reality Check

**Question:**

> "Tell me about a recent metal AM certification request that took longer than expected. What caused the delay?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Where in the timeline did it slow down—was it the technical testing or the administrative coordination?"
- "How much time do you estimate NRC spends on admin work versus actual technical evaluation?"
- "If you could eliminate ONE bottleneck in the certification process, what would it be?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real delay story reveals TRUE bottlenecks (not assumptions)
- **CRITICAL VALIDATION** of H30 (reduce admin time 60%) and H7 (efficient certifications)
- Quantifies admin burden as percentage of total time
- Identifies highest-value automation opportunity

**Hypotheses tested:** H30 (VP.6 - reduce admin time), H7 (CJ.3 - process certifications efficiently)

### 2. The "Part Categorization Algorithm" Feasibility Test

**Question:**

> "When someone brings you a part design and asks if it's suitable for metal AM, what do you look at first?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Is that assessment something that could be automated with AI if it had all the technical data?"
- "What nuances would AI miss that only an expert metallurgist would catch?"
- "Has NRC considered using AI tools to screen requests before human review?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real assessment process reveals decision criteria
- Tests technical feasibility of H54 (AI feasibility assessment) AND H50 (part categorization)
- Validates from THE domain expert whether AI can handle this
- Identifies what's automatable vs. what requires human expertise

**Hypotheses tested:** H54 (feasibility assessment AI), H50 (risk categorization system)

---

### 3. The Distributed Manufacturing Quality Paradox

**Question:**

> "Has NRC ever certified multiple facilities to produce the same AM part to the same specification? How did that go?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "What's the biggest challenge in ensuring different facilities produce identical parts?"
- "Is it machine calibration, operator training, process control, or something else?"
- "Is consistency across distributed facilities even achievable with current AM technology?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real multi-site experience reveals ACTUAL consistency challenges (not theory)
- Tests core assumption of distributed manufacturing for regulated industries
- Validates H32 (standardized quality) feasibility
- Identifies whether this is technical barrier or process barrier

**Hypotheses tested:** H32 (standardized quality), H8 (enable distributed manufacturing for OEMs)

---

### 4. Digital Certification Data Sharing

**Question:**

> "When aerospace manufacturers want to verify a facility's NRC certifications, how do they currently check that?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Do they call NRC? Check a database? Ask the facility for documentation?"
- "Would it be valuable to have instant digital verification of certifications?"
- "What barriers would prevent NRC from sharing that data through a third-party platform—legal, privacy, competitive concerns?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Current verification process reveals workaround pain (or lack thereof)
- Tests feasibility of H27 (one-click compliance proof) and H31 (real-time tracking)
- Validates whether NRC would partner with platform
- Identifies legal/policy barriers to data sharing

**Hypotheses tested:** H27 (VP.3 - one-click compliance proof), H31 (VP.7 - real-time compliance tracking)

---

### 5. The "Research-to-Market Gap" Bridge

**Question:**

> "Tell me about an NRC metal AM innovation that took a long time to be adopted by industry. What slowed down the adoption?"

**Follow-ups:**
- "Was it lack of awareness, cost, risk aversion, regulatory barriers, or something else?"
- "How long typically from NRC development to widespread industry use?"
- "Could a platform connecting researchers, facilities, and manufacturers speed that up?"

**Why ask:** 
- **JTBD Application:** Real adoption story reveals TRUE barriers (not assumptions)
- Explores whether AddManuChain could solve problem Dr. Wanjara personally cares about
- Tests platform as technology transfer accelerator (new value prop)
- Validates potential partnership/advisor relationshipative source
- Opens door to collaboration/advisory role discussion

**Hypotheses tested:** NEW - AddManuChain as research-to-industry bridge, NEW - barriers to aerospace AM adoption

## Follow-Up / Probing Questions

### On certification/regulatory:
- "How many certification requests does NRC Aerospace handle annually? Is demand growing?"
- "What percentage of your team's time is spent on actual testing vs. administrative coordination?"
- "Would automated scheduling and digital reporting actually reduce burden, or just shift work around?"

### On technical feasibility:
- "What are the 'disqualifying factors' that make a part unsuitable for metal AM in aerospace?"
- "Could those factors be codified into rules an AI could follow?"
- "What mistakes would an AI likely make that a human metallurgist wouldn't?"

### On industry adoption:
- "Which aerospace part categories are 'ripe' for AM adoption right now?"
- "What's preventing wider AM adoption—technical readiness, certification costs, or cultural conservatism?"
- "Do aerospace OEMs ask NRC to help them find qualified AM suppliers?"

### On platform collaboration:
- "If AddManuChain integrated with NRC's certification data (with appropriate permissions), what value could that provide to industry?"
- "Would you be open to advising a platform like this to ensure it meets aerospace industry standards?"
- "What would make you recommend such a platform to your industry partners?"

## Research Context & Closing Statement

**When to share:** After questions, when discussing collaboration opportunities

### Project Introduction

> "I've asked these questions because my PhD research is building **AddManuChain**, a platform designed to connect aerospace and other manufacturers with certified AM facilities while automating compliance verification and quality assurance. Your perspective is uniquely valuable because you sit at the intersection of **certification authority** (NRC), **technical expertise** (23 years in metal AM), and **industry collaboration** (working with aerospace OEMs). One of our core hypotheses is that digital certification tracking and AI-driven quality assessment could accelerate aerospace AM adoption while maintaining the rigorous standards that NRC upholds. I'd be honored if you'd consider advising the project or exploring ways NRC and AddManuChain could collaborate to help Canadian aerospace manufacturers adopt AM more confidently and efficiently."
