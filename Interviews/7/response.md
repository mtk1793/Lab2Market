Thank you for reaching out. Your research topic on digital inventory management and the AM supply chain is very timely, particularly in the context of highly regulated industries.
 
While I cannot speak specifically for Québec-based additive manufacturing companies alone, I can share some recent ecosystem-level insights that may be relevant to your requirement analysis phase.
 
Earlier this year, PRIMA Québec conducted a survey among their members to better understand their perspective on technology adoption. They received 39 responses out of 146 organizations contacted; only one respondent was directly active in additive manufacturing, but the dataset is representative of the broader advanced materials sector. Nearly all respondents expressed interest in adopting new technologies, and a majority reported having adopted new technologies within the past five years. Specifically, 77% reported adopting digital tools, and 60% reported adoption of AI or machine learning technologies.
 
When asked about barriers to technology adoption, the most frequently cited challenges were investment costs (89%), uncertainty regarding return on investment (55%), workforce shortages (32%), and lack of adequate support or guidance (21%). These barriers would likely apply equally—if not more strongly—to a transition toward digital, on-demand inventory systems.
 
In addition, by cross-referencing our internal database with data from Québec’s Digital Transformation Offensive program, we observed that only about 20% of companies in the advanced materials sector (out of a total of 619) have benefited from this initiative. This suggests a combination of limited awareness and, in some cases, limited perceived relevance or readiness for digital transformation.
 
Based on these observations, I tend to think that Québec companies still face a significant lag in digital adoption, and the additive manufacturing sector appears to face challenges similar to those encountered across the broader advanced materials ecosystem.
