## Recommended Next Steps

### Interview Strategy

**If Pursuing as Interview:**
- **Segment:** Hybrid - CS.3 (Labs & Networks) + Industry Facilitator
- **Focus Questions:**
  - What are the top 3 barriers preventing Quebec manufacturers from adopting AM? (Get specific stories)
  - How do companies currently find certified AM facilities in Quebec?
  - What role does R&D funding play in AM adoption decisions?
  - How does CQFA currently connect manufacturers with AM providers?
  - Would a digital platform add value to CQFA's services, or compete with them?

**If Pursuing as Partnership:**
- Position AddManuChain as **complementary digital infrastructure** for CQFA's network
- Offer to integrate CQFA-certified facilities with priority visibility
- Explore co-marketing opportunity: "CQFA-Verified Facilities on AddManuChain"

### Key Hypotheses to Test

- **H25:** Do Quebec manufacturers struggle to find qualified AM facilities? (Validation from CQFA perspective)
- **H7:** Does certification tracking reduce friction? (Test if SR&ED documentation is parallel pain point)
- **NEW:** Does R&D tax credit complexity slow AM adoption?
- **H32:** Can CQFA network serve as initial test case for standardized quality across distributed facilities?
