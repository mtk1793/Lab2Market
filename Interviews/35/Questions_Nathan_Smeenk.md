## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: Canada's AM Landscape — Current State & Gaps 🇨🇦
**"You've been at Agile Manufacturing for 20 years, building it into Canada's largest 3D printing service bureau. From your vantage point — where is additive manufacturing in Canada right now? What are the biggest gaps between what the technology can do and what customers are actually adopting? And specifically for industrial applications like oil & gas, marine, and defence — how much demand do you see?"**

#### Why This Matters
- Need to understand the **supply side** of AM in Canada — we know the demand side from our customer interviews
- Identifies whether Agile could be a **manufacturing partner** or **competitor**
- Tests whether industrial/marine/defence AM is real or still aspirational

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Industrial demand growing**: "We're seeing more inquiries from oil & gas, marine, and defence for production parts"
- ✅ **Gap identified**: "The technology is ready, but customers don't know what to print or how to certify it"
- ✅ **Certification barrier confirmed**: "Getting parts qualified for industrial use is where most projects stall"
- ✅ **Partnership opportunity**: "We have the capacity but need someone to bring us the right customers and applications"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Industrial AM is 10 years away" or "We mostly do prototyping, not production"

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What percentage of your work is prototyping vs. end-use production parts?"
- "Are you seeing demand from the oil & gas or marine sectors specifically?"
- "What's the biggest order you've ever done for industrial end-use parts?"
- "Who are your competitors in Canada for production AM parts?"
- "Is Agile profitable? What's the business model — per-part pricing, subscription, or project-based?"

### Q2: Technical Capabilities — What Can You Print for Offshore/Marine? ⚙️
**"If I gave you a part spec from an offshore oil platform — say a valve housing, a pump impeller, a structural bracket, or a pipe fitting — could Agile print it? What materials do you work with, and which of your technologies (SLS, SLA, FDM) is best suited for industrial marine components that need to withstand saltwater, pressure, and temperature extremes?"**

#### Why This Matters
- Validates whether Agile's current capability matches our target applications
- Tyler Beatty mentioned specific offshore parts — can Agile actually make them?
- Understanding materials is critical for certification discussions

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Metals capability**: "We do metal printing — stainless steel, Inconel, titanium"
- ✅ **Polymer strength**: "Industrial nylons and PEEK can handle marine environments"
- ✅ **Post-processing**: "We do heat treatment, machining, and surface finishing to meet specs"
- ✅ **Limitations acknowledged**: "We can do X and Y, but for Z you'd need a metals-focused bureau"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We mostly do plastic prototypes" (wrong capability level)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Do you do metal AM, or just polymers?"
- "What's the strongest material you can print? Can it meet offshore pressure ratings?"
- "Have you ever printed a part that went into a marine or offshore application?"
- "What's your build envelope — can you handle large components?"
- "Do you offer quality assurance / inspection reports (CMM, CT scanning, material certifications)?"

---

### Q3: The Certification & Quality Challenge 📋
**"One thing we keep hearing from the oil & gas and marine sectors is that the #1 barrier to AM adoption isn't the technology — it's certification. Class societies like Lloyd's and DNV haven't fully figured out how to certify AM parts. From Agile's perspective as a service bureau — do your customers ask about certification? How do you handle quality assurance and traceability? And is the lack of standards holding back your industrial business?"**

#### Why This Matters
- Every interview validates certification as THE barrier — does the service bureau see it too?
- Understanding Agile's QA/traceability infrastructure tells us whether they could be a **certified production partner**
- Shawn Sooley's "Aerospace First" strategy — has Agile pursued aerospace certification (AS9100, Nadcap)?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Certification is a barrier**: "Yes, customers want certified parts but we can't always provide the paperwork they need"
- ✅ **QA infrastructure**: "We do material traceability, process documentation, and inspection"
- ✅ **Standards gap**: "There's no clear standard for AM production parts — it's the Wild West"
- ✅ **Willing to certify**: "If there was a clear certification pathway, we'd invest in it"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We don't do any quality documentation" (can't be a production partner)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Do you hold any certifications — ISO 9001, AS9100, Nadcap?"
- "Do customers ever require material certificates or test reports with their parts?"
- "Have you worked with class societies (Lloyd's, DNV, Bureau Veritas) or defence standards (MIL-SPEC)?"
- "What would it cost Agile to get certified for production parts in marine/defence?"
- "Is there a traceability system — can you track every part back to raw material batch and process parameters?"

### Q4: Digital Inventory & On-Demand Manufacturing Model 💻
**"We're building a platform called AddManuChain — a digital inventory system where operators can store certified part designs and have them printed on-demand when needed, rather than stockpiling physical inventory. The idea is to connect the operator's digital library to qualified print service bureaus like Agile. From your operational perspective — does this model make sense? Would Agile be interested in being a production partner in a network like this?"** Ask LAST!!!!

#### Why This Matters
- This is the **direct pitch** to test whether Agile would be a manufacturing partner
- Tests whether the service bureau model aligns with on-demand production
- Identifies operational concerns (lead times, capacity, consistency)

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Interest**: "That's exactly what the industry needs — we have the capacity, we just need qualified demand"
- ✅ **Operational fit**: "We could handle on-demand orders with 24-48 hour turnaround for most parts"
- ✅ **Network interest**: "Being part of a qualified network would bring us customers we can't reach on our own"
- ✅ **Concerns raised**: Lead time expectations, pricing model, IP protection, quality standards
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We'd rather work directly with customers" (channel conflict)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's your typical turnaround time from file to finished part?"
- "How much spare capacity do you have — could you handle a surge of on-demand orders?"
- "What would your pricing model look like — per part, per hour, per build?"
- "How do you feel about IP protection — could you work with encrypted files that you print but don't own?"
- "Would you need a minimum order threshold, or could you handle one-off parts?"
- "Who else is trying to build this kind of network — have you seen competitors do this?"

### Q5: Scaling & Future Vision — Where Is AM Going? 🚀
**"Agile went from a startup to 18,000 square feet with 29 employees — the largest AM bureau in Canada. Where do you see the next phase of growth? Is it more of the same (bigger, more machines), or is there a shift toward production manufacturing, certified parts, or distributed networks? And what's the biggest opportunity you see in the next 3-5 years?"**

#### Why This Matters
- Understanding Agile's growth trajectory tells us if they're moving toward or away from our value proposition
- If they're already thinking "distributed production network" → they could become a competitor
- If they're focused on capacity → they're a natural partner

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Production shift**: "We're moving from prototyping to end-use production — that's where the real growth is"
- ✅ **Network thinking**: "We've thought about distributed production, but we don't have the platform for it"
- ✅ **Certification investment**: "We're preparing for ISO/AS9100 because customers are demanding it"
- ✅ **Industry sectors**: Which industries they're targeting for growth
- ❌ **Red flag**: "We're building our own digital platform" (direct competitor)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Are you investing in new technologies (metal printers, larger format, new materials)?"
- "What industries are driving your growth right now?"
- "Have you explored government contracts — defence, aerospace, naval?"
- "Is Agile looking at expanding beyond the Toronto area — East Coast, West Coast?"
- "What's your biggest operational challenge right now — capacity, talent, materials, customers?"

## BONUS QUESTION

### BONUS Q1: The AMUG Connection & Industry Trends 🌐
**"I noticed Gary Rabinovitz from AMUG endorsed your rapid prototyping skills. You're clearly connected to the broader AM community. From an industry trends perspective — what are you hearing about digital inventory platforms, distributed manufacturing networks, and AM-as-a-service models? Is there momentum behind these concepts, or is it still early days?"**

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Are service bureaus in the US or Europe further ahead on production AM?"
- "What did you learn at the last AMUG conference about industrial AM adoption?"
- "Are there consolidators trying to build networks of service bureaus?"
