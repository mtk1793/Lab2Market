## Introduction & Background

**Michael:** Hello! How's everything? Thank you very much. I just sent you an email — I thought some kind of problem happened and you couldn't connect to each other. I'm so happy you're here right now. So would that be okay if I start this meeting?

As I told you in the email, my name is Mahmoud Kiasari, and I'm doing my PhD at Dalhousie University, Canada. Around 2 years ago I was working with a company — they were working in 3D printing and additive manufacturing. I came up with an idea about building an ecosystem between different kinds of entities working on digital inventory, and after that, working with AI.

Recently, I got accepted in a program named Lab2Market. In this program, I have to talk with at least 100 people from different perspectives and expertise in order to validate my work — to see if it's going to be acceptable for the market or not. That's why I reached out to you guys.

**Nathan:** Yeah, sure. You've already left me with some questions. We — **Agile's 20 years in the 3D printing market, 22 I think**, and even more experience in that prior to Agile. **Everything plastic, a little bit metal.**

From producing parts for people, through **reverse engineering, some CAD offerings, and buying, selling printers — new, used — servicing printers, material sales.** Kind of **every real sort of facet** as a Canadian company needs to be.

Been with the company pretty much since inception — from **2 guys at a desk through to a couple of facilities.** I'd say **40,000 square feet in total and 16 employees** across both.

## Q1: Canada's AM Landscape — Current State & Gaps

**Michael:** So my first question would be about the idea and the futuristic point of additive manufacturing. From your point of view, where is additive manufacturing in Canada right now? What are the gaps between what the technology can do and what customers are actually going to adopt?

**Nathan:** **I don't think there's so much gap of technology. It's a gap of finance.**

**Michael:** Very interesting that you mention finance. I had in mind that the #1 thing keeping Canadian companies from adopting AM was certification and regulations. So you're mentioning finance. How is the other side? What about certification?

**Nathan:** **There's not a lot of certification yet in the field. It's really, really kind of new.** And a lot of the certification in our industry is really finding its origin with **private companies.** You know, take an oil and gas company that is trying to work through certifying machines and materials to be able to produce their own end-use parts.

From an industry perspective, the OEMs — the machine manufacturers — **haven't really done a lot of that.**

**Michael:** So obviously you deal with Lloyd's Register and DNV, right? You work with those guys?

**Nathan:** **I don't know what those are.**

**Michael:** Oh, really? In oil and gas, Lloyd's Register and DNV are part of the certifications — people who certify products that are either based on AM or the normal way of work.

**Nathan:** **Our clients that are in that industry may very well be doing so. But we don't.**

## Q2: Technical Capabilities — What Can Agile Print?

**Michael:** If I give you a part spec from an offshore oil platform — a valve, or maybe a pump, or any other kind of parts — could Agile print it? What materials do you work with? And which type of technologies are you using?

**Nathan:** Oh, that's — all that's just basic stuff off our website. **We work with pretty much all the plastics technologies.**

**Michael:** What about the metal parts?

**Nathan:** **We don't do metal in-house.**

## Q3: Future Growth & Democratization of 3D Printing

**Michael:** You started from the beginning as a small company and now Agile is the biggest in Canada. Where do you see the next phase of growth?

**Nathan:** It's kind of part of the 5-year plan, right? What we really are doing — **we've sort of maximized our manufacturing offering.** And so what we're really trying to do is **add to the edges, streamline our processes — simply better the offering that we have.**

In addition, what I found interesting in the 3D printing space is that **the democratization of 3D printing is, by the way, here, functionally.** Something discussed for what, 15 years now? And really only in the last couple of years — whether it's **the standardization that Bambu has brought to the FDM vertical** or **Formlabs to the home-use resin.**

In an industrial space like ours, we haven't typically looked at the smaller, home-use type of units. **But because they are now being used en masse, we're looking to add those offerings.**

**We've always believed in offering what is requested of us instead of building it and hoping they come.** Working towards identifying where we see demand and addressing that demand.

And then looking forward to some of the ancillary offerings — whether it's **reverse engineering, or higher levels of finishing on the back end, or broadening our material offering.** Those are all individual areas that have been action items over the last number of months and will continue to be.

**Eric (colleague):** And really, I think automation too — finding where automation can benefit, especially the post-processing aspect, but the whole thing really. Even software-related stuff as well.

## AI & Machine Learning in AM

**Michael:** How much do you think these technologies can adopt themselves using machine learning and AI? I thought it would also be beneficial if we can use that in 3D printing and AM or maybe the concept of digital inventory. How much do you have a vision that AI could have a place?

**Eric:** I think there is, **with the setup aspects of 3D printing** — like prepping the files for printing. **It requires a lot of human decision-making**, and something that general software hasn't been able to accomplish to the point where it's perfect.

I think that is where maybe **AI, if there was a focus on developing a model for that specifically, you might see a massive benefit.** Kind of take — instead of people looking at parts and setting up parts and preparing them — **having the machine do all that.** That's the biggest area for sure where it could benefit, in my eyes.

## The AddManuChain Pitch — Digital Inventory Discussion

**Michael:** The idea we've been developing is about building an ecosystem between different entities — the end users as clients, the OEMs, 3D printing facilities, and also authorities and regulations. Throughout this, we would like to also work on digital inventory. After COVID, everything changed. We thought maybe we can encourage different industries to shift their focus — instead of just having physical inventory, try to make at least part of it, noncritical parts obviously, into digital inventory.

**Nathan:** Yeah, **the digital inventory thing — that's well underway.** And who has access to it is always interesting. But I tell you what I find —

**During COVID, what would have served the world well was having a physical inventory readily deliverable.** If somebody wants something, if it exists, you can get it to them within hours. If you have to make it, it takes longer. If you can print it, it takes less time than traditional manufacturing.

**But I think people have to be careful of the value of digital inventory over real inventory.**

**Michael:** The thing about the OEMs — they don't like to share their IP. That completely makes sense, because it's not very safe to share it with others while you're not sure it's going to leak or not.

**Nathan:** You know, **what's the name of the digital inventory that the oil and gas companies share?**

**Michael:** I don't know about that, I'm not sure.

**Nathan:** **It already exists. But what it shares with you is the file, right? And a file doesn't serve you any purpose.** You need to know:
- How it was set up
- What machine it was on
- What all the parameters were

**So it's kind of a nice little bit of lipstick on a problem.** So it's — thanks for the file, but **it's more of a problem than a solution.**

## Network Model & Existing Players

**Michael:** Another thing that we would like to offer in this platform is to help people access the nearest, the closest 3D printing facilities by using our platform. We would like to try to reduce the downtime costs.

**Nathan:** Yeah, so you have the digital inventory, which is one company, one entity and it shares the files. The other one is exactly what you say — **the network. Persecu — 3D.**

**Michael:** Yeah, I've heard about them.

**Nathan:** **They share the inventory of production.** Reality is, **they use the couriers that deliver food and supplies to the oil platforms.** So they're already still moving things great distances, as opposed to on the spot.

**I guess my point is that these are things that have been in place, poorly, for a long time. How do you make it better?**

**Michael:** I was talking with a company named RUTH in Europe, and they're actually implementing this idea for a couple of years. The thing that I found out is that those companies haven't been in touch with Canadian companies. He just mentioned they had a project in Toronto. So I would really like to be at least one of the companies that could have this idea and make it Canada-based, because the idea is not new — it's been there for a couple of years — but we would like to make it localized inside Canada.

**Nathan:** Well, **we share the same goal. My goal is to have outposts of Agile across the country so people can produce their parts locally.** That said, **the couriers do make sure everybody gets their parts within 24 hours.** So it's not the end of the world.

## James Jack & Closing

**Michael:** I was also in touch with Mr. James Jack — he's also working in your company, right? I would like to know, do you think Mr. Jack can give me other insights from other perspectives?

**Nathan:** **Oh, he's more negative than I am.** So proceed at your own peril. **James is in sales and marketing, so you'll get a sales and marketing perspective.**

## Closing & Follow-Up

**Michael:** Thank you very much for sharing all of your insights with me. I have 2 small favors. First — if you have someone in your contacts who could help me through this way, I'd really appreciate an introduction. Second — in the future, maybe I find out no, this idea doesn't work, and I use my knowledge to shift to another direction. Could I shoot you an email and ask for another 15 minutes?

**Nathan:** Yes, okay. Fine.

**Michael:** Do you have any one last piece of advice for me?

**Nathan:** Um. No, I'm good.

**Michael:** Anything works — I really need honest advice. Even if at some point you say it doesn't work at all.

**Nathan:** Actually, let me — oh, Christmas — look, **I have a list of the actual names of the companies that I was mentioning that have the centralized/decentralized structure in place now.** I'll pass that on to you by email.

**Michael:** That would be fantastic. Thank you very much for the time. Have a super great day. Bye.
