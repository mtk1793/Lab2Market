## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

Lonita is the **COO of Horizon Maritime** — one of Atlantic Canada's leading marine services companies operating in offshore oil & gas. This interview sits at the intersection of three of our most important angles:

1. **Marine operations buyer perspective** — Horizon Maritime operates vessels for offshore O&G. She understands both the operational and compliance side of parts, equipment, and downtime.
2. **HSE + certification expertise** — As a CRSP and NEBOSH-certified professional, she understands safety certification from the operator side. This directly informs how our "Certification-as-a-Service" messaging will land.
3. **NL offshore insider** — St. John's-based, Horizon Maritime works in the same waters as Hibernia, Hebron, and eventually Bay du Nord. This is our core target geography.

**Key question to answer:** From the COO of a marine services firm, how does the reality of spare parts management, downtime risk, and HSE compliance intersect? What would convince an operator like Horizon Maritime to trust a digital parts supply chain?

## INTERVIEW GOALS

- [ ] Understand Horizon Maritime's spare parts management pain (lead times, downtime cost, inventory)
- [ ] Test "breakdown insurance" framing with a COO who owns both operations AND safety
- [ ] Understand how HSE certification requirements interact with parts sourcing decisions
- [ ] Validate or challenge our AM certification strategy from the operator's compliance perspective
- [ ] Get referrals into other Horizon Maritime contacts or peer companies in NL marine services

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

**Q1 — The spare parts problem in marine operations:**
> *"Horizon Maritime operates vessels in some of the harshest offshore conditions in the world. When a critical part fails at sea — or on an offshore asset — what does the response process actually look like? Who makes the call? What's the average time-to-resolution, and what does unplanned downtime cost you in real terms?"*

**Q2 — Safety certification and parts sourcing:**
> *"You're a CRSP and the COO. When a part is sourced — especially a non-OEM or aftermarket part — what's the certification and sign-off process on the safety side? Who owns the liability if an uncertified part fails? How would you feel about a platform that pre-certifies AM-printed parts through Lloyd's Register before they're ever ordered?"*

**Q3 — The "Certification-as-a-Service" pitch:**
> *"One of our core pieces is handling the DNV/Lloyd's Register certification process on behalf of the operator — so a platform user would never see a certification form. They'd just order a certified part and receive it. From your role as COO managing both operations and compliance, does that model solve a real problem, or would your team still need to be directly involved in the certification process?"*

**Q4 — Inventory reality check:**
> *"We've heard from offshore operators that ships carrying $30–50M in physical spare parts inventory is normal. Is that consistent with Horizon Maritime's experience? And what's the cost — financial and operational — of that inventory sitting idle? Is there appetite to reduce that footprint?"*

**Q5 — Barriers to adopting AM parts:**
> *"If we came to you today with a platform that could produce a certified replacement part in 48 hours through a Lloyd's Register-qualified facility in St. John's — what would your first three objections be? What would need to be true before you'd move a part from your physical inventory to a digital one?"*

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

**B1 — Remote Access Technology background:**
> *"You spent time at Remote Access Technology as Director of Safety and Quality. That name suggests technology for remote or hard-to-access environments — which is exactly our core market. What types of remote operations challenges did you encounter there related to equipment, parts, and maintenance? Was digital supply chain ever discussed as a solution?"*

## CONTEXT TO SHARE WITH LONITA

- AddManuChain: digital spare parts inventory + AM production + certification-as-a-service for offshore, naval, and Arctic operations
- Lloyd's Register just certified Atlantic XL (St. John's) as the first AM facility in the Americas — our anchor manufacturing partner
- We've spoken with Equinor, Lloyd's Register, Irving Shipbuilding, C-CORE, CME NL
- Our thesis: 1–2% of capex in spare parts protects 98% of production (Equinor's own framing)
- Certification is our differentiator — people use FieldNode for connectivity; we sell trust
