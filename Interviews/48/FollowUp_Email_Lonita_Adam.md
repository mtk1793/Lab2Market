# Follow-up Email: Lonita Judge (Horizon Maritime)

**Subject:** Thank You + AddManuChain & Shipyard Introductions (Lab2Market)

**Body:**

Hi Lonita and Adam,

Thank you both so much for taking the time to speak with me yesterday. The insights you shared from the operator perspective at Horizon and Rosen Maritime were incredibly valuable for our Lab2Market customer discovery.

Adam, your point about downtime costing upwards of $50,000 to $100,000 per day really reinforced the need for rapid part replacement. Lonita, your comment about the challenges of long lead times for operations in remote areas like the Arctic perfectly highlights the exact pain point we are trying to solve with AddManuChain. It was also very helpful to understand your equipment deduplication strategy, rather than maintaining massive physical inventories. 

As we refine our platform to focus primarily on non-critical, at-spec components (like the bearings Adam mentioned) to avoid the heavy regulatory burden of older, custom-machined parts, we are now looking to speak with the builders and manufacturers who supply the vessels. 

Lonita, at the end of our call, you generously mentioned that you might be able to introduce me to a couple of contacts at shipyards. I would be extremely grateful for any connections you could facilitate. Speaking with shipyard operators will help us understand the supply-side economics of providing these digital inventory solutions. 

Thank you again for your time, candor, and support of our project. 

Best regards,

Mahmoud (Michael) Kiasari
