Hi Lonita,

Thank you so much for the introduction! I sincerely appreciate you connecting me with Jared—this is exactly the kind of shipyard perspective we are looking for.

Hi Jared,

It’s great to meet you. As Lonita mentioned, I am currently leading a project called AddManuChain through the Lab2Market Oceans program. We are working on a secure digital inventory platform to enable localized, certified 3D printing of spare parts for the maritime and offshore sectors, with a primary goal of compressing lead times and minimizing operational downtime.

Given your extensive executive leadership experience at Chantier Davie, Ontario Shipyards, and now as COO at Horizon Naval Engineering / NewDock, your perspective on how shipyards and repair facilities currently handle custom replacement parts—and the viability of digital warehousing—would be incredibly valuable to our research.

I would love to take you up on your offer for a brief 15-minute conversation. Please let me know what days or times work best for your schedule next week, and I will gladly accommodate.

I look forward to speaking with you!

Best regards,

Mahmoud (Michael) Kiasari
