Speaker 1  (00:53)
And if I knew, oh hi, oh sorry, it was a meat, hey, how are you? 

Speaker 2  (01:10)
How are you looking at 

Speaker 1  (01:11)
About the bad thank you. Everybody really appreciate for being here with me. I'm sorry I know you misjudged, but Adam Myers, I guess yeah, you're also we talked about it in an email. 

Speaker 1  (01:23)
Sorry. 

Speaker 3  (01:25)
Oh, vessels and fern tendons. 

Speaker 1  (01:27)
Oh, okay. Okay. 

Speaker 2  (01:31)
He's actually he's also a captain. Oh, so he's got the ship experience that we need for this conversation. 

Speaker 1  (01:38)
That's fantastic, though. Again, thank you guys for being here with me. I mean, let me just introduce myself a little bit, and my name is man hookiosi. 

Speaker 1  (01:46)
I'm, doing my PhD at dalhauser university right now around. 2 years ago I was starting a project with a company that was working in digital inventory and additive manufacture. Recently, I just entered into program named laptop market is again from one of the universities in Canada, but its government-funded, and in this program they are going to help us in order to evaluate our idea. 

Speaker 1  (02:12)
Because right now, it's just a rare idea. As you know, president in my emails, we are at the customer discovery section. In order to see that how accent how acceptable this program is to be inside the market itself throughout this program, I have to talk with at least 100 people experts like you to get their ideas that my some kind of my work is okay, I have to change it. 

Speaker 1  (02:36)
How is it sort of things? So it was a little bit about my side, and can you guys introduce yourself a little bit more? I mean, I know everything from your LinkedIn, but it would be better to some kind of heard from you that would be fantastic. 

Speaker 3  (02:53)
My name is Adam Mars. I'm a vessel superintendent with Rosen maritime. And I've been a captain for 10 years, so I do have a lot of experience on ships. 

Speaker 2  (03:06)
Yeah, it eliminate a judge. I am the chief operating officer for horizon maritime. My background is safety and compliance. 

Speaker 1  (03:15)
Thank you very much. So I'm just talking about this process of procedure that is going. I do have a couple of questions just for 5 questions, not that much. 

Speaker 1  (03:24)
I'm not going to take that much of a time from you. And at the end of this conversation, we talk a little bit more about my idea, or I can say the pitch. The reason I'm not doing that in detail at the beginning is that I really don't want you guys have some kind of biased opinion or suggestion because of some kind of work. 

Speaker 1  (03:43)
I would like to know your honest feedback related to all of those questions. Is that okay? If you just go through that horror perfect? 

Speaker 1  (03:51)
Sorry. I have to read my questions from my screen. So the very first question that I do have is going to be related to spare parts we see this is the problem that we're going to solve. 

Speaker 1  (04:04)
I mean, I'm going to focus on Verizon. Maritime operates whistles in part of the harshest offshore conditions in the world when a critical part fails at C or an offshore asset. What does this some kind of response process actually? 

Speaker 1  (04:18)
Look like who is it going to do in this call? And what is the average time to resolution that would be acceptable for you? 

Speaker 3  (04:28)
But we do have a critical space list that we keep onboard of hope so we do keep a stock of critical spares there. And we designate what we feel is critical and acceptable repair, you know, is within a day, hopefully estimate priority there. But if we don't have the spare, we could end up waiting for that could be as long as could be days could be weeks before we get that spare that we need. 

Speaker 1  (05:00)
And related to these days and weeks, because it's one of my main focuses on that. How's the days and week? Can you roughly give me a number? 

Speaker 1  (05:07)
Not obviously at some point. It's confidential, but roughly a number that how much does it cost for you each day of the failure because of the part that you don't have access to. 

Speaker 3  (05:19)
Good luck depends of what it depends. What charter rate we're on, you know? So We could say anywhere from 50 to a $100000. 

Speaker 3  (05:27)
We can say it could be lost time, right? 

Speaker 1  (05:29)
Yeah, yeah, exactly complete to me. So 

Speaker 3  (05:32)
This perfect. 

Speaker 1  (05:34)
Verdict, yep makes sense. So my next question would be about the safety certifications. So I mean misled your CS B and the CEO so when a part is sourced, and especially we are talking about the nun OM or aftermarket parts. 

Speaker 1  (05:52)
What's the certification and sign of process on the safety sides? I mean, the reason that I'm asking this question is related to additive manufactured parts or rameo. You need to have in. 

Speaker 1  (06:09)
Order to consider the part as a good part 

Speaker 2  (06:13)
Insurance really doesn't come into play with this. There's two things 1, if it's oem and under warranty we. Have to go with the original equipment manufacturer recommends or you could put your warranty at risk. 

Speaker 2  (06:25)
I don't know Adam. You could probably speak more to you know when we don't have to use an oem part. 

Speaker 3  (06:31)
Yeah, so oems. I always recommend their own parts, right? So you know, we try to the most part to get the oem parts, but there are times that we do get on oem parts. 

Speaker 3  (06:44)
They don't come with a certificate per se. As they're not only it, but they are within the specs of what we need when we do World Cup. 

Speaker 1  (06:54)
Yes, make sense. So this certification is there's regulation parties that we are talking about the DN and obviously lawyer registration you talk with all those companies, right? 

Speaker 3  (07:04)
I mean, European 

Speaker 1  (07:06)
Yes, yes, it makes sense. 

Speaker 2  (07:08)
But definitely on, that's clas. 

Speaker 1  (07:10)
Yeah, exactly. I'm not talking about an oem. Yeah, because my next question is about that. 

Speaker 1  (07:15)
So today, if you need a part or a replacement part as you just mentioned some of them, they don't need to have the certifications. So obviously some of them need to have the dnv certified. So in this process of having the parts that need dnv certified section. 

Speaker 1  (07:33)
The virtually the thing is going to slow down this process. 

Speaker 2  (07:38)
It's the parts that need to be. I guess more equipment that gets inspected and not really cuts. 

Speaker 1  (07:45)
Yeah, exactly yeah. 

Speaker 3  (07:47)
Yeah, so D and V normally keeps the vessel certified to operate. So they'll monitor all our plan, maintenance. And our equipment and stuff like that, to make sure everything is snuff, whatever, but they don't normally monitor carts, they do check that we do have a critical part. 

Speaker 3  (08:04)
So emigrated and critical parts inventory onboard. But that's pretty much as far as goals, right there. 

Speaker 1  (08:12)
Okay, that makes sense. It's good to know perfect. So let's talk about the inventory. 

Speaker 1  (08:17)
I was talking about different kind of industries about the ship, about some kind of Arctic industries and anywhere. So about the ship industries, they told me that they're dealing with numbers around maybe 30 to $50 million of physical spare parts inventory, just normal, just in case does have it as a spare parts. So is it also your kind of consideration? 

Speaker 1  (08:40)
I mean, you're also going to have so much so many parts as a spare. Just in case you needed 1 day or have you considered any maybe solution in order to reduce that cost? 

Speaker 3  (08:52)
Blake says we had this. We have a critical spirit stock onboard. That's what we keep. 

Speaker 3  (08:58)
It's not 30 or $50 million nowhere near that. But we have on our vessels. We have Duplicate equipment. 

Speaker 3  (09:07)
So that's how we produce our critical spares inventory because a lot of our equipment is the same, we have 2 engines that are the same. We have 3 generators that are the same. We have 4 thrusters that are the same equipment 2 propellers, so we can have to have spirits for every piece of it we just have it for they say, one per each type of unit what we do, right, yeah. 

Speaker 2  (09:33)
So that we're done to see allows us a breathing room. 

Speaker 1  (09:38)
Make sense, make sense. Thank you. My next question would be about the obviously the main part, the additive manufacturing and digital inventory. 

Speaker 1  (09:47)
So if you were to consider replacing even one physical stick, spare part as a class approved and on demand product part. What specific risks internal approval? Wall barriers and operational condition. 

Speaker 1  (10:03)
You have to consider to say that this part or this equipment is some kind of type. We would like that. 

Speaker 3  (10:13)
But are you saying that if we get not only in parts Vs oaxab? 

Speaker 1  (10:19)
My yes, my exact, my main question is related to a part that is not for the oem yet the blueprint that you have for printing that one, for example, is additive. Manufacturing part is certified by om. Yet you are going to produce that. 

Speaker 1  (10:37)
You are going to have it on-site. By yourself. 

Speaker 2  (10:46)
So I think I'm not sure if we understand the question. So we have oem parts onboard on-site and it's to It's to the level that we feel is acceptable from a financial perspective. And from a risk perspective, and then we also have non oem parts on-site as well for the same reasons. 

Speaker 2  (11:06)
So yeah, so if we were to reduce any of those Spare compliments spare inventories. We would have to have a good reason. Why we're taking those off and we would have to do that through a risk assessment and we would have to have, for example, the only reason why I can see right now if we were going to reduce inventory. 

Speaker 2  (11:30)
Let's say we had a vessel operating in a part of the world for a long-term contract, say 1 to 2 years and we could have a warehouse on hand that could store these. Or we have an oem that has these on shelf. So if they're readily available, and they're right there where we're operating or even if we're not even operating that part of the world readily available on the shelf that reduces our risk. 

Speaker 2  (11:54)
But if there's a long lead time, that's when we run into the problems, right? 

Speaker 1  (11:59)
Yep, yeah. Yeah. I like that idea yeah, long wait time that was one of the answers I was looking for so my final questions would be about the removed access technology background. 

Speaker 1  (12:09)
So you spend the time at removed access technology as a director of safety and quality? Obviously so that name suggests technology for remotes or hard to process have hard to access environments, which is one of the reasons that we had this idea of working. And we'll talk about Arctic conditions. 

Speaker 1  (12:26)
What types of remote operation challenges? Did you encounter that they're related to equipment parts or maybe maintenance? 

Speaker 2  (12:36)
So speaking specifically to my experience, when we talk about remote access, we're really talking about a lot of it was high angle, so it was at heights. But taking it in today's context, there are parts of the world. We operate in like the Arctic, and it is not easy to get parts in those areas. 

Speaker 2  (12:57)
You know, yeah like Adam. We can even speak about the last project we're on with vessel number three and you know, we had some mechanical issues, and it was difficult to get the parts. 

Speaker 3  (13:07)
Yeah, very difficult. 

Speaker 1  (13:09)
Okay? So about. 

Speaker 2  (13:11)
Getting a person out a repair person out there. Like trying to find an airport and then it's definitely challenging. 

Speaker 1  (13:18)
Okay, excess, yeah, I like that. I mean, I like the challenges, but yeah, I like the answers. So thank you very much for all of the answers, and I'm dumping the question. 

Speaker 1  (13:28)
Just let me a little bit talk about my idea. So all of these questions had a reason for that, as I just mentioned the idea that we are working right now is building an ecosystem, the ecosystem between different kind of entities and users, the oems, the 3 year printing facilities and authoritarian and lab. Some kind of certifiers, so the reason that we are doing that is we would like to try to reduce the downturn costs help the end users in order to find a way to some kind of reduce all of the problems that I mentioned yeah, I know at this point is a little bit challenging. 

Speaker 1  (14:00)
But we're working on it, another thing that you have focused on is that we cannot talk about. Ecosystem, if we don't talk about digital inventories. So digital inventory means that you have to talk about additive manufacturing, one of the things that you had in online was encouraging different industries to have specific big part, specific amount of their physical inventory and shifted to digital inventory by using 3D printing facilities. 

Speaker 1  (14:25)
They can produce the parts that they need on-site, or if they don't want to have the 13 printing facilities, they can be connected to the near 3D printing facility, to have that, rather than that, we just consider using technology as well. Using the machine learning or AI, not only in some kind of the digital inventory side, but other side of some kind of the whole project itself. So that was about my idea, and I really would like to know that how industry I mean from your perspective, how industry is going to adopt or accept the matter of digital inventory right now. 

Speaker 1  (15:01)
I mean, the reason I'm saying that is I was talking with the navy defense and they somehow showed the interest in this idea. And I talked with a couple of different industries, yet most of them, they against that, because when we talk about the new technology, we but the new rules we have to train people. We have to have so much money so much money. 

Speaker 1  (15:23)
So it means that you have to consider all of the facts as you just mentioned risks, but in a total form in some kind of as an expert. What do you think about different industries to moving forward to having shifting from physical inventory to digital inventory? 

Speaker 2  (15:41)
Sorry. Just before you jump in there, it's a little bit like just from my perspective. Adam probably has a better perspective. 

Speaker 2  (15:47)
But for us. You gotta remember we're shipping industries. So a lot of our inventory, our components and parts and the digital inventory subs great. 

Speaker 2  (15:58)
But it sounds like you'd be adding to lead time. It would have to be made 

Speaker 1  (16:04)
To be honest, one of the reasons that we are using for the digital inventory. Yes, at some point. Maybe you can say that okay, I do have the part. 

Speaker 1  (16:12)
Why should I need to have another editive manufacturer to some kind of obviously increase the timing. The reason they were saying that is that we would like to try to reduce the inventory and we would like to shift our focus to the parts that instead of just having on-site, something would happen. And you have to ship it from another site, and you have to, for example, the Arctic section you mentioned that you didn't have the part or you have to some kind of order from another side and we are trying to reduce the downturn cost between this transportation. 

Speaker 1  (16:43)
Not the inventory, we would like to offer you a way to reduce the physical inventory and maybe focusing a little bit more on some kind of digital that's the idea that you have right now. 

Speaker 3  (16:55)
A digital inventory would be, what do you mean? Can you explain to me long-term for sure? 

Speaker 1  (17:01)
Exactly. So the idea of digital inventory is that you as the client or as the end user is going to have the 3D printing facility on-site. We are not talking about big parts right now. 

Speaker 1  (17:12)
We are talking about the noncritical or nonstructural parts right now. And then you do have this blueprint that throughout us a VR platform or some kind of a software from another oem, and it would install on your machine. Whenever you need a part, you can produce the part on-site. 

Speaker 1  (17:31)
Yes, yes, that's the whole idea of your talking. 

Speaker 2  (17:35)
So things like a bearing 

Speaker 1  (17:37)
Exactly yeah, yeah, I did not have an example or I said but yeah, something like that. Because meaning the reason I'm sorry interrupted their reason. I'm saying that is when I was talking to different industries. 

Speaker 1  (17:49)
The small parts that you don't have it on-site. For example, something costs around $500 could stop the million dollar industry. That's why we are aiming that part to have it on-site. 

Speaker 1  (18:01)
Rather than just waiting for it, maybe a couple of days to produce in just a couple of hours and you can move forward. 

Speaker 2  (18:09)
We're saying we would actually make the part on the ship. Within a 3-D printer, yes. 

Speaker 3  (18:16)
The raw materials would you use like wet materials? Would it be right that thick steel 

Speaker 1  (18:22)
Right now we try to focus in on different industries, different some kind of parts, but at this point, we focus on metal, and then we're also going to target the polymer as well. But the polymer is going to be a little bit costly right now. So metal is the thing that we focused on 

Speaker 3  (18:43)
It's interesting but I still think that there need to be approvals for also, if you were making. If you were printing a card, it has to be approved by oam. So then you'd have to have that blueprint approved, there'd be a lot of approvals required for that. 

Speaker 1  (18:55)
Definitely, I completely agree with you. And you're right, this is the beginning for us a few days ago. We had the great meeting with Lloyd registration V. 

Speaker 1  (19:03)
Some kind of proposal pitch they liked it, and obviously they mentioned the same thing you mentioned you have to talk with them because Lloyd doesn't care about how a part is going to be produced the traditional way or the am way we have to approve it. Obviously. We have to work on that. 

Speaker 1  (19:20)
And we would like to work on a recipe that without considering the fact that what machine you're using, what kind of process you're doing, you're following a receipt, and this receipt is going to have the approval behind its back, because Lloyd and dmv already precertified that go forward and your part is okay. This is the thing we consider right now. 

Speaker 2  (19:41)
I mean, in theory, it sounds wonderful. 

Speaker 1  (19:45)
In theory. 

Speaker 3  (19:46)
Sorry. So in terms of 

Speaker 2  (19:49)
Yeah, I mean, it definitely keeps costs down in some cases because we're not buying up in advance. You know, depending on the, like some of the older tonnage that we have in the Fleet. That may be a benefit or may not work in that application. 

Speaker 2  (20:06)
Because The older ships need, you know, like, in some cases, like the departments need to be specially machined. And but I mean, in theory, see no problem with it. 

Speaker 1  (20:17)
No perfect, thank you very much. 

Speaker 2  (20:22)
Right. 

Speaker 3  (20:23)
Yeah, a few amount of approvals record and that, but I think it's a pretty good idea. Just about how big would this 30 printer be? Like, how big a pair could it make 

Speaker 1  (20:34)
Yes, exactly. This is boarded for the sample of the neck. As you just mentioned, we are at the customer discovery plan. 

Speaker 1  (20:40)
We do have the company beside our. I mean, this work that I'm talking to another some kind of part of it is the industrial company. So that company is also working with 3D printers, and they do have all of the knowledge I'm at the platform. 

Speaker 1  (20:53)
And some kind of the knowledge-based site. But yeah, I completely agree with you that we have lots of approval thing. I mean, we're moving forward, especially, we are going to be a Canada based platform. 

Speaker 1  (21:04)
Because the idea that I'm saying telling you is somehow exists in Europe and also the US is also working on it. But the Canada base and especially, I believe you all following the political news about the Canadian platform. So we are trying to have the almost the first one before anyone else. 

Speaker 1  (21:23)
And that's why the reason of this kind of meetings thank you very much. Thank you very much for your time. And your opinions, you just won last favor that you have is that obviously, as I just mentioned and at the beginning, I have to talk with so many people, 100 athletes. 

Speaker 1  (21:37)
So. Finding those people, it would be so hard if it would be from my side, I'm so lucky to have you, but just in case from your perspective, if you find anyone in your connection that could be helpful for me in this customer discovery plan, I would be more than happy if we can introduce them to. 

Speaker 2  (21:53)
I might have a couple people at a shiftyards that you can talk to I can make that connection. 

Speaker 1  (21:58)
That's fantastic. Thank you very much. Really? 

Speaker 1  (22:00)
Thank you very much for the time. Thank you for so many thank you have some great day that I'm
