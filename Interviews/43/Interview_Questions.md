## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: GKN's Aerospace AM Strategy & Certification Authority 🚀

**"Matthew, can you walk me through GKN's approach to aerospace AM? Specifically: (1) What certification pathways do you use for DED parts—EASA, AS9100, internal GKN, or a combination? (2) How much of GKN's supply chain is currently enabled by AM, and what's your target in the next 3-5 years?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates GKN's certification model** — Self-certify? External? Hybrid?
- **Identifies certification authority** — Who does GKN partner with (EASA, Nadcap, DNV)?
- **Tests scale trajectory** — Is AM a niche or core to GKN's future?
- **Measures commitment** — Are they hiring/expanding because market is real?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Clear pathway**: "We work with EASA for primary structures, Nadcap for quality, and self-certify secondary components"
- ✅ **Growth trajectory**: "We're at 5% of supply chain now, targeting 20% by 2028"
- ✅ **DED strategic role**: "DED is critical for repair and near-net-shape aerostructures"
- ✅ **Investment signal**: "Bristol hiring is to support [specific platform/product] rollout"
- ✅ **Certification confidence**: "We've cracked certification for [materials/processes], now scaling to volume"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Certification is still the blocker" (indicates less progress than expected)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which certification body is the 'gatekeeper'—EASA or internal GKN standards?"
- "What's your timeline for EASA approval on new AM materials (Ti64, Inconel)?"
- "Does GKN self-certify for secondary structures, or is everything external?"
- "Are your customers (Boeing, Airbus, Rolls-Royce) asking for specific certifications?"

### Q2: Real Certification Barriers vs. Regulatory "Impossibility" ⚖️

**"I've heard from industry leaders like Shawn Sooley at Shield Group that certification isn't actually regulatory-impossible—it's more about 'fear of extra work' and risk appetite. From your experience certifying DED parts at GKN, what do you see as the REAL barriers? What would need to happen for a third party like AddManuChain to provide pre-certified AM parts that GKN could use?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates Shawn's insight** — Is certification a real technical barrier or a procedural one?
- **Tests AddManuChain feasibility** — Can a third party become trusted certifier?
- **Identifies what suppliers need** — What demonstrates credibility to GKN?
- **Maps pathway** — What's the minimum viable certification for parts supply?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Acknowledges procedural friction**: "It's not impossible—it's about proving consistency and traceability"
- ✅ **Identifies real barrier**: "The blocker is [qualified people, testing infrastructure, batch consistency], not regulations"
- ✅ **Third-party validation**: "We'd need them to [match our QA, provide full genealogy, partner with Nadcap]"
- ✅ **Pilot feasibility**: "For secondary components, we could do a pilot in 6-9 months if they're certified"
- ✅ **Supply chain appetite**: "Our customers are asking for nearshore AM suppliers"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Only major primes like Arcam can get certified" (indicates high barriers)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's GKN's biggest certification headache right now—powder quality, process repeatability, testing?"
- "If a supplier had Nadcap AS9100, would that be sufficient to qualify as a GKN supplier?"
- "How long does it take GKN to qualify a new AM supplier from first sample to production use?"
- "Would GKN pay a premium for pre-certified AM parts delivered on-demand?"

### Q3: Supply Chain & On-Demand AM Business Model 📦

**"One of the pain points I've validated with operators is excess inventory—$4-5M for utilities, $30-50M per offshore vessel. Aerospace also carries critical spares that sit unused. Has GKN explored on-demand spare parts AM to reduce inventory while maintaining availability? What would that business model look like?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Tests inventory pain** — Is aerospace/defense similar to O&G (8-10% ratio)?
- **Validates on-demand model** — Would GKN/customers accept 2-week lead time on spares?
- **Identifies barriers** — Cost? Certification? Risk tolerance?
- **Measures AddManuChain relevance** — Does platform solve a real need?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Inventory acknowledgment**: "Yes, we carry 15-20% spare inventory for critical components"
- ✅ **Model interest**: "On-demand AM for spares is interesting, but only if we maintain same lead time"
- ✅ **Cost sensitivity**: "If AM reduces inventory by 30% and costs the same, we're in"
- ✅ **Risk profile**: "For non-critical systems, we'd accept longer lead times; for flight-critical, must stay current"
- ✅ **Digital integration**: "We need full traceability—batch history, material genealogy, test results"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "On-demand doesn't work for aerospace—too risky" (indicates conservative procurement)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's GKN's typical inventory-to-asset ratio for defense/aerospace?"
- "For a spare part with 18-month supply lead time, what's the break-even on AM if you cut it to 2 weeks?"
- "Would you need parts in 48 hours, 1 week, or 2 weeks to be useful?"
- "How would you verify that on-demand AM parts meet the same quality as original equipment?"

### Q4: Aerospace Certification as Market Unlock 🔐

**"Shawn Sooley from Shield Group told me: 'Aerospace certification is hardest first—if you can certify for aerospace, oil & gas becomes easy. The credibility transfer is powerful.' From GKN's perspective, is that true? Would aerospace-certified AM parts automatically qualify for O&G, defense maritime, or other applications?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates cascading strategy** — Does aerospace certification unlock downstream markets?
- **Tests market priority** — Should AddManuChain pursue aerospace FIRST or O&G beachhead?
- **Identifies certification hierarchy** — Is aerospace actually harder than DNV/Lloyd's?
- **Measures strategic power** — Could GKN/aerospace validation become marketing lever?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Confirms cascade effect**: "Yes, if you're EASA-approved, DNV and Lloyd's practically auto-approve"
- ✅ **Aerospace credibility**: "Aerospace standards are stricter on traceability and consistency"
- ✅ **Downstream markets**: "O&G, maritime, defense all look to aerospace certifications as baseline"
- ✅ **Competitive advantage**: "An aerospace-certified supplier becomes tier-1 material in our eyes"
- ✅ **Timeline clarity**: "EASA approval takes 2+ years, but once achieved, market opens"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Aerospace and O&G are separate ecosystems—doesn't transfer" (contradicts Shawn's insight)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Are EASA and Nadcap standards tougher than DNV and Lloyd's?"
- "If AddManuChain got EASA approval for a material/process, could we use that to fast-track DNV/Lloyd's?"
- "Would GKN customers (Boeing, Airbus, Rolls-Royce) trust aerospace-certified AM suppliers for their own supply chains?"
- "Is there a specific aerospace certification body that's the 'gold standard'?"

---

### Q5: Partnership & Pilot Opportunity 🤝

**"If AddManuChain positioned itself as a supplier of aerospace-certified AM parts integrated with digital inventory (full traceability, batch history, on-demand delivery), would that solve a problem for GKN or your customers? What would a pilot look like, and what would convince you to try it?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Tests partnership receptivity** — Is GKN open to external AM suppliers?
- **Identifies pilot criteria** — Part type, material, volume, timeline, cost?
- **Measures commitment** — Would GKN fund a pilot or just observe?
- **Enables next conversation** — What's the path from interview → meeting → pilot?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Problem validation**: "Yes, we need nearshore AM suppliers. Sourcing from Canada would solve [geopolitical/cost/quality] issues"
- ✅ **Pilot definition**: "Start with [secondary component], [Ti64 or Inconel], [10-50 parts], [6-month timeline]"
- ✅ **Success criteria**: "If you hit cost, lead time, and quality targets, we'd scale to [other applications]"
- ✅ **Commercial interest**: "We'd pay a premium for certified, traceable parts"
- ✅ **Ecosystem interest**: "This could work for our customers too—Rolls-Royce, Airbus"
- ✅ **GKN stakeholder interest**: "Let me connect you with [procurement, engineering, program management]"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "GKN only works with established suppliers" (indicates closed procurement model)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What's the minimum order volume to make a pilot economically viable?"
- "Who at GKN would need to approve a supplier pilot—procurement, engineering, quality?"
- "Would GKN want to co-develop a part, or just test an existing component?"
- "What's your timeline for decision-making on new suppliers?"
- "Are there other GKN stakeholders (customers, programs, divisions) I should connect with?"
