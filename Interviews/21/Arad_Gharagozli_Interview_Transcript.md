Okay, [...12.8s] what the fuck. [...120.8s] So, yeah, [...98.9s] I don't [...0.4s] know [...0.7s] why [...173.3s] the sound. [...459.3s] Oh, [...0.5s] oh, hello, [...1.4s] hello, [...0.8s] can you hear me?

Hi, Mamota, can you hear me? Yeah yeah, yeah, I can hear. Are you, [...1.8s] how are you doing? I'm, I'm really sorry, I'm joining late. I'm driving right now. Oh oh, oh my God, I mean, we can reschedule it if you want. I mean yeah, what's it?

Yeah, yeah, how are you? I mean, we can reschedule it if you want, because I know that [...0.6s] you're, you can some kind of talk right now. Would that be okay? Or from your end, [...1.7s] sorry, say it again. I mean, we can reschedule it if you want, because when you're driving, I mean, it's not a very proper [...0.4s] situation.

Oh no, it's fine. Um, I was going to, [...0.4s] yeah, I was going to reschedule, but the thing is I'm traveling next week, so I won't be around and then it will be the week after.

Okay um, but, yeah, we were just in a different, uh, we were just in a meeting, uh huh, being a client and that's why, [...0.4s] uh, and I was kind of ran out or didn't check the time. Yeah, oh shit, I have a meeting with nuts.

Haha, no, that completely understand it because the reason that I'm offering that is in another 15 minutes. I do have some kind of [...0.4s] another meeting with another person. I'm so sorry about that, but I rescheduled for 30 minutes that if I want to start this one, it will be more than that. And I'm going to lose that one if you're traveling, because I'm not in the constraint. I mean, you can rescheduled maybe in two weeks, that is totally fine with me.

I mean, [...0.4s] tell you what, why don't we have a quick chat? Cause I know, uh, you said you have a meeting in 15th. Let's talk about it. I wanna kind of know about, like, what you're thinking, how to stop. We can do a follow up meeting in two weeks as you said, but that gives me some time to, kind of, think about what you're looking for. If you need any help from me, I can't contact.

Yeah okay, why don't we just perfect for sure? So, um I mean, the process was like this. I mean, at first I just had my question, then I talked about some kind of my idea, but since we are some kind of in brush, I would like to talk about the idea that I have right now.

So my name is Michael Keasury, as I just told you in the email, I'm doing my PhD at Dalhaus University. And around two years ago, I was working with a company 3D printing god additive manufacturing company that, uh, we entered a program named my Tax. So throughout that one, uh, recently we got accepted into another program named lap to market. So in this program, we have to talk with different peoples from different expertise [...0.4s] to see that what are they, some kind [...0.4s] of perspective about my idea itself.

So I've talked to me more than 50 people and I thought, why not try to enter the aerospace area as well? Because obviously you are experiencing that board.

So the idea of my some kind of, I can be said some kind of sounds like a pitch, but the idea of this project or at this, I can say pre startup is about building an ecosystem, the ecosystem between different entities. When you're talking about 3D printing, obviously we're talking about the end user, the clients, the Oems. We are talking about the authorities and regulator regulations and other kind of stuff. So we thought about building a platform that could some kind of ease these access that in order to help different industries to reduce the downtown cost and also about all of the money that you're spending.

So the main focus of our work was about oil and gas industry, but recently we found out why not try to some kind of talk with other industries as well? Also, in our some kind of work, we found out we cannot talk about 3D printing and additive manufacturing if you don't talk about digital inventory. So we thought about the digital inventory as well. And throughout that, we also found out why not try to some kind of put AI in machine learning in itself.

I'm, I'm still trying to figure it out. But, uh, I was talking with Reaction Dynamics, I guess, recently, and, um, also, uh yeah I mean, Mr [...0.8s] Duana, I guess, uh, some kind of introduce you as me, uh, to me in order to talk with. So that's the whole idea, that's the, some kind of the, uh, the whole pitch that I have in my mind. Still I'm thinking about it. I'm gathering knowledge [...0.4s] because throughout this program I'm in the discovery mode, I mean, try to find my actual customers.

So what is your total idea about it? I mean, is it something that maybe [...0.8s] galaxya and you thought about that before? I mean, I have you, are you using 3D printing and additive manufacturing in your work? [...1.9s]

Uh, yes. So to answer that question, yes, we do. Um, maybe I wanna kind of like get a better understanding of like what it, what is your actual business. So like in like one sentence or one paragraph, like what is the actual business you're going for?

The business is the digital inventory ecosystem that we offer a platform to people in order to encourage them to have on site printers or connect them to some kind of 3D printing facilities. So then what the main some kind of the secret sauce is a platform itself. We are not having any physical thing. It is a digital thing. So this is the whole scenario that we do have and inside that area that when you're talking about the ecosystem, we would like to help industries to talk with different ecosystem rather than focusing on physical inventory and spending so much money, try to at least have the 5 to 10% portion of their inventory to digital one. [...1.8s] This is okay.

So basically the idea is that it's a website, exactly. If I want to print something, yes, I can go on it and it will tell me where the closest printer is and I can print to it exactly. I mean, they're very small portion of that. Yes. Because, uh, when you're talking about just printing, it's not just a normal printer because you have to have your IP, you have to talk with Oems and all of these process obviously take some time because maybe the very first question that you have in your mind is that, why not? I'm trying to do it by myself or maybe some kind of contact another person that can bring it, bring it to me. So the idea that we do have right now is try to encourage people to have contact with the local 3 printer facilities or maybe have the 3D printer by themself.

Because after Covid, one thing that we understood is that the supply chain is so fragile and we cannot all the time some kind of real be dependent to China or maybe some kind of Europe or anything could happen at the end of the day. We try to reduce the some, kind of, the timing that you have, especially when you're talking about other, yeah, this, [...0.4s] yeah, I got it, so let me give you my quick feedback on it.

I think ideas really good. It's interesting, yeah um, [...0.4s] again what I'm picturing is, [...1.5s] uh, what I'm picturing is [...0.9s] that you go on this website and you can even, like, for example, [...0.6s] um, it basically like Uber Eats, kind of thing. It shows you where the [...0.4s] nearest [...0.6s] restaurants are.

Yes, and you can order food from. In this case, you're looking for all the printers around you, and then you can pick and choose, yeah, the type of printer you wanna print to, because [...0.6s] maybe I'm trying to printing glass or printing aluminum, or, [...0.6s] uh, the different filaments. So you can choose, [...0.6s] and it will prop, you can upload your, [...0.6s] uh, your, your 3D model, and it will give you a cost estimates gonna cost you this. And, and maybe some of the printers are busy, some of them are not.

Yeah, so that's the video, right, yeah yeah, yeah, [...0.6s] so I think it's a great idea. I would use it, [...4.6s] spot the printer. I'm sorry, I lost, I lost you for I would probably even, like, put our. [...1.7s] I'm sorry, [...0.7s] what was the last thing you heard? I mean, [...0.7s] after, [...0.4s] when you mentioned that it was a great idea, I lost everything, so what was that?

Okay, what I'm saying is I think it's a great idea. I would use it, [...1.7s] and what I was going to say is [...0.5s] Uber Eats was a bad example. I think it's more like an Airbnb, so I can also, [...0.4s] I was just saying, like, we just ordered, like, one of those bamboo printers. I think it's called, yeah yeah, and [...1.0s] we can also put our [...0.4s] printer on that platform exactly yes, when we are not using it to get any money from it. Yep yep yep, yep, that's another concept.

Yeah, [...0.8s] so I would say just, [...0.8s] I would say if you're pitching it, pitch it like that in my opinion, so it's like Airbnb 4.3 printer, so [...1.0s] you can either rent somewhat 3D printer, [...0.9s] or, [...0.8s] uh, if you, if you have your own 3D printer or any sort of printing capability. If you are not using it, you can put it out there for your downtimes to, to make money.

Yes, uh, from your printer. Yeah, yeah, so [...0.5s] but [...0.8s] what I'm if, if you want any feedback from the business side, I'm just wondering, like, what will be your differentiator. Uh, let's say again, the big question that everybody would ask you is, like, what stop being [...0.5s] me from [...0.4s] that same website [...0.7s] with bunch of extra things, and make it even bigger and better, and just run you out of business.

That's my only question, but I don't know if you're looking for that or not, but [...0.5s] I'm so sorry. I mean, I'm losing you constantly. I just heard that [...0.4s] what is going to different you. Uh, did you mention any website that is already doing this or [...0.6s] video? I'm gonna turn off my video, you can turn off yours too. Yeah okay okay yeah, yeah, go on [...1.0s] say what's the bad word.

Yeah, [...0.7s] so it's going to say, yeah, my only thing is on the business side. I don't know if you need any, if you're looking for feedback on that, but I'm just saying like, how would you be differentiated from other companies? Like, you don't have a strong IP on it. Uh, [...0.7s] any company can come in exactly [...0.6s] and know exactly that. Uh huh uh, [...0.8s] you're talking specifically about aerospace. Um, one big problem I can see with this is, um, a lot of, I mean, most companies are like that, but aerospace a bit more. They're very worried about IP, exactly. And it's in some cases, you're also getting into controlled goods, yes. Um, so if you're making a part, let's say, if you're printing a nozzle for a system that is controlled goods, people are not going to do that. Yeah, cause, uh, [...0.7s] they don't know who has access to it.

So [...1.1s] as a business, it might get a bit hard to [...0.4s] use a platform like that because you have no idea who has access to that printer or who can see your product. Um. For that reason, I might not use it [...0.7s] a lot of the times. Yeah. And it will end up being like a [...0.4s] kind of a pet project if you will. Does that make sense?

Uh. So the idea, yeah, I completely understand it. Uh, that is something we came of at the very, very initial part of this project [...0.5s] about the IP. Obviously they're talking with Oems, so especially in oil and gas, the Oems are so conservative and defense defensive against their or their, their IP. So this is something that we are working on it. We have to talk with different Oems, first of all, we have to find our clients, then talk about them. So I completely understand it. We're still working on it [...0.4s] about this, some kind of [...0.7s] checking the goods, the quality assurance and anything related to that.

We already in contact with the Lloyd registration. I mean, the Lloyd is one of the big names in the oil and gas working on that area. And also we are trying to talk with DMV, so we have somehow try to have our pitch for Lloyd. They like the idea, especially this is one of the kind in Canada. [...1.4s]

And about that part, you mentioned that what about someone is trying to use my some kind of printer or any other kind of related to that? The beauty of this platform is that it acts as a pipeline. And when we are talking about the pipeline, obviously we are talking about locks, [...0.4s] any action that is happening inside this platform because right now I'm working on MVP on a developer side, any action that is happening inside this platform is getting recorded. So it means that if I would like to put print apart if I don't have the IP. If I do have IP, that's another story, [...0.4s] but if I don't have the IP, I have to go through a couple of checking points.

I have to go through Oems. I have to make sure that regulations [...0.4s] are going to be agreed with me that because I would like to make sure that anything I'm going to print is going to be useful, not, I'm sorry, the trash. I'm not going to have that one obviously. So we are working also on that area and it means that everything is connected. If everything is like the chain and if someone doesn't work, if an OEM or if the regulation was it doesn't work, you cannot even print anything.

So that's the thing, somehow I can say is going to different us from other platforms. I'm not sure. But have you heard about Poly Unity? I probably heard, right? [...1.9s] Um, sorry, do I? Sorry to get your voice. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Have you heard about poli unity? [...1.7s] No. Okay. So the Paul unity is somehow they do have the same business plan and they're working in the some kind of health area. I had a meeting with [...0.4s] the cofounder [...0.4s] two days ago and he somehow like the idea because they were only working on mostly polymer and they still haven't entered the oil and gas industry. They don't have that much of idea what's going on.

So we all also going to work with them because it is very, very known name in Newfoundland. I mean not maybe in Halifax, but in Newfoundland that's some kind of the big name. So we are also in talk with them to see what would happen about the collaboration.

I mean yeah, this is a, [...0.6s] this is there something of their report that they want to, like to give it to you about that? Yeah yeah, no, I mean, that's, that's good. As I said, it's more, [...0.9s] um, I was, um, I was just kind of like, I'm sure you have thought about these things, but, yeah, that was the only thing that came to my mind on that side, [...0.4s] the ideas interesting. Yeah, and, um, [...0.6s] as I, yeah, I think it's pretty good. I, [...0.5s] and you're doing great job doing your customer discount.

Thank you, thank you very much. But just in case, because we only have three minutes, I really would like to have this some kind of conversation more, but I'm so sorry I have to talk with so many people as a schedule matters to me. So again I'm sorry.

No no, no worries at all. I know you're busy, I'm not that kind of busy, but would that be okay if you reschedule it? I mean, I probably, I just sent you another email and I really would like to have another meeting with you, yep, [...0.5s] for sure, for sure. No, I would [...0.6s] let that. Let me know how I can help for sure, for sure. When I think I'm one of the emails ICC Leah, oh, yeah yeah, yeah, I saw someone, yeah yeah yeah yeah, okay, if you could, if you want to reply back to me and [...0.4s] just add Leah to it, and she will, she will schedule us a time as you said in a couple of weeks.

I'm back, [...0.4s] I'm, I'm away next week. I'm back a week after, so if you wanna shoot for, like, Thursday next the week after which one. Yeah, yeah, that's fantastic, that's fantastic. Thank you very much, really, really appreciate it. You're most welcome, okay, obviously for a great location over here out, okay, take care, [...0.6s] bye. Also take you, have a good one, bye.
