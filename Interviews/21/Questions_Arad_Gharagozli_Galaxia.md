## Interview Questions

### Opening (2-3 minutes)

1. **As a fellow Dalhousie grad, I'm excited to connect! Can you tell me about your journey from the Dalhousie Space Systems Lab to founding Galaxia?**

2. **What's the current state of Galaxia—how many satellites have you built, and what's your production capacity?**

---

### Manufacturing & Supply Chain (10 minutes)

3. **Walk me through how you manufacture a satellite—what are the main components and manufacturing processes?**
   - *Probe:* Where does additive manufacturing fit in your production?
   - *Probe:* What percentage of parts are 3D printed vs. traditional manufacturing?

4. **For spare parts and replacement components, how do you currently manage inventory?**
   - *Probe:* Do you stock parts? Hold digital files? Order on-demand?
   - *Probe:* What's your biggest pain point in parts availability?

5. **Satellites have extremely tight tolerances and certification requirements. How do you handle quality assurance for AM parts?**
   - *Probe:* What certifications are required?
   - *Probe:* Any parts you CAN'T use AM for due to certification?

6. **What's your supply chain like—are you sourcing mostly from Canada or internationally?**
   - *Probe:* Any supply chain disruptions that have impacted production?
   - *Probe:* Interest in more localized/on-demand manufacturing?

---

### Space Industry Context (5 minutes)

7. **Harvey Doane (Interview 16) told me the space industry prioritizes Safety > Time > Cost. Does that match your experience?**
   - *Probe:* How do you balance speed-to-market with quality requirements?

8. **For defense applications specifically, how do you handle IP protection and security requirements?**
   - *Probe:* Would on-premise/local processing be important for a digital inventory solution?

9. **What's the biggest operational challenge Galaxia faces right now that technology could help solve?**

---

### Digital Inventory / AM Platform (5 minutes)

10. **I'm researching a platform that would help companies manage digital inventory—storing part files digitally and printing on-demand rather than warehousing. Would that concept be relevant for Galaxia?**
    - *Probe:* What would make it valuable?
    - *Probe:* What would be barriers to adoption?

11. **If you could wave a magic wand and solve one spare parts or manufacturing challenge, what would it be?**

---

### Local Ecosystem (3 minutes)

12. **What's it like building a space company in Nova Scotia? What's the local ecosystem like for advanced manufacturing?**
    - *Probe:* Any gaps in local capabilities?
    - *Probe:* Are there other space/aerospace companies here I should talk to?

13. **Any connection to PAL Aerospace or Maritime Launch Services?**

---

### Closing (2 minutes)

14. **What advice would you give to someone trying to sell into the space industry?**

15. **Is there anyone else in your network you'd recommend I speak with?**

16. **Would you be open to a follow-up conversation or potentially a pilot if we develop something relevant?**

## Key Hypotheses to Validate

- [ ] Space companies use AM for production (not just prototyping)
- [ ] Certification is a barrier for AM adoption in space
- [ ] Local/Nova Scotia manufacturing capability is valued
- [ ] Digital inventory concept is relevant for satellite manufacturing
- [ ] Defense applications require on-premise data processing
