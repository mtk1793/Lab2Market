### Why This Interview Matters:
Equinor is one of the most advanced companies in the world for AM digital inventory — part of the FieldNode consortium, running a multi-year digital inventory program with Siemens, and home to **Greda Aleirum** (Global AM Lead, flagged as highest-priority contact by Tyler Beatty in Interview #33). Douglas is the first direct Equinor contact in 44 interviews.

## WARM-UP

*"Douglas, thank you for your time. I'm a PhD student at Dalhousie doing customer discovery through Lab2Market at Memorial University. I've done 44 interviews so far — including with the Lloyd's Register team this morning — and Equinor keeps coming up as one of the most forward-thinking companies on digital inventory and AM. I'd love your perspective from the asset management side, where the rubber actually meets the road."*

## CORE QUESTIONS (5)

**Q1 — The Inventory Pain Reality**
> *"As a Midstream Asset Manager, you're responsible for pipelines, processing facilities, and terminals — all requiring significant spare parts inventories. What does the inventory challenge actually look like day-to-day? How much capital is tied up in physical spare parts, and what happens operationally when a critical part fails and it's not on the shelf?"*

**Follow-ups:** Lead times for critical parts? Cost of a day of midstream downtime? How do you balance holding inventory vs. risk of shutdown?

---

**Q2 — LEAN Thinking Applied to Spare Parts**
> *"You're a certified LEAN instructor, which means you've deeply studied waste elimination and just-in-time principles. Have you applied LEAN thinking to spare parts inventory at Equinor? What optimization approaches have already been tried and where have they fallen short?"*

**Follow-ups:** Biggest waste in your current spare parts process? Have you explored digital or AI-based inventory tools? Where does LEAN break down for remote or offshore midstream operations?

---

**Q3 — Equinor's AM Program: Corporate R&D or Operational Reality?**
> *"We know Equinor is one of the most advanced companies globally in digital inventory and AM — the Siemens partnership, the FieldNode consortium, Greda Aleirum as Global AM Lead. From your position as an asset manager, is this reaching the operational level? Is digital inventory something your team is actively using, or is it still at the corporate R&D stage?"*

**Follow-ups:** Have you personally been involved in any AM or digital inventory pilots? Who in Equinor would be the decision-maker for adopting a platform like AddManuChain? Do you know Greda Aleirum — can you make an introduction?

---

**Q4 — Building the Business Case**
> *"A consistent barrier we hear is the cross-budget problem: the cost of implementing digital inventory sits in one budget, but the savings appear in a different budget. As someone with deep project controls and cost management experience, how would you build the business case for digital inventory + AM at Equinor? What numbers would a CFO or VP of Operations need to see?"*

**Follow-ups:** Typical payback period Equinor requires for operational technology investments? What financial metrics matter most — working capital reduction, downtime avoidance, or OPEX reduction?

---

**Q5 — Midstream vs. Offshore: Same Problem or Different?**
> *"Most of our discovery has focused on offshore oil & gas and Arctic operations. How different is the spare parts challenge in midstream — pipelines, compressor stations, processing facilities — compared to offshore? Is it the same pain, or a fundamentally different problem?"*

**Follow-ups:** Are midstream facilities more or less remote than offshore platforms? Is the certification pressure in midstream less than offshore (PHMSA vs. Lloyd's Rules)? Any midstream-specific parts that are frequently problematic?

---

## BONUS QUESTIONS (2)

**B1 — Sovereign Resilience & Bay du Nord**
> *"With increasing geopolitical uncertainty and supply chain disruptions — COVID, tariffs, Trump — is Equinor thinking about sovereign manufacturing resilience for its Canadian operations? Bay du Nord is a $12B project 500km offshore NL. Would Equinor support a Canadian-based digital inventory platform as part of its local content commitments?"*

---

**B2 — Referrals**
> *"Two quick asks: First, within Equinor — can you connect me with Greda Aleirum (Global AM Lead) or Brad Elliott (Equinor Canada AM rep)? Second, outside Equinor — given your 20+ years across oil & gas, LNG, and midstream, who else is wrestling with this problem and would give us an honest perspective?"*
