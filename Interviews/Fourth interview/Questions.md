## Strategic Interview Questions

### 1. The "Hidden" Downtime Bottleneck

**Question:**

> "When your team identifies a critical equipment risk on one of the vessels, where does the process usually 'stall' out? Is it the technical engineering assessment, or the logistical wait for a physical replacement to arrive?"

**Why ask:** This helps you understand if the problem is information (engineering) or hardware (logistics).

### 2. The Obsolescence Headache

**Question:**

> "With a fleet of 35 vessels from different eras and legacy companies, how often do you run into 'obsolescence'—where a part you need simply isn't manufactured anymore—and how does your team solve that today?"

**Why ask:** This uncovers the pain of sourcing parts that no longer exist in a traditional catalog.

---

### 3. The "Subject Matter Expert" (SME) Burnout

**Question:**

> "You lead a team of 85 SMEs. How much of their high-level technical expertise is currently being 'wasted' on administrative supply chain tasks, like chasing vendors for specs or tracking down lost shipments?"

**Why ask:** This identifies a "human capital" problem. If his best engineers are acting as shipping clerks, he has a major efficiency leak.

### 4. The "Trust" Gap in Third-Party Sourcing

**Question:**

> "In the offshore world, everything is built on trust and certification. When you have to source a part from a new or non-OEM vendor in a remote region (like West Africa or the Middle East), what keeps you up at night regarding that part's integrity?"

**Why ask:** This gets him to define what "Quality Assurance" means to him without you suggesting a technology.

---

### 5. The Capital vs. Risk Trade-off

**Question:**

> "As a VP managing capital budgets, how do you decide which 'insurance' parts are worth keeping in a physical warehouse versus just taking the risk of a long lead time? Is there a category of parts where that decision is particularly difficult?"

**Why ask:** This reveals his "decision-making logic" for inventory. You'll learn exactly what he thinks is "too risky" to not have on hand.

## Research Context & Closing Statement

**When to share:** After asking the questions and understanding their pain points

### Project Introduction

> "I've asked these questions because my PhD research at Dalhousie focuses on **AddManuChain**, a project dedicated to building a decentralized 'Digital Warehouse' for the energy sector. We are developing an AI-driven framework that allows companies like Noble to store certified technical data for parts digitally and 'print' them locally, near the rig, only when they are needed. By understanding your hurdles with NPT, capital budgets, and technical trust, I am trying to ensure that our platform doesn't just work in a lab, but actually solves the real-world 'last-mile' logistics gap that keeps your vessels from operating at 100% efficiency."
