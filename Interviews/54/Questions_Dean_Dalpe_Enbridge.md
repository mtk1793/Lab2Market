## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

Dean has spent almost 30 years keeping critical energy infrastructure running — gas pipelines, cogeneration plants, and nuclear facilities. He now oversees field operations across North American Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) for one of Canada's largest utilities. This means:

- **Massive, geographically distributed asset base** — thousands of compressors, valves, meters, and field equipment requiring ongoing maintenance
- **Spare parts and reliability are core to his job** — the Dawn Hub alone connects 8 major pipelines and serves 10 million customers; a failed part isn't just costly, it's a grid reliability event
- **30% productivity improvement at Enbridge** — he's already proven he can drive operational optimization at scale
- **Chalk River nuclear background** — knows what "critical part, no margin for error" actually means

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

---

### Q1 — Spare parts availability and downtime risk

> *"With 29 years in power and gas, you've seen what happens when a critical part isn't available — at Chalk River, at Sarnia, and now across Enbridge's entire LDC network. In your current role overseeing field operations, what does the spare parts situation actually look like today? Are long lead times or parts availability a genuine operational risk, or is it well under control?"*

**Follow-ups:** What's the most painful category of parts to source — specialized valves, compressor components, instrumentation? Has a lead time issue ever caused you to defer maintenance or extend an outage?

---

### Q2 — Physical vs. digital inventory: how do you manage it today?

> *"Across a distribution network the size of Enbridge's — thousands of assets spread across Ontario, Ohio, and the U.S. northeast — how do you manage spare parts inventory? Is it centralized warehousing, regional depots, or something else? And is there any appetite to reduce physical stockpiles by shifting to on-demand manufacturing for certain categories of parts?"*

**Follow-ups:** Do you know offhand what Enbridge's physical spare parts inventory is worth? What percentage of parts are custom or proprietary vs. standard catalogue items?

---

### Q3 — AM and the Dawn Hub: where could on-demand printing add real value?

> *"The Dawn Hub is a massive piece of infrastructure — 8 pipeline connections, serving 10 million customers — where a failure has serious grid-level consequences. Additive manufacturing is being used in oil and gas to print replacement parts on-demand for exactly this kind of critical infrastructure, cutting lead times from months to days. Do you see AM as a realistic tool for any part of Enbridge's maintenance toolkit, or are the certification and material requirements too high a barrier right now?"*

**Follow-ups:** What certifications would a 3D-printed pipeline or compressor component need to satisfy before Enbridge could use it? Is there a category of low-criticality parts — non-structural, non-pressure-bearing — where AM could already be used without going through a full re-qualification process?

---

### Q4 — Operational governance: how do new technologies actually get adopted at Enbridge?

> *"You led operational governance at Enbridge for over six years and drove a 30% productivity improvement. That kind of result comes from changing how people work, not just deploying new tools. When it comes to something like additive manufacturing for maintenance — who in an organization like Enbridge would need to be convinced, and what would the business case need to show before it got any traction?"*

**Follow-ups:** Is the decision driven by field operations, central procurement, or engineering? What metrics matter most — uptime improvement, cost reduction, or lead time reduction?

---

### Q5 — Asset management and the end-of-life parts problem

> *"With aging infrastructure across the LDC network, you probably have equipment where the OEM no longer makes replacement parts — or where the lead time for a custom re-manufacture is six months or more. How do you handle that today, and is that problem getting more common as the fleet ages? Would a platform that digitizes the specs of those obsolete parts and connects you to qualified manufacturers — including AM facilities — solve a real problem?"*

**Follow-ups:** What's the most common workaround when a part is obsolete — reverse engineering, stockpiling before discontinuation, or extended maintenance intervals? Which is most painful?

---

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

---

### B1 — Sarnia connection: Ontario manufacturing corridor

> *"You ran the Sarnia Regional Cogeneration Facility for TransAlta — Sarnia-Lambton is one of Ontario's most concentrated industrial zones, with refinery and energy infrastructure all in one area. Are there manufacturing or supply chain resources in that corridor that you think are underutilized for companies like Enbridge — or that an AM parts network should plug into?"*

---

### B2 — Referrals into Enbridge's supply chain and asset management teams

> *"Two quick asks: First, who within Enbridge owns the spare parts strategy and supplier relationships for field equipment — is that centralized or regional? Second, is there someone on your maintenance engineering side who deals with the 'parts we can no longer get from the OEM' problem day-to-day that would give me 20 minutes?"*

## KEY HYPOTHESES TO VALIDATE

| # | Hypothesis | Question |
|---|------------|----------|
| H1 | Lead time and parts availability is a real operational risk for gas distribution LDCs | Q1 |
| H2 | Large energy utilities hold excessive physical inventory they'd prefer to reduce | Q2 |
| H3 | Non-critical AM parts can enter utilities without full re-certification | Q3 |
| H4 | Decision to adopt AM goes through central procurement + engineering, not field ops alone | Q4 |
| H5 | Obsolete parts for aging infrastructure = immediate, high-value AM use case | Q5 |

## CONTEXT TO SHARE WITH DEAN

- 53 interviews completed — including Equinor (midstream commercial), multiple oil & gas operators, Lloyd's Register, and the Canadian Navy
- One Equinor manager confirmed: *"Spare parts are 1-2% of capex but protect 98% of production value"* — leads the conversation on ROI framing
- Atlantic XL (St. John's, NL) is our anchor manufacturing partner — first Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility in the Americas
- We're focused on Canada-based production capacity to reduce the import dependency Dean's network already lives with
