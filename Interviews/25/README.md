# Interview 25: Kwadwo (Kay) Ampofo

**Contact:** Kwadwo (Kay) Ampofo  
**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/kampofo/  
**Current Position:** Manager - SAP Business Architect, Deloitte Canada (Energy, Resources & Industrials)  
**Location:** St. John's, NL  
**Interview Focus:** ERP-Integrated Digital Inventory for Mining/Energy

---

## Why This Interview Matters

Kay is **EXTREMELY RARE** - someone with BOTH:
1. **3D printing experience** (Mechanical Designer at Paradigm Hyperloop)
2. **SAP Enterprise Asset Management expertise** (SAP Certified Architect)

This combination is **exactly what we need** to validate:
- Technical feasibility of SAP/ERP integration (KR.1)
- Real-world 3D printing adoption challenges
- Mining/O&G industry requirements

---

## Strategic Value

**Hypotheses to Validate:**
- KR.1: IoT/AI Quality System Integration (his core expertise)
- H53: Predictive Maintenance API Integration
- NH.18: AI for Stock vs Print Decision
- NH.15: Safety > Time > Cost Priority Framework

**Expected Outcome:** Get specific SAP S/4HANA integration requirements and potential Deloitte partnership

**Counter-Hypothesis to Test:**
- NH.13: Mining is Poor Fit (Interview 17 validated negative, but Kay's 3D printing background might provide different perspective)

---

## Strategic Importance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

**Why This is Our Most Important Interview:**

1. **Only person with 3D printing + SAP experience** we've found
2. **Deloitte access:** Potential to reach mining/O&G clients through consulting relationship
3. **Technical credibility:** If he validates SAP integration is feasible, that's gold
4. **Bridge role:** Can translate between engineering, business, and systems
5. **Local context:** Understands St. John's offshore/mining ecosystem
