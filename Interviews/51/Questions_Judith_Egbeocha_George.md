# Interview Questions — Dr. Judith Egbeocha-George
**Interview #51 | AddManuChain | February 2026**

## OPENING (1–2 min)

*Thank her for agreeing to share questions. Brief framing:*

> "Dr. Judith, thank you so much for this. I have five focused questions based on your Shell drilling experience and your current work at Renaissance Africa Energy. These are research questions — there are no right or wrong answers, just your honest operational perspective. Please feel free to answer as much or as little as you're comfortable with. I'll follow up on anything interesting."

## CORE QUESTIONS

---

**Q1 — Spare parts reality at the rig level**

> *"In your years as Night Drilling Supervisor and Assistant Drilling Supervisor at Shell — when a critical piece of drilling equipment failed unexpectedly, what did the next 24 hours look like? Who owned the decision to source the replacement part? What's the real cost of that downtime, and how often was the delay not about the repair itself — but about waiting for the part?"*

*(Listen for: lead times, cost per day of downtime, who makes the call, emergency procurement chaos, helicopter airlifts, workarounds)*

---

**Q2 — Engineering specs vs. procurement reality**

> *"Your well design work at Shell involved specifying exact material grades, dimensional tolerances, and equipment standards. In practice, does that engineering data actually make it from the well design file to the procurement team — or is there a gap between what the engineer specifies and what actually gets ordered? Have you ever seen a part fail because the wrong spec was sourced?"*

*(Listen for: spec drift, procurement shortcuts, OEM substitutions, engineers bypassed in sourcing, tribal knowledge vs. documented specs)*

---

**Q3 — The digital inventory pitch**

> *"Here's our core concept: instead of an offshore rig carrying $30–50M in physical spare parts inventory, a drilling operator maintains a certified digital library of part files — and when a component fails, an additive manufacturing facility produces and certifies it within 48 hours. You can order a new part like ordering from Amazon, but it arrives DNV/Lloyd's certified. From your operational experience at Shell — what's your first objection? What would need to be true before you'd trust a printed metal part on a live wellsite?"*

*(Listen for: metallurgical trust, certification skepticism, OEM warranty concerns, quality consistency, who signs off liability)*

---

**Q4 — Frontier drilling context (Renaissance Africa)**

> *"You're now at Renaissance Africa Energy working in frontier drilling markets where logistics are presumably even more extreme than offshore Canada. How does parts availability shape rig operations planning in that environment? Is there a version of this problem where having a certified digital parts library becomes not just convenient — but the only viable solution?"*

*(Listen for: lead times to Africa, import/export friction, local content requirements, emergency protocols, reliance on expensive fly-in parts)*

---

**Q5 — PhD research and certification frameworks**

> *"Your doctoral work at Memorial was in Process Engineering. Did any of your research touch on materials behaviour, component qualification, or supply chain reliability in drilling environments? Is there academic work or Memorial research you'd point us toward as we build out our parts certification framework? And — given your experience — how should we be thinking about the interaction between C-NLOPB, DNV, and Lloyd's in the certification pathway for AM-produced drilling components?"*

*(Listen for: research overlap, Memorial contacts, views on C-NLOPB process, how certification actually works from the engineer's perspective)*

---

## BONUS QUESTIONS (if time allows)

**B1 — Predictive maintenance**

> *"Your Shell role in Well Performance Management suggests you were tracking equipment reliability and KPIs over time. Is predictive maintenance — anticipating a part failure before it happens — standard practice in well operations? If you knew a component was likely to fail in two weeks, would that change how you'd want to source the replacement part?"*

**B2 — Referral ask**

> *"Is there anyone in your Shell wells engineering or procurement network — or at Renaissance Africa Energy — who you think would be the right person to speak with about spare parts strategy and inventory modernization? We're looking for people who own the budget or operational frustration around this. Even a name would be incredibly helpful."*

---

## CLOSING

> *"This has been incredibly valuable, Dr. Judith. Your drilling background — especially the combination of Shell field experience and your Memorial PhD — is exactly the expertise we need to pressure-test our assumptions. Can I come back to you with a follow-up question or two as our research evolves? And if you'd be open to a 15-minute call at any point, that standing offer always holds."*
