## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

Judith is a rare triple-threat: **11+ years of Shell drilling operations experience**, a **PhD from Memorial (the epicentre of NL offshore research)**, and a current frontline leadership role at **Renaissance Africa Energy**. This maps directly onto our core customer problem.

1. **Operational insider view** — As a Night Drilling Supervisor and Assistant Drilling Supervisor at Shell, she has lived the reality of equipment failure, parts logistics, and downtime cost in remote drilling environments.
2. **Well design × materials selection** — Her Well Design role involved specifying exact equipment standards (EDM Landmark), material selection, and tolerances — the exact information needed to create a validated digital parts library for AM production.
3. **Memorial PhD** — Her 2020–2025 doctoral research at the heart of NL's offshore academic ecosystem means she deeply understands the regulatory and technical environment (C-NLOPB, DNV, Lloyd's) — and may have direct research overlap with our platform.
4. **Africa + Canada dual context** — Renaissance Africa Energy means she can speak to remote and frontier drilling operations where supply chain pain is even more acute than Canada.

**Key question to answer:** From a well engineer who has designed, supervised, and managed drilling performance at Shell scale — what does the real spare parts crisis look like at the rig level, and would a certified digital inventory platform actually change her team's behaviour?

## INTERVIEW GOALS

- [ ] Understand the ground-level reality of spare parts pain during drilling operations (lead times, stockouts, downtime)
- [ ] Validate whether equipment specs and material tolerances from well design files could feed a digital parts library
- [ ] Understand how certification and approval requirements interact with on-rig parts decisions
- [ ] Explore the frontier/remote context (Renaissance Africa) where supply chain disruption is even more severe
- [ ] Get referrals into Shell wells engineering, Renaissance Africa procurement, or Memorial's engineering research network

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

**Q1 — The spare parts crisis at the rig level:**
> *"In your years as Night Drilling Supervisor and Assistant Drilling Supervisor at Shell — when a critical piece of drilling equipment failed unexpectedly, what did the next 24 hours look like? Who owned the parts decision? What's the real cost of that downtime, and how often were you waiting on a part that should have been there?"*

**Q2 — Equipment specs and materials in well design:**
> *"Your well design work at Shell involved specifying exact equipment standards, materials, and tolerances. In your experience, does that engineering data — the material grade, dimensional specs, mechanical properties — actually make it from the well design file to the procurement team? Or is there a gap between what the engineer specifies and what actually gets ordered?"*

**Q3 — The digital inventory concept:**
> *"Here's our core hypothesis: instead of a rig carrying $30–50M in physical spare parts inventory, a drilling operator maintains a certified digital library of part designs — and when a component fails, an AM facility produces and certifies it within 48 hours. From your operational experience at Shell, what's the first thing you'd push back on? What would need to be true for you to trust a printed part on a live drilling operation?"*

**Q4 — Frontier and remote operations pain:**
> *"You're now at Renaissance Africa Energy working in African frontier drilling markets. Remote supply chain logistics are presumably even more extreme there than offshore Newfoundland. How does parts availability shape operations planning in that environment? Is there a version of this problem where digital inventory is not just convenient — it's the only viable option?"*

**Q5 — PhD research intersection:**
> *"Your doctoral research at Memorial focused on Process Engineering within the offshore context. Did any of your PhD work touch on supply chain reliability, parts qualification, or materials behaviour in drilling environments? Is there academic work or Memorial research you'd point us toward as we build out our certification framework?"*

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

**B1 — Well performance management and predictive maintenance:**
> *"Your Shell role in Well Performance Management suggests you were tracking equipment reliability and optimization data over time. Is predictive maintenance — knowing a part is likely to fail before it does — common practice in drilling? If you could predict a parts failure 2 weeks in advance, would that change how you'd want to source the replacement?"*

**B2 — Referral into Shell wells engineering network:**
> *"We've been trying to connect with the wells engineering and procurement teams at Equinor and Shell specifically around Bay du Nord. From your Shell network — who would be the right person to talk to about spare parts strategy and inventory modernisation at the well-team level? Would you be willing to make an introduction?"*

## CONTEXT TO SHARE WITH JUDITH

- **AddManuChain**: digital spare parts inventory + additive manufacturing production + certification-as-a-service for offshore, drilling, and remote industrial operations
- **Our anchor**: Atlantic XL (St. John's, NL) — first Lloyd's Register-certified AM facility in the Americas
- **Regulatory path**: We work within C-NLOPB + DNV/Lloyd's/ABS frameworks — not trying to bypass certification, trying to make it faster
- **Who we've spoken with**: Equinor, Lloyd's Register, Irving Shipbuilding, C-CORE (Mike Paulin), CME NL, Renaissance Africa leads
- **Our thesis**: 1–2% of capex in certified digital spare parts protects 98% of production
