## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

Maja is the **founder and CEO of Voltai** — a Nova Scotia-based ocean cleantech startup building hardware that goes directly onto marine vessels and offshore platforms. This interview is uniquely valuable because:

1. **Fellow ocean tech founder in Atlantic Canada** — Maja has navigated the exact same ecosystem we operate in (COVE, Ocean Startup Project, Innovacorp, Invest Nova Scotia). She understands the resources, the players, and the realities of commercializing ocean technology in this region.

2. **Hardware manufacturing for marine environments** — Voltai builds physical generators that must survive harsh marine conditions. She faces the same reliability, parts sourcing, and manufacturing scale-up challenges that our platform addresses. Her perspective on the supply chain pain of producing marine-grade hardware in Canada is directly relevant.

3. **Autonomous vessel integration** — Voltai is powering autonomous surface vehicles and collaborating with Sma'knis Marine Security and Marine Thinking on an autonomous RHIB. Autonomous/unmanned vessels are a prime use case for digital spare parts — no crew means zero tolerance for parts failure and no one on board to improvise repairs.

4. **Canadian Coast Guard & DFO relationship** — Voltai was born from an Innovative Solutions Canada Challenge sponsored by DFO and the Canadian Coast Guard. She has direct relationships with government procurement that overlap with our Navy/Coast Guard market angle.

5. **Founder-to-founder insight** — As a deep-tech CEO who has raised capital, pivoted during COVID (mask factory), relocated to Nova Scotia, and is now commercializing, Maja can offer unfiltered perspective on what it takes to build a hardware ocean tech company in Canada — including what platforms and services she wishes existed.

6. **Cross-sector technology validation** — If Voltai's marine generators could benefit from AM-produced components (high-density, custom geometry, low-volume production runs), it validates our platform for the broader ocean tech startup ecosystem, not just oil & gas majors.

## INTERVIEW GOALS

- [ ] Understand Voltai's business plan and commercialization path (target customers, revenue model, near-term milestones)
- [ ] Learn how Voltai is already using 3D printing today (what parts, materials, qualification, in-house vs. external)
- [ ] Identify where digital inventory + certification could strengthen Voltai's current workflow
- [ ] Explore how AM choices affect cost, lead time, and reliability in marine deployments
- [ ] Get founder-to-founder perspective on scaling hardware ocean tech in Atlantic Canada
- [ ] Explore referrals into the COVE ecosystem, Ocean Startup Project network, and Invest Nova Scotia contacts

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

**Q1 — Business plan and commercialization path:**
> *"Voltai has a compelling technology story. Can you walk me through the business plan at a high level — who the first paying customers are, how you price and sell, and the next 12-18 month milestones you are optimizing for?"*

**Follow-ups:** Pilot-to-commercial conversion steps? Hardware sales vs. recurring service? What is the biggest revenue risk right now?

---

**Q2 — How you are already using 3D printing:**
> *"I understand Voltai is already using 3D printers. Which parts are you printing today, and why those parts? Is printing done in-house or through partners, and what materials and qualification steps do you rely on?"*

**Follow-ups:** What is the decision rule for print vs. machine? Any reliability or certification hurdles? What failed prints taught you the most?

---

**Q3 — Manufacturing workflow and where digital inventory could help:**
> *"If I map your current workflow from design to build to deployment, where do delays or rework happen most often? If you had a digital parts library with version control, qualified designs, and a repeatable certification record, which part of your workflow would improve first?"*

**Follow-ups:** Design iteration speed? Documentation for customers? Supplier handoffs? What data do you wish you had at your fingertips?

---

**Q4 — Supply chain economics and AM trade-offs:**
> *"When you compare printed parts vs. conventional manufacturing for your components, what are the real trade-offs you see in cost, lead time, and performance? Where does AM clearly win, and where does it still lose?"*

**Follow-ups:** Which parts are most sensitive to lead time? Are you optimizing for cost, performance, or speed today? What would change your AM usage mix?

---

**Q5 — Fitting the AddManuChain pitch into Voltai's reality:**
> *"If AddManuChain offered a certified digital inventory for your parts, with trusted print partners and automated certification records, where would that fit into your business plan? Would it help you scale pilots, de-risk deployments, or open new customers?"*

**Follow-ups:** Who would need to trust the certification record (customers, insurers, regulators)? Would you pay per part, per fleet, or per project? What proof would you need before adopting it?

---

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

**B1 — The Dalhousie CEOTR connection:**
> *"You're running a pilot project with the CEOTR team at Dalhousie — that's our home university. We'd love to understand more about that partnership. What are you testing, and how has collaborating with a university research group compared to working with industry partners? Is there an opportunity for AddManuChain to connect with the CEOTR team as well — perhaps for testing AM-produced marine components in real ocean conditions?"*

---

**B2 — Referrals into the ocean tech ecosystem:**
> *"You're deeply connected in the Atlantic Canadian ocean tech world — COVE, Ocean Startup Project, Innovacorp, Invest Nova Scotia, the Coast Guard. Two asks: First, are there other ocean tech founders or hardware companies at COVE who are wrestling with parts sourcing and manufacturing challenges that we should talk to? Second, within Invest Nova Scotia or the Ocean Startup Project — is there someone who thinks about supply chain infrastructure for the ocean tech sector that you could connect us with?"*

## CONTEXT TO SHARE WITH MAJA

- AddManuChain: Canadian platform for digital spare parts inventory + AM production + certification-as-a-service
- Currently focused on offshore O&G, Canadian Navy, and Arctic remote operations
- Lloyd's Register certified Atlantic XL (St. John's) as the first AM facility in the Americas — our anchor manufacturing partner
- We've done 50+ interviews across oil & gas, defense, aerospace, marine, and regulatory
- We're exploring the ocean tech startup market as an expansion beyond oil & gas majors
- Fellow Dalhousie connection — our PhD research is at Dalhousie, and Maja's pilot is with Dalhousie CEOTR
- We believe digital manufacturing infrastructure benefits the entire ocean tech ecosystem — not just incumbents

## IMPORTANT NOTE ON FRAMING

Maja is a **fellow founder**, not an enterprise buyer. The conversation should feel like two ocean tech entrepreneurs comparing notes, not a vendor pitch. She has deep empathy for the startup journey and will respond best to authentic curiosity about her challenges.

The most valuable outcome is understanding whether the **ocean tech startup segment** has manufacturing/supply chain pain that AddManuChain could serve — and whether the ecosystem (COVE, OSP, Innovacorp) is a distribution channel we should pursue.

Come in as a peer, not a seller. Ask what keeps her up at night.
