## WHY THIS INTERVIEW MATTERS

Maja is the **founder and CEO of Voltai** — a Nova Scotia-based ocean cleantech startup building hardware that goes directly onto marine vessels and offshore platforms. This interview is uniquely valuable because:

1. **Fellow ocean tech founder in Atlantic Canada** — Maja has navigated the exact same ecosystem we operate in (COVE, Ocean Startup Project, Innovacorp, Invest Nova Scotia). She understands the resources, the players, and the realities of commercializing ocean technology in this region.

2. **Hardware manufacturing for marine environments** — Voltai builds physical generators that must survive harsh marine conditions. She faces the same reliability, parts sourcing, and manufacturing scale-up challenges that our platform addresses. Her perspective on the supply chain pain of producing marine-grade hardware in Canada is directly relevant.

3. **Autonomous vessel integration** — Voltai is powering autonomous surface vehicles and collaborating with Sma'knis Marine Security and Marine Thinking on an autonomous RHIB. Autonomous/unmanned vessels are a prime use case for digital spare parts — no crew means zero tolerance for parts failure and no one on board to improvise repairs.

4. **Canadian Coast Guard & DFO relationship** — Voltai was born from an Innovative Solutions Canada Challenge sponsored by DFO and the Canadian Coast Guard. She has direct relationships with government procurement that overlap with our Navy/Coast Guard market angle.

5. **Founder-to-founder insight** — As a deep-tech CEO who has raised capital, pivoted during COVID (mask factory), relocated to Nova Scotia, and is now commercializing, Maja can offer unfiltered perspective on what it takes to build a hardware ocean tech company in Canada — including what platforms and services she wishes existed.

6. **Cross-sector technology validation** — If Voltai's marine generators could benefit from AM-produced components (high-density, custom geometry, low-volume production runs), it validates our platform for the broader ocean tech startup ecosystem, not just oil & gas majors.

## 5 CORE QUESTIONS

**Q1 — Manufacturing supply chain for marine-grade hardware:**
> *"Voltai is building ultra-high-density generators that go directly onto vessels and offshore platforms — real hardware in a harsh marine environment. Where are you manufacturing your components today? What does your supply chain look like, and what are the biggest bottlenecks when you need a custom part — lead times, minimum order quantities, finding suppliers who can work with marine-grade specs?"*

**Follow-ups:** Are you manufacturing in Nova Scotia or still relying on Ontario? How many unique parts go into a Voltai generator? Have you ever lost development time because a part wasn't available?

---

**Q2 — Additive manufacturing for custom marine components:**
> *"Your generators are compact, high-density, and custom-designed — that sounds like a geometry and materials profile where 3D printing could be valuable. Has Voltai explored additive manufacturing for any of its components? And if a platform existed that let you store your qualified part designs digitally and print them on-demand at a certified facility like Atlantic XL in St. John's — would that change how you think about your supply chain and inventory?"*

**Follow-ups:** What materials are your key components made from? Are there parts where traditional manufacturing limits your design? Would on-demand local production reduce your time-to-iterate?

---

**Q3 — Autonomous vessels and parts reliability:**
> *"You're working with Sma'knis Marine Security and Marine Thinking on an autonomous RHIB, and your technology powers unmanned surface vehicles. When a vessel has no crew, there's nobody to improvise a repair if something fails. How do you think about parts reliability and redundancy for autonomous systems? And does the shift toward unmanned marine operations create a stronger case for having a digital parts inventory that can produce replacements fast — before the next deployment?"*

**Follow-ups:** What's the failure mode that worries you most on an unmanned vessel? How quickly do autonomous operators need replacement parts? Is there a preventive maintenance model for autonomous marine systems?

---

**Q4 — Canadian Coast Guard, DFO, and government procurement:**
> *"Voltai was born from an Innovative Solutions Canada Challenge sponsored by DFO and the Canadian Coast Guard. You've been inside the government innovation procurement process. From your experience — how receptive are these agencies to adopting Canadian-made technology? And would a 'Buy Canadian' or sovereign supply chain mandate help platforms like ours (and companies like yours) get traction with government fleets?"*

**Follow-ups:** Is the Coast Guard actively looking for Canadian suppliers for vessel components? Do you see a path where ocean tech startups collectively push for Canadian-first procurement? What was the hardest part of the ISC Challenge process?

---

**Q5 — Building an ocean tech company in Atlantic Canada — what's missing:**
> *"You relocated from Ontario to Nova Scotia specifically to be closer to the ocean and the ecosystem here — COVE, Ocean Startup Project, Innovacorp, Invest Nova Scotia. As a founder who has been through it: what's working in this ecosystem, and what's still missing? If you could wave a magic wand and have one platform, service, or piece of infrastructure that doesn't exist yet — what would it be?"*

**Follow-ups:** What resources at COVE do you use most? Is access to marine-grade manufacturing a bottleneck for startups here? Do you see other ocean tech founders struggling with the same supply chain issues?

---

## 2 BONUS QUESTIONS

**B1 — The Dalhousie CEOTR connection:**
> *"You're running a pilot project with the CEOTR team at Dalhousie — that's our home university. We'd love to understand more about that partnership. What are you testing, and how has collaborating with a university research group compared to working with industry partners? Is there an opportunity for AddManuChain to connect with the CEOTR team as well — perhaps for testing AM-produced marine components in real ocean conditions?"*

---

**B2 — Referrals into the ocean tech ecosystem:**
> *"You're deeply connected in the Atlantic Canadian ocean tech world — COVE, Ocean Startup Project, Innovacorp, Invest Nova Scotia, the Coast Guard. Two asks: First, are there other ocean tech founders or hardware companies at COVE who are wrestling with parts sourcing and manufacturing challenges that we should talk to? Second, within Invest Nova Scotia or the Ocean Startup Project — is there someone who thinks about supply chain infrastructure for the ocean tech sector that you could connect us with?"*

## KEY HYPOTHESES TO VALIDATE

| # | Hypothesis | Question |
|---|------------|----------|
| H1 | Ocean tech startups face significant parts sourcing / manufacturing pain | Q1 |
| H2 | AM is relevant for custom marine hardware (not just O&G spare parts) | Q2 |
| H3 | Autonomous vessels create stronger demand for digital spare parts | Q3 |
| H4 | Canadian government procurement favors (or could favor) Canadian-made platforms | Q4 |
| H5 | Atlantic Canada's ocean tech ecosystem lacks manufacturing infrastructure | Q5 |
| H6 | CEOTR / Dalhousie partnership could validate AM marine components | B1 |

- Currently focused on offshore O&G, Canadian Navy, and Arctic remote operations
- Lloyd's Register certified Atlantic XL (St. John's) as the first AM facility in the Americas — our anchor manufacturing partner
- We've done 50+ interviews across oil & gas, defense, aerospace, marine, and regulatory
- We're exploring the ocean tech startup market as an expansion beyond oil & gas majors
- Fellow Dalhousie connection — our PhD research is at Dalhousie, and Maja's pilot is with Dalhousie CEOTR
- We believe digital manufacturing infrastructure benefits the entire ocean tech ecosystem — not just incumbents

## IMPORTANT NOTE ON FRAMING

Maja is a **fellow founder**, not an enterprise buyer. The conversation should feel like two ocean tech entrepreneurs comparing notes, not a vendor pitch. She has deep empathy for the startup journey and will respond best to authentic curiosity about her challenges.

The most valuable outcome is understanding whether the **ocean tech startup segment** has manufacturing/supply chain pain that AddManuChain could serve — and whether the ecosystem (COVE, OSP, Innovacorp) is a distribution channel we should pursue.

Come in as a peer, not a seller. Ask what keeps her up at night.
