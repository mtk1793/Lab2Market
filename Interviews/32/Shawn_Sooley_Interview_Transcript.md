**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Up here so everything is okay. Yeah, the technical issue or

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** I need Roger.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** I wouldn't pair my sense of my success, okay perfect. So let's just jump into the painting itself. Let me just introduce myself. First of all, really thank you for being here with me. I know that your schedule is also busy. So really appreciate it. My name is Mahmoud Kiasari, I'm doing my PhD at Dalhousie University in Canada and around 2 years ago I was working with the company that they're also working in 3D printing and additive manufacturing, and they came up with an idea of building an ecosystem and working on digital inventory. So recently, I was accepted in the program named Lab2Market, and in this program, they were trying to encourage the young entrepreneurs like us in order to trim their idea by talking with people. It means that throughout this program, I had to talk with at least 100 people. Experts like you to see that what is happening with my idea? Is it going to be acceptable for the market? I have to some kind of have some changes, and so on and so forth. So that was a little bit about me, and the procedure is like this. That I do have a couple of questions for you. It won't take that much of a time, but before that, could you just introduce yourself a little bit? I mean, I know everything from your LinkedIn maybe just in case yeah.

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** Sure. So I'm the CEO of the Shield Group and the sole owner. So we have a pretty wide range of services from basic field level, skill trades, to more technical services. We do have an advanced manufacturing division. We manufacture removable insulation systems for mechanical equipment for things like pipes, exchangers, valves, those types of things we do. We are relatively progressive. I guess we try to stay ahead of the curve when we can. We were very tech-forward when we can be. It's difficult in our space to be tech-forward because there's nothing off-the-shelf. Unfortunately, everything is either too big, too small or just not fit for the application. So that's very difficult, but that's in a nutshell I guess what we are or who we are. We, you know, we have trades, skill trades, and manufacturing mainly, and you know, we're kind of diving into the world of additive. Now we looked at it once with Dalhousie. When I guess it was a little bit poor timing, I guess, and you know, the market really just wasn't ready for what we were discussing at the time, but we're kind of back on the path of additive now more out of necessity than anything. That was kind of pushed was forced into it. I did it for myself, and you know, others found out about it. And by some people, you just can't say no to.

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** But yeah, how you doing and happy doing it actually my project is trying to focus on that part. I mean, so, as I just mentioned the procedure is like this, I mean, for each interview, I do have a couple of questions for the peoples like you. And they are going to I would be so happy if you're just trying to give me an honest answer at the end of that, I would talk about my some kind of idea. The reason I'm not doing that right now is that most of the time, when I talk with people all of them are so nice or so helpful and every time I say about talking a little bit about my topic, they said that. Okay, let's just give this guy a little bit compliment. I don't need that. I really need an honest answer throughout all of the questions. Because there are so valuable for me to some kind of check. If that might kind of idea is ready for the market or not. So whatever the okay started questions.

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** Yep, and I probably have no problem with honesty back yet.

## Question 1: Operational Challenges — Spare Parts, Lead Times, Inventory

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** So Shield Group provides industrial services to offshore, oil and gas mining and manufacturing reliance in Atlantic Canada. As you just said in your experience, what are some kind of the biggest operational challenges your customer face and especially, have you heard some kind of any complaints about spare parts availability, long lead time or inventory management.

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** Yes, so we have seen quite a bit of complaints and chatter about things in that exact space. So we have a lot of people that come to us now. More so just because inherently people are creatures of opportunity and they really don't know to complain about it because they've always kind of faced those challenges. They've always had these problems. And it's just been known that that's the way the world is so they don't know that it's a problem. While they know it's a problem, they just don't know that it's a problem that can be solved. Yes, so they don't really talk about it in a way that they look for a solution per se.

But oftentimes the conversation comes up and they express that it would be great if the option was there. **But they often have to, like, they talk about it as if it's fairytale, not as if it's a real solution.** Because they just don't understand and most people see things like additive manufacturing as a toy solution not an industrial solution. Until you really start to discuss advancements in material science and the technology, when it comes to additive and application based solutions, things like that.

So it's hard to really nail down the exact complaint, but it always comes back to, you know, I drive the same information from almost everyone. **Especially in Newfoundland** and I mean, I don't know if you're asking about Newfoundland specifically or across the board. But **it's much more obvious in Newfoundland than it is anywhere else.** And it's much more impactful in Newfoundland because we have such difficult environment to reach with logistics that oftentimes the island itself is difficult, so when we're talking about the marine sector and the industrial sector whether it be offshore, the marine environment with vessels, boats, mining sector up north it becomes extremely difficult to operate.

Which I mean ultimately that creates a much larger issue, because the operation and the way things operate, the way that assets operate now. They come at an inherent cost, and that cost is not really realized. But that cost, I mean the trickle down economics of what that cost obviously, you know where that lands — that lands in your pocket. You know, when it comes to resources, energy, things like that, but **the dramatic reduction in cost that could be seen with advanced manufacturing is understood, but it's not believed yet.**

You know, everyone in the space would understand... But ultimately, the engineers of the world are not who need to answer these questions. The engineers in this situation really just the ones who will I guess highlight how the world is going to change. But you're not going to see the engineers being the ones who need the service or need the tools or the application, whatever the application may be in terms of additive manufacturing or better inventory management, because I've also spoken quite in depth, with several of my clients about inventory management and how it would look because I mean **we do it with our own products right now.** And we provide some form of inventory tracking or management just in that small portion, and it's effective and we could do that with pretty well anything.

And with the right evaluation, the right tools, we could come up with the right formulas for hey, look, what do you need? What can we utilize out of the manufacturing for? What can be local? And in-house? And how do you manage that?

Because honestly, **most of these places they don't — I think that at some point a 3D printer will be as common in most places as your copier.** Your photocopier. However, I don't think that everybody's going to want to be able to go ahead and jump in and use that. I mean, that's why the Pinnacles of the world exist, because the photocopiers someone needs to do the maintenance and things like that, it's easy enough to come in and just press the button to point and click.

But I think there's a much bigger need that needs to be addressed in the space that we're talking about here now. Like in the industrial world in the commercial world, where if someone needs to explain to someone or someone needs to manage for someone the additive side of things because it's not just "oh, my machine is down today."

Those things are easy. Spare parts, spare machines, people to fix machines. Those things are easy. I mean, you give any millwright a 40 minute tutorial on even a more advanced machine, he will figure out everything with that machine if he has any CNC background.

**But what he doesn't have is CAD experience, he doesn't have the understanding of how things work. Not from a gear to gear kind of drivetrain perspective, but more from a geometry perspective, from a material science perspective**, and all these things come together, and it's creating a niche world that ultimately that's not understood. And I think that's what the operators know.

They understand that look, I mean they've — **Exxon has a couple of 3D printers out there on the rig, right?** But they're not utilizing them close to the potential of the machines that they have let alone the more advanced equipment that they could have there. So and from what I understand they have something like a Markforged or like they might have something like that, like an Onyx, or something like that probably. But realistically, even if you got into — well, now, you just take a little step up, you buy a Bambu Mini and then you put someone whose sole job is — not "okay, well, you're an engineer or a designer" — **you are now one man parts catalog with a well-defined and managed inventory catalog.** You have the understanding of how long it's going to take us to get these parts realistically, not only what parts we can make, and what we can't make and how long it takes to make those parts, what materials do we have to have in order to make that happen.

Now our inventory management is not nearly as focused on. What do we need to print and have on the shelf? Because we don't want to wait the 3-4, maybe 10-12 hours to print it which is drastically reduced no matter what the part is anyway, but we don't want to wait that time — we had those. But that's not the issue. Okay, well, do we need the PETG sitting on the shelf here or we need Ultimaker sitting on the shelf or we need polymers sitting on the shelf or we need this is what we're using the most of.

And then it comes down to, even a lot of the engineers that I talk to which surprises me. Because I figured a lot more of the engineering world would be more interested in additive. **They don't understand** even as far as okay, well, just because you know, you look at the scale, and it's almost like they have a linear scale like, well, here are the materials, and it's from first to last from 1 to 10 of these materials. This is the least strong, and this is the most strong. But that's just simply not the way it works and they don't want to understand — it's something else on their plate, because they still have to do their job, they still have to do everything that they do now, but now they're responsible for understanding these things.

And the problem is that the guys that you speak to, they don't need to understand it day-to-day, they need to understand it enough, to understand who understands and to understand what the people that they put in place need to understand then they need to manage those people and keep up with the understanding which becomes very difficult. **Which is where the sell for a service like an additive based inventory management system, or something like that, you know, or a system surrounding additive manufacturing, I think comes into play.**

And that's based on what I'm getting from the industry.

## Discussion: Certification & Regulatory Barriers

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** The other that's fantastic. Actually completely agree with you. Because I was also talking with a couple of industries. And apparently, they do have this kind of defensive invisible barrier against this additive manufacturing. As you just mentioned part of it comes from the understanding because one of the things that I understood from talking with them is that they are not well-educated enough to see that give this additive manufacturing some potential. But I also found out another issue that you have right now, as you just mentioned ExxonMobil or other part of industries, I found that they're okay with the very things that are going, they do have everything on shelf, and if they want to produce that, they're not going to use the additive manufacturing, they're not going to order it, but one thing that I heard so many times from them was that one of the reasons they're not going to use additive manufacturing rather than everything you just mentioned is about dealing with the registers like the Lloyd, DNV and all the certifications. So, how much these kind of the reasons that just mentioned

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** **They're not going to do that. They're never going to do that. They're never going to do that. I will do that. You will do it. Someone — one of us, someone like us will do that.** They're never going to do it, someone like, I mean, I have a relationship with the industry I understand the industry. I understand intimately what the... I understand the class societies, I understand insurance. I understand...

A big communication breakdown I guess a lot of times is someone will say "well, Lloyd's will have a problem with that." But what Lloyd's really have a problem with — is that Lloyd's or is it the insurance or is it the C-NLOPB or CNOR now or is it, you know, who is it? What regulator is it? But they'll often and they won't say Lloyd's. They won't say Transport Canada. They won't say DNV. They won't say, you know, their insurance or any number of their insurances — **they won't directly say who's going to have a problem with it. Because a lot of time, it's either assumptions or trickle down information that they don't really fully understand.** And they just assumed that you also don't understand because you don't reside on a boat or you're not on an oil rig.

So they just assume that you don't understand class societies. You don't understand the way that the system works as a whole. I understand it. Before I went on my own, my last job as an employee I was working for a company called **Project Survey**, which was effectively their purpose in life, is to show up before DNV or Lloyd's go through from top to bottom. Depending on what you're doing, it might be, you know, if you're importing a boat, or if you're bringing in a vessel or a rig to Canada, you need it flagged. You go in first — or even if there's some changes or anything that needs to be DNV or Lloyd's or Transport Canada approved, we go in to make sure everything is as it's supposed to be. And then Jose from DNV shows up, you hand him a binder. He looks at it, turns around, leaves because **two weeks of our time is less than 10 hours of his.** Okay so I understand how class works. But most people don't understand that someone outside of the marine world can understand it.

**The beauty that you'll run into is that the operators will say, DNV and Lloyd's are going to have a problem with this. Phone up. I'm in service. DNV and Lloyd's will not have a problem with this.** DNV and Lloyd's have a problem with liability and is always going to be the issue, and it's not just their liability — **DNV and Lloyd's are not an insurance company. DNV and Lloyd's are not the police, they're not the regulator they're not — DNV and Lloyd's technically work for ExxonMobil, for Suncor, for Equinor, for Sinopec, whoever. They work for the oil and gas company.** Their job is to ensure that they are compliant. They will give them a certification to say that they are compliant with some form of regulation, from whoever, whether it be ISO or whoever. They want the operators to be compliant.

That creates work for the operator because the operator must be in good standing with class to ensure... Can I tick off everybody? All the boxes are checked? And everybody's happy with them. Then, the insurance companies will say "sure you're covered." That's just the way the world turns.

So, **work — generally speaking — is your biggest adversary. And not your work, someone else having feared that they're going to have to do more work.** There you are there.

## Discussion: Type Approval & Aerospace Strategy

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** So the idea of having a new technology, if you're talking about a new platform or a new technology that's going to be in between. And somehow you're going to say that okay, I do have some backup from, for example, different kind of maybe registration. You just mentioned that the Lloyd and the DNV are not going to do that, but at least we have to have some safety approval?

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** So type approval. So type approval is going to happen progressively through the class societies in the marine and oil and gas world in the industrial world. So by trade, I'm heating frost insulator by trade, scaffolder. By trade, I have several skill trades. I'm a scaffolder. I'm an insulator, rope access technician, heavy equipment operator. I've worked with a lot of people over the course of time, the best advice that I've ever gotten from anybody was an old journeyman from Ontario when I was apprenticing said: **"Kid look, wherever you are, the best thing to do is work your way out of a hard spot on the hardest spot and work your way out. That's the easiest way to do it. Because you're going to get tired and it's gonna get a lot easier as you move away from the hard stuff."** Simple as that.

In this particular case, if you're talking about regulatory bodies, **the most difficult regulatory body you will ever face is going to be aerospace.** No question. Aerospace also has the most appetite, but they're the most difficult to work through. I'm currently working through now with **Provincial Aerospace** and I've got an order coming from Provincial Aerospace to start manufacturing materials for them. That's not additive. That goes well, then they wanna start looking at additive.

And I mean, I check a lot of boxes for Provincial Aerospace, they receive a lot of ITBs. The drivers here are you have to know what the drivers are in the industry, and it's a pretty tangled web if you don't know or you haven't been immersed in it, and I don't know if you're familiar with things like the **ITB Program — the Industrial Technological Benefits.** Things like this are why people do things — people don't just do things for the sake of doing them. They don't just give people opportunity for the sake of giving them opportunity. They choose the best people based on what sustainer needs. And it's not always the best product, it's oftentimes **who carries the most benefit all the way around.**

So given I have the mindset of — **Provincial Aerospace is fine to work with me on the aerospace front.** The EIC group as a whole, the greater EIC group to give me a chance to manufacture something so that I can demonstrate that. Okay, he understands the assignment here. He knows what is expected from the regulator. Okay, now let's look at how can we break into gray areas where things are a little bit, you know, misunderstood or things can be a little harder to interpret, like in the additive space.

So the only material that currently that the aerospace industry really wants to accept — I don't mean the regulator, I mean nobody wants to talk to you in the aerospace world — **if you say that you can't print in PEEK.** And I mean, there's a million options outside because when you're talking composites, you can have custom-made composite material. That would primarily be UK. There are materials out there now that are popping up that are better than PEEK. Stronger, very high temperature resistant, **would pass the vertical burn tests** that are the worst or the hardest to achieve out of all the physical tests that need to be achieved. But thanks to industry, they're dead set on it. And unless you can say that you print PEEK, that's not really your criteria you need to meet. That's just how they're going to talk to you.

And I think that's the golden goose. **You break through to the aerospace world and you approach Exxon and say, hey, listen I want to do this thing. They say, okay, well, the regulator's going to be there. Don't worry about it. We already do aerospace work, a ton of it. You really think your rules are going to be more stringent than aerospace? No, certainly not.** So then the conversation opens up because **the invisible barrier of "Lloyd's is going to get in my way and cause a nightmare for me on how to get anywhere with this, it's a waste of my time" — that goes away.** It's gone.

## Discussion: The Idea — AI, Digital Inventory, Ecosystem

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Interesting, okay. I mean, I was going to add more questions, but apparently you just covered all of them. That's fantastic. So let me just talk a little bit about my idea right now. So, as I believe you just guessed from my question. So the idea that we have right now is about building an ecosystem, an ecosystem between different kind of entities between the end user, the 3D printing facilities, some kind of the authorities and regulations and just kind of stuff. So this was the idea that we have. Obviously a little bit broad and a little bit ambitious. Right now after that, we moved to this part: that's okay when we are talking about these entities. We cannot leave without the fact that we need the digital inventory. Obviously when you're talking about digital inventory, we are talking about additive manufacturing, that was the glue of all of these ecosystems. Then, recently I got some kind of informed by a couple of industries that why not try to use the AI? So use the AI not only in some kind of part of the inventory, it doesn't matter, it's physical or digital, but you also can use it for something they called as predictive maintenance. So this is the total idea that you have. Tried to work on an ecosystem, working on digital inventory and obviously try to use technology as an AI. So as an expert, when we're talking about that one, so what do you think about this whole idea, or do we think I have to narrow it down to the very, very small niche, talk with only maybe oil and gas industry, or maybe another part? So what is your total idea about that?

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** **That's not new. We've been using things like Tan Delta machines to and elder equipment to utilize predictive maintenance for years.** You know, again, at Project Survey, we were the representative for Tan Delta in Newfoundland and predictive maintenance was kind of cutting edge — and we didn't use the terms AI, we just said machine learning. And we said things like algorithms, but those were just buzzwords to explain that, look, this operates in a way that I don't understand but it works and it gathers information, it cross references the information, and it gives you predictability, and it works very well.

And here are the past cases. If you get into the underbelly of the oil and gas from predictive maintenance has been around for years. And it's been utilized for years. What you're doing now is, if you go in with a predictive maintenance model, you're going to see a lot of people kind of... because I mean, you go online and you punch in predictive maintenance, you're going to get off-the-shelf software all over the place.

But what you'll find is that if you start using words like predictive maintenance and you start positioning it as an AI tool. **You're preaching to folks who've already tried and will know what works now and know what doesn't work now.** And are not — like when you say AI, I mean anyone in the industry who's not directly tangled up in research or in implementation of AI, they think ChatGPT.

And honestly, **I think you're going to have a really hard sell with selling AI. You need to give a solution.** You can use AI and it's almost expected now that people use AI, but just from my perspective, my opinion, **I wouldn't try to sell AI.** It's not a good sell, yeah, but in saying that it's not a bad idea to say, "oh of course we utilize AI because that's the most efficient way to do things," but I wouldn't make that my selling point.

**What I would make my selling point is that I understand a struggle. Or I understand a gap in the market. I understand a problem that can be solved. And you have the solution.** Sure, maybe you utilize AI or AI has made it possible for you to do that. But don't sell the AI because predictive maintenance has been around for quite some time.

AI has been quite novel — is a nice novelty and all those obvious industry applications, but I would be very careful as to try to push that because **AI changes so fast that people are afraid to buy things that are AI driven for 2 reasons.**

**One**, because it's novel, it's a novelty, and they feel that you don't actually have to put in a substantial amount of work, and you're giving a solution that has been created by AI. That ultimately, the value equilibrium is now off. Because years ago you would have had to put in substantial work to provide that particular type of a solution, and you're still trying to charge close to what you would have otherwise charged for extensive work.

**Two**, the changes in AI happen so fast. Everyone wants to — they see something, and if AI is attached in a big way or the driver is AI, **what you'll find is that people look at it and say, "well, AI, well, maybe I'll wait to see what happens in another month."** And then in another month, something happens. And they say, "maybe I'll wait to see what happens in another month." **They'll never take a solution that's AI driven,** because the solution is going to be replaced in their mind with another solution very shortly, and it's going to be cheaper or someone else is going to figure out your idea and change it just a little bit, and they're going to cut the legs out from underneath you by 20%. Just to get the business and they'll wait for that. And they've been operating for so long. Why would they go with it now? They could hold out another couple of months, because things — it's not like it takes 10 years to change, it takes 10 days.

## Discussion: Industry Credibility & Partnership

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** So what do you think about focusing on building an ecosystem and try to encourage people to shifting on digital inventory rather than the physical inventory, not fully obviously but at least part of it. My partner is a company in Ottawa, so we just try to work on this idea. And he's also working with the company in US that they also produce the 3D printers.

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** **Get yourself someone from the industry.** Okay, the only way to gain credibility — I've had this conversation. I've spoken to several people in the additive space over the last little while about working together on some things. And I've said this a million times...

I went to **Atlantic XL**, for example. They're pushing very hard for parts that have been forgotten. They haven't been able to gain traction. They go to people with things they try to engage and the traction just hasn't been gained.

I went out and I bought a $499 Bambu A1 Mini to make gadgets for my garage. And the people that Atlantic XL were going to try to gain some traction with, **came to me with a toy** and said, "hey, I need you to make me some things." And I'm like, I mean, **like industrial parts**, not things that I should be making with an A1 Mini. I started buying machines that could handle at least ASA, some stronger material.

**But it's because I already solved the problems. I solved the problems on a regular basis without this. This is not a service. This is just a tool and a tool belt.** If you don't have a problem solver from the space you will have trouble gaining traction. **Because your credibility's not been established. And in order to establish credibility, you have to be background.**

So **my advice is attach yourself to someone that's in whatever your biggest target industry is and ideally someone who is attached to multiple of the sectors.**

---

## Closing — Open Door for Follow-Up

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** For sure, for sure. That was a really fantastic conversation. So would that be okay, maybe in a couple of months in the future and shooting an email say that hey, I found something interesting, can we have another conversation about that, and maybe I can use much more of your knowledge related to that idea. Do I have that permission?

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** **You have an open book** coming said. I mean I've had additive kind of jammed down my throat, whether I want to do it or not at this point. And it wasn't that I didn't want to do it. I kind of gave up on it when it died on the branch with Dalhousie. I had no intentions of going down the path of additive again. But I mean there's stuff like, I mean, I just finished making a stem for this valve the other day. You know I've got, you know, food processing facilities come to me and say, "hey, listen, we need 20 of these things. Can you make it? And maybe can you make it better than what the other thing was?"

And I mean, I've got a bug with this stuff like it just never ends, like these are the people that I'm working with now. And this is — "Geez you do a really good job at doing what you do with this thing. **Can you do it with that thing?**" And I've been learning a lot about what people want and need.

And **there's no way that I could keep up if I did all of the work for all of the clients that I currently work for with my other services.** There's no possible way to keep up. It's absolutely not possible.

But I do have, I mean, **I have a model already established for effectively, what you were talking about doing.** I mean, I have no problems sharing and what I've found so far. And with you or whoever's also in this space, because I mean, there's a lot more to it than just — you can't just use inventory management in a standalone system. **And you need to kind of hybridize a little.**

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Yeah, for sure. Okay perfect.

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** And resources made of it. Yeah, so you ever need anything...

**Speaker 1 (Michael):** Okay, appreciate it for sure. Fantastic. Thank you very much. Really appreciate your part of time. Have a great day.

**Speaker 2 (Shawn):** Take care.
