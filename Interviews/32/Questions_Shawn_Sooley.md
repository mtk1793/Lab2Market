## MAIN QUESTIONS (5)

### Q1: Industrial Services Customer Pain Points 🏗️
**"Shield Group provides industrial services to offshore oil & gas, mining, and manufacturing clients in Atlantic Canada. In your experience, what are the biggest operational challenges your customers face? And specifically, have you heard complaints about spare parts availability, long lead times, or inventory management?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Validates customer pain point**: Do offshore operators actually struggle with spare parts?
- **Tests market demand**: Is this a real problem or just our hypothesis?
- **Identifies target customers**: Which industries/companies have the worst pain?

#### What We're Listening For
- ✅ **Spare parts pain**: "Our offshore clients constantly complain about parts taking 6-12 weeks to arrive"
- ✅ **Downtime costs**: "When a platform goes down, they lose $100K+ per day"
- ✅ **Inventory burden**: "Some clients keep $10M+ in spare parts inventory just in case"
- ✅ **Emergency requests**: "We get asked all the time if we can help source parts faster"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "Spare parts aren't really a problem for our clients" (no market)

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "Which customers have the worst spare parts challenges? Offshore O&G? Mining?"
- "Do your clients ever ask Shield to help source or deliver spare parts?"
- "What's the most expensive emergency parts delivery you've heard about?"

- "If there was a service that could deliver certified parts in 48 hours, would your clients pay for it?"

### Q2: Service Delivery Model & Partnership Potential 🤝
**"Shield provides specialized services like scaffolding and industrial access to offshore platforms. Could you see additive manufacturing fitting into Shield's service portfolio—for example, offering on-demand spare parts manufacturing as a value-add service to your existing customers? Or would that be outside Shield's core focus?"**

#### Why This Matters
- **Tests partnership model**: Could Shield be our go-to-market partner?

- ✅ **Revenue opportunity**: "If there's a business case, we'd be interested in exploring it"
- ✅ **Customer demand**: "Our clients would definitely pay for faster parts delivery"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "That's outside our core business" or "We're not interested in new services"

#### Follow-Up Probes
- "What would make this attractive to Shield? A revenue share? A referral fee?"
- "Would you want to white-label the service, or co-brand it?"
- "Which of your customers would be the best fit for a pilot program?"
- "How does Shield typically evaluate new service offerings?"

- ✅ **Distributor limitations**: "Distributors don't stock low-volume parts"
- ✅ **No good solution**: "There's no one-stop-shop for emergency spare parts"
- ❌ **Red flag**: "The current system works fine" (no differentiation opportunity)
