**Status:** Questions Ready | Awaiting Interview

---

## Quick Overview

**Interviewee:** Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi, PhD
**Titles:**
- Professor, University of New Brunswick
- Director of Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence (MAMCE)
- Canada Research Chair in Marine Additive Manufacturing
**Location:** Fredericton, New Brunswick
**Experience:** 10+ years in marine/defence AM research
**Education:** PhD Mechanical & Materials Engineering (Western University, 2010)
**Strategic Value:** Leading materials scientist + Navy gatekeeper + MAMCE authority

---

## Why Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi is CRITICAL

1. **Materials Certification Expert**: Leads the only dedicated centre of excellence for marine AM in Canada
2. **Navy Connection**: Direct relationship with Canadian Navy adoption decisions
3. **MAMCE Authority**: Controls validation and testing for Navy-certified AM suppliers
4. **Research-to-Market Bridge**: Can help commercialize AddManuChain as enabling platform
5. **Competitive Advantage**: Being validated by MAMCE could be differentiator vs. other platforms
6. **Critical Timing**: Feb 18 Admiral visit may have reignited Navy interest

## What We're Testing

### Primary Hypothesis
**"MAMCE has the technical expertise to certify AM materials for Navy use, but the barrier is Navy leadership risk appetite. A digital platform showing certified suppliers + traceability could help unlock Navy adoption."**

### Key Questions
1. **Where is Navy adoption actually blocked?** (Technical or governance?)
2. **Is MAMCE validating AM suppliers currently?** (How many? What's the process?)
3. **Would MAMCE partnership strengthen AddManuChain credibility?** (Could they be "validation authority"?)
4. **What does the Feb 18 Admiral visit mean for MAMCE's momentum?** (Real catalyst or routine visit?)
5. **Is MAMCE ready to commercialize beyond research?** (Platform partnership appetite?)

## Aaron Plamondon's Intelligence (Interview #34)

**Critical Quote from Aaron:**
> *"Mohsen was really, from what I can figure out, a leader in his field — really the guy trying to say, 'I am trying to make the powders and test the powders that will be something that the Navy would certify — something that Lloyd's would say, Yes, this batch of this material is exactly what we need.'"*

**Key Context:**
- Aaron hasn't talked to Mohsen in over a year
- MAMCE had "all kinds of ideas but never materialized"
- Navy hasn't approved AM components yet (blocker: leadership decision, not technology)
- Feb 18: Aaron + Fleet Admiral visiting Dalhousie AM capabilities — **could reignite momentum**

## Interview Prep Checklist

- [ ] Research MAMCE's current partnerships (Irving, Navy, Lloyd's Register)
- [ ] Review UNB's Canada Research Chair program and MAMCE publications
- [ ] Prepare to reference Aaron Plamondon's assessment and Feb 18 visit context
- [ ] Understand Lloyd's Register requirements (from Trevor Butler interview #40)
- [ ] Have ready: Use case for how digital platform enables MAMCE's certification authority
- [ ] Prepare "partnership model" proposal (validation authority, supplier badge, research commercialization)

## Success Looks Like...

✅ **Best case:** Mohsen validates Navy adoption timeline, expresses partnership interest, offers to be "validation authority" on platform, confirms Feb 18 visit momentum

😐 **Good case:** Mohsen acknowledges partnership potential, provides technical insights, offers to stay connected as Navy situation develops

❌ **Poor case:** Mohsen focused on pure research, unwilling to commercialize, protective of MAMCE's processes

## Key Talking Points for the Call

**Opening frame:**
"Dr. Aaron Plamondon at Irving Shipbuilding mentioned your work leading MAMCE and developing powder certifications for Navy use. He spoke very highly of your expertise. I'm building a digital platform that could help certified AM suppliers like those you validate reach the Navy faster."

**Core ask:**
"Would MAMCE be interested in serving as the validation authority on a platform—essentially offering an 'MAMCE-certified supplier' badge that adds credibility for Navy procurement?"

**Why this matters to MAMCE:**
- Scales MAMCE's validation work beyond academia
- Creates revenue stream from expertise
- Accelerates commercialization of research
- Positions MAMCE as industry authority, not just academic centre
- Helps get certified materials into Navy service faster

## Critical Timing Context

| Date | Event | Relevance to Interview |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| **Feb 18, 2026** | Aaron + Fleet Admiral visit Dalhousie AM lab | May include MAMCE discussion; potential Navy inflection point |
| **~Feb 25, 2026** | Aaron provides update on Admiral's response | Should inform follow-up questions for Mohsen |
| **This interview** | Ask if Mohsen was involved in Feb 18; what came from it | Measures whether Navy momentum is real |

## Relationship to Other Interviews

**Direct Connections:**
- **Interview #34 (Aaron Plamondon - Irving)**: Aaron referred Mohsen; confirmed MAMCE focus on Navy certification
- **Interview #40 (Trevor Butler - Lloyd's Register)**: Trevor represents the certification authority; Mohsen handles materials side
- **Interview #39 (David Haire - CME NL)**: David mentioned PolyUnity and AM adoption; Mohsen validates the materials behind any AM supplier

**Ecosystem Position:**
- Mohsen = Materials Certification Authority (UNB/MAMCE)
- Aaron = Navy Procurement & ITB (Irving Shipbuilding)
- Trevor = Classification Society Standards (Lloyd's Register)
- Together they control the pathway to Navy AM adoption

## Strategic Importance

🔴 **CRITICAL PRIORITY** — This interview determines:
1. Whether Navy AM adoption is truly imminent (Feb 18 visitor's genuine inflection point)
2. Whether MAMCE could become strategic partner/validation authority
3. What material standards suppliers must meet for platform
4. Timeline for commercializing AM components in Navy service
5. Competitive differentiation opportunity (MAMCE-certified badge)
