### Connection Through Aaron Plamondon

**Important Context from Aaron's Interview (Feb 13, 2026):**

Aaron Plamondon spoke about Dr. Mohammadi:

> *"Mohsen was really, from what I can figure out, a leader in his field — really the guy trying to say, 'I am trying to make the powders and test the powders that will be something that the Navy would certify — something that Lloyd's would say, Yes, this batch of this material is exactly what we need.'"*

> *"He was always pushing for new and better powder to use, but I haven't talked to him in over a year. We've kind of lost touch."*

**Aaron also shared critical intelligence:**
- MAMCE had "all kinds of ideas but none materialized because we could never get the Navy to say 'go try this'"
- The Navy AM adoption is entirely blocked by a leadership decision that hasn't been made
- **Feb 18 visit:** Aaron & Fleet Admiral are visiting Dalhousie to evaluate AM capabilities — could reignite Navy interest

### Interview Approach

- **Frame as opportunity:** "Aaron mentioned you're leading materials certification work. I'm building a platform to connect AM providers with end users — your certification work is critical to that"
- **Show knowledge:** Reference Aaron's insight about the Navy barrier, Feb 18 visit
- **Focus on enablement:** "How can a digital platform help MAMCE's research reach the Navy faster?"
- **Test partnership:** "Would MAMCE be interested in validating certified AM suppliers on a platform?"
- **Understand pain:** "What's blocking Navy adoption of your certified materials?"

### Critical Success Factor

Dr. Mohammadi can provide:
1. **Materials science validation** — Which AM powders/processes are Navy-certifiable
2. **Testing infrastructure insights** — What MAMCE can test, what gaps exist
3. **Navy relationship intelligence** — Why the Admiral hasn't said "yes" yet
4. **Certification pathway** — How to accelerate Lloyd's Register approval
5. **Partnership opportunity** — Could MAMCE validate suppliers on the platform?
