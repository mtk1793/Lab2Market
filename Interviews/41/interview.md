I can consider this as one of the best interviews that I had so far. 
I'm going to give you the essense of the work and at some point I maybe miss pronounced some of the wordings he said and you fix it. 

In 2016 he was the one who talked about the adoption of AM in marine. He talked wiht irving in an innovation meeting. AM was on its growing time on 2014 and 2015 and 2016 in different sectors. On that time time new methods were in Canada like Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) were installed in different companies. The goal was to FORD and second tier companies to use additive manufacturing to reduce the time of the production and to reduce the cost of the production. his background was in automotive that is why he was talking about the adoption of AM in marine and oil and gas. however the difference and big one is about the quantity was about the fact tht in automotive the number of parts were in millions while in marine we are talking about max of 2000 or 5000 ones. 

Based on this he was talking to the shipbuilding and the budget of 111 bn over 30 years in Canada. He also talked with DND and DRDC and Lockheed Martin Corporation
(NYSE: LMT) is a global aerospace, defense, and security company headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, specializing in advanced technology systems for defense and civil customers. Formed in 1995, it is a leading manufacturer of the F-35 fighter jet, missiles, helicopters, and space system. 
He metnioned we had 4 parts of work that we need to adopt.
First the company that we give the project to like irving ship building. Other company for mentioning could be named Equinor. They are the doers or buyers. They can buy the products from smaller companies like small medium enterprise which are the second stage of adopters. The third stage of adopters can be named as defence companies like Thales or Babcock or Lockheed Martin Corporation. The final stage is the federal government. The way that these guys would look at adoption is different than each other. Search about them a little. 


The BAE is considered as one of the main companies in the UK that is using AM in design section. 

He also mentioned tese companies 'The most prominent manufacturers and fabricators of oil and gas parts in this region include:

    ADJ Industries Inc. (London, ON): Specializes in custom fabrication, welding, and machining of components for the oil and gas industry, including drivetrain solutions, hydraulic fracturing pumps, and large, close-tolerance parts.
    Kel-Gor Limited (Sarnia, ON): A major industrial contractor and fabricator specializing in ASME pressure vessels, piping, and structural steel for oil and gas projects, including high-pressure and high-temperature equipment.
    Southwestern Manufacturing Inc. (Southwestern Ontario): A key manufacturer providing steel fabrication of parts and structures designed to withstand harsh oil and gas environments.
    Rushton Gas and Oil Equipment Ltd. (Southwestern Ontario): Fabricates custom skid packages, pressure vessels, tanks, and pressure piping for the energy and chemical processing industry.
    Norwest Precision Ltd. (Southwestern Ontario): Manufactures parts for drilling, processing, and fracturing equipment, including mud pump frames, crankshafts, and BOPs (blowout preventers).
    Tigercat Industries (Brantford/Kitchener, ON): Manufactures severe-duty industrial carriers used in the oil and gas sector, with drivetrain components produced in Kitchener. 

Key Industry Context:

    Sarnia-Lambton: Acts as a major hub for this manufacturing due to the presence of large refineries (Shell, Imperial Oil, Suncor).
    Dawn Hub: Located in Southern Ontario, this is a major natural gas storage and trading hub managed by Enbridge, with supporting infrastructure built by local firms.
    Historical Roots: The area, particularly Oil Springs and Petrolia, has a 100+ year history of oil production, leading to a long-established specialized manufacturing base. ' that the technology is for their side of work that could produce the parts. 

    LR bodies lik Germany include major technical inspection associations (TÜV) like TÜV Nord and TÜV Rheinland and DNV and Lloyd's Register
Another concept he mentioned related to the certification of the parts was about NDT and the quality of the parts. NDT used to use some way like 2D or Xreadyfraction. These are 2d ways. AM suffers from this fact taht these methods are not precise. If we want to show the procedure precise we have to use the micro CT scanning. The problem is the data that we get from the micro CT and the timing that we can get the data from it. At the qualifcation process we need to test one material maybe more than 1000 times to see how it is repeatible for our work. He also mentioned about the issue we have about the process of the qualification of the parts related to different machines that we have during different timing (search a little bit more about this part and tell me why?). These are the challenges for the certifications. In the dental implant from 2008 2010 they used cobalt chrome implant to certify them He also talked about the EOS M290 that 1000 watt laser can be installed on that. He also talked about M280 and M270. The poweder also can come from diffefent parts. He mentioned FDA of certification. It certified the process and the usage of M270 and related ot this matter of using the poweder from a specific company that is ceritfied by FDA. So it dpends on the machine, the poweder and the process, and QC. 

At the ned of the day, the focus is over sth called FATing. FAT is a process where the company that is using the parts is testing the parts to see if they are working as expected. In various cycles like corrosion and fatigue testing. He showed me a SN diagram related to his work. He mentioned that they compared a comparsion for the material when they printed it in 3 different directions. The horiznetla dimention won the better outcome. They are testing it to 10 to the power of 6 cycles. AM probelm is that it has procity inherently this causes that failure happens in a short time. In different industry if we would like to use AM parts we have to shift our focus over fatting section. At the end of the day final reason for AM is that it is faster than the traditional way of making parts. Yet its challenges related to quality makes it hard to make it acceptable for its comparison with conventional parts. If we do some after processing works like HIP. It increases the qulity but it costly and time consuming. Navy and CAF cant be convinced to use AM parts and its the biggest challenge now. He also mentioned that while AI and ML are good yet it is not very acceptable by the majority while the education is not that much in detail and people mostly put their focus over the traditional ways. He had some papers over the usage of AI in AM. There is a long distance between using AI and using AM. We still have a long way becuase of missconnection between different technological sides of AM technology itself and the person who uses traditional way. It mostly cultural issue. They are against some how technology and new platfroms to adopt the AI in AM. Maybe they can use these key words to get some funds from the governemnt to use AI in AM. He also mentioned about his aid to NDpower and hydro quebec that maybe I need to talk with them in the future as well. Another challenge he menthioned about my project was the idea of ownership that he mnetioned about the process of the work. Like when the CAD file you got from the OEM then you have to give it to an industry like shipbuilding irving and then when we have out platfrom that we have to make harmony among all of them to make sure the final product is flawless. a legal discussion should happen with these entities as well. Another important issue he mentioned was about the cybersecurity part which is very very important the OEMs are so insecured about the bluprint. Also its important that to make sure about the sustianability. In these 3 levels we have challenges.
