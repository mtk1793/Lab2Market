# Follow-Up Email — Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi
## Interview #41 | UNB Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence (MAMCE)

**To:** Dr. Mohsen Mohammadi
**Subject:** Thank You — AddManuChain Platform + MAMCE Partnership Idea

---

Dr. Mohammadi,

Thank you for one of the most technically rich conversations I've had in this entire discovery process. Your work on materials certification for marine and naval AM is exactly the kind of groundwork that AddManuChain is trying to build on top of — and the clarity you gave me on FAT testing, micro-CT challenges, and the MMPDS-equivalent gap was invaluable.

A few things you said that stuck with me:

**On the certification wall:**
Your description of the qualification process — machine-specific, powder-specific, process-specific, requiring 1,000+ test cycles — made something clear that I hadn't fully appreciated before: the problem isn't that certification is impossible, it's that it's been done one-off by everyone, separately, every time. That redundancy is the market. AddManuChain's job is to do it once and make it available to everyone.

**On the Navy:**
The FAT results inconsistency you described — where AM parts show inferior fatigue performance vs. conventional in critical applications — is the specific wall between where we are and where we need to be. I'd like to understand whether MAMCE's current research agenda is aimed at closing that gap, and whether a platform that tracks and aggregates FAT data across multiple facilities could accelerate the Navy's decision-making.

**On AI + AM:**
Your framing of the cultural gap — that AI in AM is technically feasible but organizationally premature — validated something we've been wrestling with. We're not leading with AI. We're leading with certified parts. The AI layer comes second, after trust is established.

**The Partnership Idea I Keep Coming Back To:**

You mentioned that MAMCE validates suppliers, certifies materials, and has direct relationships with the Canadian Navy and DND. AddManuChain is building a platform where certified suppliers are discoverable, traceable, and procurable.

What if MAMCE became the **validation authority** on the platform — an "MAMCE-Certified" badge that suppliers could earn through your process and display to operators, procurement teams, and the Navy? This would:
- Scale MAMCE's certification work beyond academic papers and into commercial procurement
- Give AddManuChain credibility no other platform can replicate
- Create a data trail of certified parts that gives the Navy what it's always lacked: a defensible record of AM part performance

I'd love to explore this in a second conversation at your convenience.

**A Specific Ask:**

You mentioned NDpower and Hydro-Québec as organizations you've worked with on AM adoption. Would you be open to connecting me with your contacts there? Both fit our utility/energy sector expansion, and coming through you would open a door that a cold email never could.

Thank you again for your time and for the depth you brought to this conversation. It was one of the best I've had in 41 interviews — and that's saying something given the quality of people I've been speaking with.

I'll follow up in a week or two, but please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind.

## NOTES FOR SENDER (remove before sending)

**Key points this email covers:**
1. ✅ References the FAT + certification wall (shows you understood the technical content)
2. ✅ References AI + AM cultural gap (his specific framing)
3. ✅ Proposes the MAMCE-Certified badge / validation authority model
4. ✅ Asks for intros to NDpower + Hydro-Québec
5. ✅ Opens the door for a second conversation

**Context on the MAMCE partnership pitch:**
- MAMCE = the only dedicated marine AM certification centre of excellence in Canada
- Dr. Mohammadi holds the Canada Research Chair in Marine AM
- He has direct pipeline to Canadian Navy adoption decisions
- Aaron Plamondon (#34, Irving Shipbuilding) referred Dr. Mohammadi as the key materials certification voice
- The "MAMCE-Certified" badge would be the most credible validator available in Canada — more recognized than any commercial platform could build independently
