awesome—here are three ready-to-record scripts about your Mitacs project (AddManuChain) in the three classic structures. Each one is written for ~60–90 seconds, first-person, with beat labels and on-screen prompts so you can record clean takes.

# 3-Act Structure

**Title card (On-screen):** “AddManuChain — fixing downtime with AI + 3D printing”

**Act I — Setup (0:00–0:20)**
“Hi, I’m Mahmoud from Dalhousie. In our Mitacs project, we kept hearing the same story from remote industries—offshore rigs, shipyards, mining sites. A tiny part fails, the line stops, and everyone waits days or weeks for a replacement. That’s expensive, risky, and avoidable.”

*(On-screen B-roll: frozen conveyor, idle crew, email ‘lead time: 14 days’)*

**Act II — Confrontation (0:20–1:00)**
“So we built **AddManuChain**: a digital inventory plus distributed 3D-printing network.
I open the dashboard, pick a certified blueprint, and route it to the nearest trained printer operator.
The platform manages everything: printer health, materials, and job queues; it also checks **quality assurance**—are the people certified, is the device calibrated, is the material approved? Then **quality control**—in-process monitoring and post-print tests with a clear pass/fail trail.
If stock is low, our supply-chain view flags risk and suggests alternatives. Even billing and compliance are one click—because auditing matters in oil, gas, and marine.”

*(On-screen: “Printers ✓ | Materials ✓ | QA/Certs ✓ | QC/Tests ✓ | Audit trail ✓”)*

**Act III — Resolution (1:00–1:20)**
“The result? Parts made **on site, on demand**, with traceable quality. Downtime drops, safety improves, and teams keep working. That’s AddManuChain—turning days of waiting into hours of producing.”

**CTA (1:20–1:30)**
“If you want to pilot this at your facility, let’s talk. I’m Mahmoud, and this is our Mitacs journey.”

# Disney/Pixar “Story Spine”

**Title card:** “Once Upon a Time in the North Atlantic…”

**Once upon a time…**
“Once upon a time, remote operators ran great machines in harsh places.”

**Every day…**
“Every day, a small failure could stall everything while a replacement part crawled through the supply chain.”

**Until one day…**
“Until one day, our Mitacs team asked: what if parts were **digital**—and printed where they’re needed?”

**Because of that…**
“Because of that, we built AddManuChain, a platform that stores certified blueprints, routes jobs to trained operators, and keeps printers healthy.”

**Because of that…**
“Because of that, quality wasn’t a guess: operators, materials, and devices are all certified, and every print has a QC report you can show an auditor.”

**Because of that…**
“Because of that, purchasing and planning got smarter—stock levels, lead times, and risks appear before things break.”

**Until finally…**
“Until finally, when a pump housing cracked offshore, they didn’t wait two weeks—they printed a certified replacement overnight.”

**And ever since then…**
“And ever since then, downtime fell, safety rose, and digital inventory became standard. I’m Mahmoud, and that’s how our Mitacs project turned ‘waiting’ into ‘working.’”

# Hero’s Journey

**Title card:** “The Call to Adventure: Ending Downtime”

**1. Ordinary World (0:00–0:10)**
“I was juggling research and industry calls. Same pain everywhere: a 10-dollar part could stop a million-dollar process.”

**2. Call to Adventure (0:10–0:18)**
“A partner said, ‘Can you make parts appear where we are, not where the warehouse is?’”

**3. Refusal / Doubt (0:18–0:25)**
“I hesitated—regulations, certifications, safety. 3D printing in oil and gas isn’t a casual hack.”

**4. Mentor & Allies (0:25–0:35)**
“With my supervisor and our Mitacs partners, we mapped the path: **digital inventory + certified production**.”

**5. Crossing the Threshold (0:35–0:45)**
“We built the first prototype—printers connected, materials tracked, and a certification gate for people, devices, and materials.”

**6. Tests, Allies, Enemies (0:45–1:00)**
“Printers failed mid-job, materials ran out, audits demanded evidence. We added live printer health, supply-chain alerts, QA workflows, and QC reports with full traceability.”

**7. Approach to the Inmost Cave (1:00–1:10)**
“Then came the real test: a time-critical part offshore, strict compliance, zero room for error.”

**8. Ordeal (1:10–1:20)**
“We ran the job through AddManuChain—trained operator, certified device, approved material, in-process monitoring, post-print inspection. Every step logged.”

**9. Reward (1:20–1:28)**
“The part passed. The line restarted the same shift. Downtime cost—slashed.”

**10. The Road Back (1:28–1:35)**
“We templated the workflow so others could repeat it safely.”

**11. Resurrection (1:35–1:45)**
“AddManuChain wasn’t just a print button—it became a **trust platform**: QA, QC, supply chain, planning, and billing in one place.”

**12. Return with the Elixir (1:45–1:55)**
“Now we offer pilots for remote sites, First Nations micro-manufacturing, and shipyards. The elixir is simple: **parts when and where you need them—with proof they’re safe**.”

**Outro (1:55–2:00)**
“I’m Mahmoud. That’s our Mitacs journey—bringing reliability to the edge of the map.”
