# CME Procurements in NL

This folder collects scripts and insights related to government procurement processes in Newfoundland & Labrador, particularly as they apply to members of CME and local manufacturers.

## Insights

- **Estimated value drives procurement rigor**: The value of the commodity being procured determines the level of process required: open call for bids, limited call, preferred approach, standard approach, or low‑dollar acquisition.  Higher value equals more rigorous evaluation.  (Source: procurement briefing transcript)
- **Transparency & questions**: Suppliers must read solicitation documents carefully, ask questions early if evaluation or requirements are unclear, and can even request rectification of minor errors.  Mercs Q&A system provides a mechanism for clarifications.
- **Digital inventory & predictive maintenance**: There is interest in linking IoT data to spare‑parts pre‑positioning, but implementation remains aspirational; suppliers should monitor opportunities in this space.
- **OEM specification issues**: Suppliers should challenge unnecessarily restrictive specifications during the solicitation period; procurement staff can amend requirements when justified.
- **Toast/feedback on Mercs**: The Mercs platform is free for NL suppliers, supports registration notifications, and has drag‑and‑drop submission; training sessions and on‑demand materials are forthcoming.
- **Procurement training & collaboration**: Government plans to offer small‑group supplier development sessions; CME and allied organizations can partner to share these resources.
- **Thresholds & trade agreements**: Procurement thresholds align with lowest applicable trade‑agreement thresholds (e.g. CFTA) and are reviewed annually; the provincial supplier allowance applies below those thresholds.
- **Rectification process**: New legislation allows suppliers a chance to correct minor submission errors post‑deadline to avoid disqualification.
- **Relationship with federal procurement**: The province coordinates with federal government on procurement policy, including the new Buy Canadian policy and infrastructure projects.

## Next Steps

1. **Compile procurement scripts**: Collect existing PowerShell/Python scripts used by CME members into this folder for easy access and version control.  (No scripts were provided in the request; add as they are developed.)
2. **Document estimated value guidance**: Create a concise reference slide or note explaining how estimated value is calculated (all forms of remuneration, premiums, fees, commissions, interest, delivery over contract years) and why it matters for procurement obligations.
3. **Develop procurement training materials**: Work with PPA to formalize the planned on‑demand materials and supplier workshop schedule.  Offer CME to co‑host sessions.
4. **Monitor Mercs & notify members**: Encourage CME members to register on Mercs; send periodic reminders about new solicitations and Q&A best practices.
5. **Engage on specification review**: Establish a process within CME for members to flag restrictive specs and coordinate responses to public bodies via PPA.
6. **Track threshold changes**: Keep an eye on annual CFTA updates and adjust internal guidance accordingly; communicate any new thresholds to members.
7. **Follow Buy Canadian developments**: Watch for the federal roadmap and assess implications for NL suppliers, especially in defence, critical minerals, and infrastructure.
8. **Capture and share insights**: Continue recording notes from procurement‑related events and add them to this repository for collective learning.
