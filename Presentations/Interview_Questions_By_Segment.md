## 📊 What to Track After Each Interview

For EVERY interview, record:

1. **Pain Intensity** (1-10): How strongly do they feel the problem?
2. **Problem (Verbatim)**: Use THEIR exact words
3. **Current Solution**: What they do today (even if manual)
4. **Emotional Language**: Did they use words like "nightmare," "terrified," "frustrating"?
5. **Frequency**: How often does this problem occur?
6. **Budget Signals**: Did they mention existing spend or willingness to pay?
7. **Referrals**: Who else should you talk to?

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. **Don't pitch your solution** - Even if they ask, redirect: "I'm still in learning mode. Tell me more about how you handle this today."
2. **Don't lead them to your solution** - Avoid: "Would you pay for a platform that..." 
3. **Don't ask hypotheticals too early** - Focus on their actual experiences first
4. **Don't mention other segments** - Each interview should feel unique to their world

---

## ✅ Interview Success Metrics

**Good interview signs:**
- They use emotional language unprompted
- They quantify the problem ("We waste $X" or "It takes Y weeks")
- They ask when you'll have a solution (shows real pain)
- They offer to introduce you to others
- They go over the scheduled time (engaged)

**Red flags:**
- Vague answers ("It's not that bad")
- Can't quantify impact
- Haven't tried to solve it before (low motivation)
- Immediately ask about your solution (not feeling real pain)

---

## 🎁 Closing Questions (Last 2 Minutes)

Ask EVERY interviewee:

1. "Who else should I talk to who has similar challenges?" (Get 2-3 referrals)
2. "Would you be open to a follow-up conversation in a few weeks once I've learned more?"
3. "Is there anything I didn't ask that I should have?"

---

**Remember**: The best interviews are where you talk 20% and they talk 80%. Your job is to listen and learn, not to convince or pitch.
