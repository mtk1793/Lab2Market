⚠️  NDA RESTRICTION CHALLENGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Labs cannot share detailed process information
due to confidentiality agreements with clients.

Impact: Customer discovery in Segment 3
        requires adjusted approach (focus on
        general workflow, not specific projects)
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS TO ADDRESS

### Gap #1: All Pricing Untested 🔴

```
REVENUE STREAM HYPOTHESES: 0% Validation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

H33: 10-15% commission from facilities      ❓
H34: $5K-$25K subscription from clients     ❓
H35: $10K-$50K subscription from labs       ❓
H36: $50K-$150K enterprise from OEMs        ❓

ACTION REQUIRED: Test with next 15 interviews!
```

### Gap #2: Channel Strategy Unknown

```
HOW DO CUSTOMERS FIND SOLUTIONS?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

H37: Conferences (RAPID, Formnext)          ❓
H38: Thought leadership (LinkedIn)          ❓

ACTION REQUIRED: Ask "How did you find your
current suppliers?" in every interview
```

### Gap #3: Lab Segment Underrepresented

```
SEGMENT COVERAGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CS.1 (Clients):       N=1, Validation=83%  ✅
CS.2 (Facilities):    N=1, Validation=80%  ✅
CS.4 (OEMs):          N=1, Validation=50%  🟡
CS.3 (Labs):          N=2, Validation=33%  ⚠️

ACTION REQUIRED: Interview 5+ lab managers
(adjust approach for NDA restrictions)
```

## 🎯 NEXT WEEK PRIORITIES

### Riskiest Assumption to Test:

```
PRICING VALIDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Question: Will manufacturers pay $10K-$25K/year
          for speed + quality matching?

Test:     Interview 15 procurement managers
          Show 3-tier pricing mockup
          Ask: "Is $15K/year reasonable given
               time savings from 3-4 weeks to <1 week?"

Success:  ≥8/15 (53%) say "reasonable"

Timeline: 2 weeks (by Feb 10, 2026)
```

### Interview Targets:

- **10 Procurement Managers** → Test pricing (CS.1)
- **3 Facility Owners** → Test commission (CS.2)
- **2 Lab Quality Managers** → Test lab subscription (CS.3)

### Outreach Target:

**200+ new contacts** (to achieve 15 interviews at 5-10% conversion)

## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### The "Meta-Discovery" from Week 3:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                     │
│  "Communication speed is THE meta-challenge"        │
│                                                     │
│  Not a feature. Not a nice-to-have.                 │
│  It's the CORE VALUE PROPOSITION.                   │
│                                                     │
│  Platform should be:                                │
│  "Communication Platform First,                     │
│   Marketplace Second"                               │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Evidence Strength:

- ✅ Mentioned in 100% of segments (5/5)
- ✅ Consistent across different industries
- ✅ Quoted verbatim by interviewees
- ✅ Higher priority than cost optimization
- ✅ Applies to BOTH internal & external communication

### Competitive Implication:

```
DON'T COMPETE ON:           COMPETE ON:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Largest supplier DB       • Fastest communication
• Lowest price             • Best-fit matching
• Most features            • Highest transparency
• Geographic coverage      • Real-time status
```

## 📋 ACTION ITEMS FOR WEEK 4

### Must Do:

1. ✅ Interview 15 people (10 clients, 3 facilities, 2 labs)
2. ✅ Test pricing with ALL 15 (add to script)
3. ✅ Create pricing mockup artifact (3-tier comparison)
4. ✅ Update value prop messaging (communication-first)
5. ✅ Request referrals from 5 scheduled interviews

### Should Do:

6. ⭐ Build simple communication prototype (mockup or Figma)
7. ⭐ Document decision process patterns (who approves purchases?)
8. ⭐ Map competitive alternatives (what do they use today?)

### Nice to Have:

9. 🔹 Create certification body decision tree (if H44 validates)
10. 🔹 Develop forecasting tool concept (if H40 strong)

## 🤔 OPEN QUESTIONS FOR TEAM/MENTOR

1. **On Communication Feature:** Should we partner with existing tools (Slack, Teams) or build our own messaging infrastructure?

2. **On Market Maturity:** If OEMs already doing distributed manufacturing, does this validate PMF faster or indicate entrenched competition?

3. **On NDA Challenge:** How do we get deeper lab insights when NDAs restrict detailed sharing?

4. **On Pricing Sequence:** Test manufacturer subscription first, then facility commission? Or parallel?
