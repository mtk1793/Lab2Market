## 🔥 RISKIEST ASSUMPTIONS (Priority Order)

### 1. PRICING MODEL (Critical Risk - Zero Validation)

```
ALL REVENUE STREAMS UNTESTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

H33: Will facilities pay 10-15% commission?      ❓
H34: Will clients pay $5K-$25K subscription?     ❓
H35: Will labs pay $10K-$50K subscription?       ❓
H36: Will OEMs pay $50K-$150K enterprise?        ❓

IF WRONG → Business model collapses
TEST NEXT: 15 interviews with pricing mockup
```

### 2. CHANNEL STRATEGY (High Risk - Zero Validation)

```
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION UNTESTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

H37: Do conferences drive qualified leads?       ❓
H38: Does thought leadership generate inbound?   ❓

IF WRONG → Can't reach customers efficiently

Platform Positioning:       →  "Real-time collaboration
"Marketplace for suppliers"     platform for distributed
                                manufacturing"
