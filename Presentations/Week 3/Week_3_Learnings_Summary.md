## 🎯 PART 1: THE LAB2MARKET PRIME DIRECTIVE

### The Fundamental Mission

> **"Your job is to validate that a problem/need exists, understand who has it, and only then, determine how best to solve it. You are not trying to educate your customers; you are trying to learn from them."**

This is not just a slogan—it represents a complete inversion of traditional product development thinking.

### Breaking Down the Prime Directive

**1. Validate the Problem First**
- **NOT:** "We have this cool 3D printing marketplace technology"
- **YES:** "Do manufacturers actually struggle to find certified suppliers?"

**The Implication:**
We must resist the urge to jump to solutions. The "problem" is our starting hypothesis, and it must be proven before we invest in building anything.

**2. Understand WHO Has the Problem**
- **NOT:** "Everyone needs faster 3D printing"
- **YES:** "Aerospace procurement managers ordering monthly need certified suppliers within 500 miles"

**The Implication:**
Specificity is critical. "Manufacturers" is too broad. We need to segment by:
- Industry (Aerospace vs. Medical vs. Automotive)
- Company size (Startups vs. Mid-size vs. Enterprise)
- Order frequency (One-off vs. Monthly vs. On-demand)
- Geographic constraints (Local vs. Regional vs. Global)

**3. Determine Solution LAST**
- **NOT:** Building features we think are cool
- **YES:** Building what customers have validated they need

**The Implication:**
Features come from validated customer pain, not internal brainstorming sessions.

### The "Learning, Not Teaching" Principle

**What This Means in Practice:**

❌ **Teaching Mode (Wrong):**
"Our platform uses AI to match you with suppliers in real-time. Don't you think that would be valuable?"

✅ **Learning Mode (Correct):**
"Walk me through the last time you needed to find a 3D printing supplier. What was the hardest part?"

**The Difference:**
- Teaching = Confirmation bias (leading the witness)
- Learning = Discovery (generating unbiased evidence)

<a name="interview-formula"></a>
## 🗣️ PART 2: THE INTERVIEW FORMULA (DETAILED BREAKDOWN)

### The 4-Part Structure

#### **Part 1: The Welcome (2-3 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Set expectations and build rapport

**Script Example:**
> "Thank you for taking the time. I'm working on understanding how manufacturers find and work with 3D printing suppliers, and I'm looking for insights and advice from experts like you. This isn't a sales call—I'm genuinely trying to understand the challenges in this space. I'll be taking notes, and this should take about 30-40 minutes. Does that work for you?"

**Key Elements:**
- Thank them (respects their time)
- Explain your purpose (transparency)
- Emphasize "advice" not "interview" (flattering, non-threatening)
- Explicitly state "not selling" (removes guard)
- Set time expectations (shows respect)
- Ask permission (builds trust)

---

#### **Part 2: Positioning Your Customer (10-15 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Understand their context and build credibility as a listener

**Question Progression:**

1. **Company Context:**
   - "Tell me about your company—what do you make/do?"
   - "How large is your team/operation?"
   - "Who are your primary customers?"

2. **Role Context:**
   - "What's your role? What does a typical day look like?"
   - "What are you responsible for?"
   - "What does success look like in your position?"

3. **Process Context:**
   - "Walk me through your current process for [relevant activity]"
   - "Who else is involved in that process?"
   - "How has that process evolved over time?"

**Why This Matters:**
- You learn their specific constraints (budget authority, technical knowledge, decision-making power)
- You identify if they're an end user, buyer, or decision-maker (different segments!)
- You build rapport before asking harder questions
- You gather context that makes their pain points more interpretable

**Pro Tip from Curriculum:**
> "Ask for insights and advice, not specifically an 'interview'"

People love giving advice. It positions them as the expert and you as the humble learner. This dynamic encourages them to share more.

---

#### **Part 3: Rank the Problem (15-20 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Determine if the problem is "hair on fire" or just "nice to have"

**The Problem Ranking Scale:**

| Ranking | Description | Customer Behavior | Our Response |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Don't Want/Need** | This isn't a problem for them | No current workaround; doesn't care | ❌ Wrong segment—move on |
| **Nice to Have** | Minor annoyance; not urgent | Has workaround; hasn't sought solution | 🟡 Secondary market—deprioritize |
| **Need to Have** | Significant pain; actively seeking solution | Has tried solutions; budgets allocated | ✅ Target market—dig deeper! |

**Questions to Determine Ranking:**

**For "Need to Have" Validation:**
- "How much time do you spend dealing with [problem] per week/month?"
- "What's the cost (time, money, opportunity) of this problem?"
- "What solutions have you tried? Why didn't they work?"
- "If this problem went away tomorrow, what would change for you?"
- "Do you have budget allocated to solve this?"

**Red Flags (Indicates "Nice to Have" only):**
- "I haven't really thought about it much"
- "It's annoying but we manage"
- "We've always done it this way"
- "I don't know if we'd pay to fix it"

**Green Flags (Indicates "Need to Have"):**
- "It's killing us" / "We're bleeding money"
- "I've tried 3 different solutions already"
- "This is my top priority to fix"
- "We've budgeted $X for this"

**The Power of "Why":**

Don't accept surface answers. Dig deeper.

**Example:**
- Q: "Why is finding suppliers difficult?"
- A: "It takes too long."
- Q: "Why does that matter?"
- A: "Because our customers need parts fast."
- Q: "Why is fast delivery important to your customers?"
- A: "Because they're in aerospace with strict deadlines. If they miss them, they lose contracts worth millions."

Now you understand the *root* problem: Aerospace customers with contract deadlines need reliable, fast suppliers to avoid million-dollar losses.

---

#### **Part 4: The Hook (5 minutes)**

**Purpose:** Enable future follow-up and generate referrals

**The Two-Question Close:**

**Question 1: Permission to Follow-Up**
> "This has been incredibly helpful. As we develop this further, would it be okay if I followed up with you to share what we're learning and get your feedback?"

**Why This Works:**
- Low commitment (just permission, not a meeting)
- Reciprocal (you're offering to share insights with them)
- Keeps the door open

**Question 2: Referrals (THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION)**
> "Who else do you think I should talk to about this? Is there someone in [adjacent role/industry] who might have a different perspective?"

**Why This Works:**
- "Warm" intro is 10x more likely to convert than cold outreach
- Shows respect for their network
- Often reveals segments you hadn't considered

**Penultimate Question Technique:**
Before you ask for referrals, always ask:
> "Is there anything else you'd like to add that I haven't asked about?"

This often surfaces the MOST valuable insights—things they wanted to say but you didn't know to ask.

## 🏗️ PART 3: LEAN STARTUP METHODOLOGY

### The Three Components

The Lean Startup is a **risk reduction methodology** with three interconnected parts:

```
Business Model (Hypotheses)
         ↓
Customer Discovery (Testing)
         ↓
Agile Engineering (Building)
         ↓
Back to Business Model (Iteration)
```

#### **1. Business Model**
A framework of core assumptions and hypotheses about how your startup creates, delivers, and captures value.

**Key Insight:**
It's not a business *plan* (static, detailed, often wrong). It's a business *model* (dynamic, testable, designed to evolve).

#### **2. Customer Discovery**
A systematic way to test core assumptions through real conversations with real customers.

**Key Insight:**
The goal is to *invalidate* hypotheses as quickly as possible. Failed hypotheses are *successes* because they prevent wasted engineering time.

#### **3. Agile Engineering**
Iterative product development based on validated learning, not feature speculation.

**Key Insight:**
Build MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) to test, not "final" products. Speed of iteration > Perfection.

### From Guess to Validated Fact

**The Product-Market Fit Journey:**

```
Start Here:
Everything is a GUESS
(Our hypotheses)
         ↓
    TEST HERE
(Customer interviews validate or invalidate)
         ↓
    ITERATE
(Update business model based on evidence)
         ↓
  Product-Market Fit
(Validated hypotheses become your business)
```

**The Curriculum Visual Shows:**
9 boxes labeled "Guess" with arrows pointing to a central "Test" box. This illustrates that we must test EVERY assumption.

**Critical Learning:**
Most startups fail because they skip testing and go straight from "Guess" to "Build." They create something nobody wants.

## 🗺️ PART 4: BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS - DEEP DIVE

### Why Visualize the Business Model?

The curriculum provides four compelling reasons:

#### **1. Clarity & Comprehension**
**Problem:** Business relationships are complex webs of dependencies.

**Solution:** Visual models simplify these relationships, making them easier to understand and remember for all stakeholders (team, investors, partners).

**Example for Our Platform:**
Instead of writing "We connect buyers with suppliers through a matching algorithm that prioritizes certified local facilities," we SHOW:
- Customer Segment (Buyers) → Value Prop (Fast, Certified Matching) → Channels (Platform) → Customer Relationship (Self-Service)
- This one line on the canvas reveals the entire value flow.

#### **2. Collaboration**
**Problem:** Different team members have different perspectives and assumptions.

**Solution:** A shared visual canvas encourages team brainstorming, ensuring diverse perspectives are considered in strategy development.

**Example:**
- Developer: "We need ML for matching"
- Sales: "We need fast customer support"
- Finance: "We need subscription revenue"

On the canvas, you can SEE if these are aligned or conflicting.

#### **3. Gap Identification**
**Problem:** Missing elements or misalignments are hard to spot in prose.

**Solution:** Visualization highlights missing elements, allowing for early detection before implementation.

**Example:**
If you have a "Value Prop" but no "Revenue Stream," the canvas makes this gap OBVIOUS. You're creating value but not capturing it—not sustainable!

#### **4. Agility**
**Problem:** Business strategies need to adapt quickly to market feedback.

**Solution:** Quickly iterate and adapt business strategies by visually mapping changes and their impacts across the model.

**Example:**
If customer discovery reveals buyers won't pay a subscription BUT suppliers will pay commission, you can:
1. Erase "Subscription from Buyers" in Revenue Stream
2. Add "Commission from Suppliers" in Revenue Stream
3. See how this impacts Key Partners (need more suppliers) and Channels (recruit suppliers first)

All in 5 minutes on a whiteboard.

### The 9 Building Blocks Explained

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Key         │ Key         │   Value     │  Customer   │  Customer   │
│ Partners    │ Activities  │ Proposition │Relationships│  Segments   │
│             │             │             │             │             │
│             ├─────────────┤             ├─────────────┤             │
│             │ Key         │             │  Channels   │             │
│             │ Resources   │             │             │             │
├─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┤
│           Cost Structure          │        Revenue Streams           │
└───────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Three Lenses:**
- **Desirability** (Right side): Customer Segments, Value Prop, Channels, Relationships → *Do customers want this?*
- **Feasibility** (Left side): Key Partners, Activities, Resources → *Can we build/deliver this?*
- **Viability** (Bottom): Costs, Revenue → *Can we make money doing this?*

**Critical Insight:**
All three must work together. A great product (Desirability) that's impossible to deliver profitably (Feasibility + Viability) is not a business.

---

### Common BMC Mistakes (From Curriculum)

#### **Mistake #1: Overly Complex Canvases**
**Problem:** Too many elements too early create confusion.

**Example:**
Listing 10 different customer segments, 8 revenue streams, and 15 key activities on Day 1.

**Prevention:**
Start simple and prioritize critical assumptions. Focus on 1-2 segments, test them, THEN expand.

**For Our Platform:**
Start with ONE segment (e.g., "Aerospace procurement managers with monthly 3D printing needs") and validate before adding Medical, Automotive, etc.

#### **Mistake #2: Neglecting Customer Validation**
**Problem:** Skipping customer discovery wastes resources.

**Example:**
Building features customers didn't ask for because "we think they'll love it."

**Prevention:**
Run iterative tests and gather continuous stakeholder feedback. Every major assumption needs 20+ customer validations.

#### **Mistake #3: Ignoring Market Dynamics**
**Problem:** Failing to learn and adapt risks obsolescence.

**Example:**
Not noticing a competitor launched a similar platform, or a regulatory change made your value prop illegal.

**Prevention:**
Monitor trends and adjust strategies regularly. This is where the "Business Environment" analysis comes in.

#### **Mistake #4: Lack of Collaboration**
**Problem:** Working in isolation hides blind spots.

**Example:**
The founder fills out the BMC alone, assumes they understand everything, and never gets team input.

**Prevention:**
Foster team collaboration and open communication. Run BMC workshops where everyone contributes.

## 🌍 PART 5: BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS

The curriculum introduces a framework that extends BEYOND the BMC to analyze **external forces** that will impact your business. This is represented as concentric circles around the BMC.

### The Four Forces

#### **1. Market Forces**
**Key Questions to Answer:**

| Question | Why It Matters | 3D Printing Platform Example |
|----------|----------------|------------------------------|
| What are the key market issues? | Reveals tailwinds/headwinds | Supply chain disruptions → Need for local suppliers |
| Where is the market heading? | Ensures you're not building for yesterday | Shift from centralized to distributed manufacturing |
| Most important customer segments? | Focuses your limited resources | Aerospace (high-value, certified) vs. Consumer (low-value, uncertified) |
| Biggest growth potential? | Identifies where to invest | Medical 3D printing growing 25%/year |
| Where is demand increasing/decreasing? | Avoids dying markets | Demand for speed/certification UP; demand for lowest price DOWN |
| How easy is it to switch? | Indicates stickiness/moat | If switching costs are LOW, we need network effects to retain customers |
| What are customers willing to pay for? | Validates revenue model | Speed premium exists ("Lead time is a big deal") |

**Application to Our Platform:**
- **Issue:** Supply chain fragmentation post-COVID/tariffs
- **Segments:** Manufacturers (buyers), 3D Facilities (suppliers), Labs (certifiers)
- **Growth:** Distributed manufacturing, Industry 4.0
- **Switching Costs:** Currently LOW (lots of marketplaces) → We need to create LOCK-IN through data/network
- **Revenue:** Speed, certification, quality of match (NOT just volume)

---

#### **2. Industry Forces (Competitive Analysis)**
**Key Questions:**

| Force | Questions | Our Platform Analysis |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Competitors** | Who are dominant players? Advantages/disadvantages? | Xometry, Hubs, 3D Hubs → Advantage: Scale. Disadvantage: Not specialized, poor matching quality |
| **New Entrants** | Who? How are they different? | AI-powered matching platforms, OEM-specific networks → Threat: They may out-specialize us |
| **Substitute Products** | What could replace us? | In-house 3D printing, traditional machining, direct OEM relationships → We must be 10x better than DIY |
| **Suppliers** | Key players in value chain? | 3D printer OEMs (Stratasys, 3D Systems), material suppliers → Do we depend on them? Can they bypass us? |
| **Stakeholders** | Who influences your model? | Regulators (certifications), Industry associations, Equipment manufacturers → Can they block us? |

**Critical Insight from Curriculum:**
> "Does your business model depend on others?"

If YES (and ours does—we depend on suppliers joining the platform), then you have a **chicken-and-egg problem** to solve. The BMC must address how you'll seed the marketplace.

---

#### **3. Key Trends (Foresight)**
**The Four Trend Categories:**

**A. Technology Trends**
- **Question:** Major trends inside/outside your market? Opportunities? Disruptive threats?
- **For Us:**
  - *Opportunity:* AI/IoT quality systems ("Getting AI and IoT is getting more"—from our interview) → We can integrate
  - *Threat:* Fully automated design-to-production systems → Could bypass human matchmaking

**B. Regulatory Trends**
- **Question:** Who regulates? Which regulations affect your business model?
- **For Us:**
  - ISO certifications for manufacturers
  - Data privacy laws (GDPR, PIPEDA) for platform data
  - Export controls for certain 3D-printed parts (aerospace, defense)

**C. Society and Culture Trends**
- **Question:** What shifts in cultural/societal values affect your model?
- **For Us:**
  - Shift to "local/sustainable" manufacturing (reduces shipping emissions)
  - Emphasis on supply chain resilience (geopolitical risk)
  - Maker movement / democratization of manufacturing

**D. Socioeconomic Trends**
- **Question:** Key demographic trends? Income distribution? Spending patterns?
- **For Us:**
  - Manufacturing "reshoring" to North America → Creates demand for local 3D capacity
  - SMB vs. Enterprise budgets → Different pricing tiers needed

---

#### **4. Macroeconomic Forces**
**The Big Picture Context:**

| Force | Questions | Platform Impact |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Global Market Conditions** | Boom or bust? GDP growth? | Recession = Less R&D spending = Fewer prototypes ordered |
| **Capital Markets** | How easy to secure investment? | Affects OUR fundraising AND our customers' budgets |
| **Commodities/Resources** | Cost and availability of materials | 3D printing materials (plastics, metals) → Price fluctuations affect supplier costs |
| **Economic Infrastructure** | Transportation? Regulations? Energy? | Tariffs on cross-border shipping → Increases value of LOCAL suppliers |

**Example from Our Interview:**
Bassey mentioned **tariffs forcing them to source from Germany instead of US**. This is a macroeconomic force (trade policy) directly impacting the value of a "local supplier matching" platform.

---

### Ecosystem Mapping Exercise

The curriculum provides a visual framework for mapping the FULL ecosystem:

```
        [Regulators]
              ↑
              │ (Compliance Certification)
              │
     [Research & Development]
              ↑
              │ (New Technologies)
              │
    [Suppliers] ←─────→ [YOUR PLATFORM] ←─────→ [Customers]
         ↓                                           ↓
    (Materials)                              (Finished Parts)
         ↓                                           ↓
  [Equipment OEMs]                         [Distributors/Retailers]
         ↓                                           ↓
    (Machines)                              (End Consumers)
```

**The Three Flows:**
1. **Flow of Goods/Materials:** Physical logistics (3D printers, materials, printed parts)
2. **Flow of Information:** Design files, certifications, specifications, orders
3. **Flow of Money:** Payments, commissions, subscriptions

**Critical Question:**
Where does YOUR platform sit in this flow? We are primarily in the **Flow of Information** (connecting buyers, suppliers, labs) and the **Flow of Money** (transactions, commissions).

<a name="customer-discovery"></a>
## 🔍 PART 6: CUSTOMER DISCOVERY PROCESS DEEP DIVE

### Purpose of Customer Discovery (The "Why")

#### **1. Validate Problem-Solution Fit**
**Definition:** Confirm the problem is real AND your proposed solution addresses their pain points.

**NOT:** "Do you like our idea?"  
**YES:** "Does this problem exist? Is it painful? Would this solution help?"

#### **2. Test Assumptions with Evidence**
**Definition:** Use rapid experimentation via interviews and observations to turn hypotheses into validated learning, thereby reducing market risk.

**Key Principle:**
> Assumptions remain assumptions until tested. Evidence (customer quotes, behavior) is the only truth.

#### **3. Improve Odds of Product-Market Fit (PMF)**
**Stat from Curriculum:**
> Startups that rigorously and continuously practice customer discovery have a SIGNIFICANTLY higher chance of achieving product-market fit.

**Why?**
Because they build what customers actually need, not what founders THINK customers need.

---

### Principles of Customer Discovery

#### **Principle #1: Testable Hypotheses**
**Rule:** Formulate clear, testable assumptions about customer needs or behaviors.

**Example from Curriculum:**
> "Customers will pay for a meal delivery service."

**Why This is Testable:**
- Sample: 30 potential customers
- Test: Offer pre-orders at $X/meal
- Metric: If >30% convert, hypothesis validated

**For Our Platform:**
- Hypothesis: "Manufacturers will pay $10K/year for priority supplier matching"
- Test: Offer to 30 procurement managers at that price
- Metric: If >20% say yes, hypothesis validated

#### **Principle #2: Problem Over Solution**
**Rule:** Focus on understanding the customer's problem BEFORE proposing solutions.

**Example from Curriculum:**
> ❌ "Would you use an app that finds 3D printing suppliers?"  
> ✅ "What is your biggest frustration with current tools for finding suppliers?"

**Why?**
The second question reveals the ACTUAL problem. Maybe it's not "finding" suppliers (there are lots of directories), but "VETTING" suppliers (trust/certification). Now you can build for the real pain.

#### **Principle #3: Unbiased Conversations**
**Rule:** Engage with customers openly, avoiding leading questions.

**Example from Curriculum:**
> ❌ "Don't you think faster delivery would be valuable?"  
> ✅ "Tell me about the last time you needed a part quickly."

**Why?**
Leading questions get you the answer you want to hear, not the truth. The second question lets the customer tell their story.

#### **Principle #4: Iterate on Feedback**
**Rule:** Refine your assumptions based on customer input.

**Outcome:** Improved product-market fit and higher adoption rates (reduce market risk).

**The Loop:**
```
Hypothesis → Test → Learn → Refine Hypothesis → Test Again
```

---

### Customer Discovery IS...

1. **A way to (in)validate business model hypotheses**
   - Hypotheses are written on the BMC
   - Interviews test them
   - Update BMC based on evidence

2. **A way to understand people and their motivations**
   - Who are they? (Demographics, role, context)
   - What problems do they have? (Pains)
   - Why do those problems matter? (The "why" behind the pain)

3. **A way to learn about your ecosystem**
   - Who else is involved in the decision?
   - What are the competitive alternatives?
   - What regulations apply?

4. **Reduces risk of building something that nobody wants or needs**
   - The #1 reason startups fail is: No market need
   - Customer discovery prevents this

---

### Customer Discovery is NOT...

1. **NOT collecting a list of product 'features'**
   - Customers will tell you "I want a button that does X"
   - That's not valuable
   - You need to know WHY they want that button (underlying pain)

2. **NOT running a bunch of focus groups**
   - Focus groups are artificial environments
   - Group dynamics skew responses
   - 1-on-1 conversations are more honest

3. **NOT selling your product/service**
   - If you start pitching, they'll stop being honest
   - They'll be polite instead of truthful

---

### The Customer Discovery Process (Step-by-Step)

```
1. Identify Organizations
   └─→ Which companies fit your customer segment hypothesis?

2. Identify People
   └─→ Which roles at those companies have the problem?

3. Reach Out (Phone/Email)
   └─→ Use warm intros or craft compelling cold outreach

4. Conduct Interview
   └─→ Use the 4-part formula

5. Understand Job, Problems, Needs
   └─→ Extract insights about their context and pains

6. REPEAT (Iterate and expand)
   └─→ 100 times!
```

**Critical Note from Curriculum:**
> "Customer discovery: a NON-LINEAR process"

**What This Means:**
You won't go 1→2→3→4 in a straight line. You'll:
- Interview 5 people, realize you're targeting the wrong segment
- Go back to step 1, identify NEW organizations
- Interview 10 more, discover a NEW problem you hadn't considered
- Update your BMC, revise your questions
- Keep iterating

<a name="100-interviews"></a>
## 💯 PART 7: THE PATH TO 100 INTERVIEWS

### Why 100?

The curriculum is explicit:

**Reasons:**
1. **It's a good start** → Not arbitrary; based on Lean Startup research
2. **Data drives results** → Can't make decisions on n=5
3. **Pattern recognition and analysis (statistical significance)** → Patterns emerge around ~30 interviews
4. **Test hypotheses from many angles** → Different industries, roles, geographies

### The Insight Curve

**Curriculum Graph:**
```
Number of Insights
    ↑
    │                    ╱────────
    │                  ╱
    │                ╱
    │              ╱
    │            ╱
    │          ╱
    │        ╱
    │      ╱
    │────╱──────────────────────→
         ~30          Time (Number of Interviews)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **0-30 interviews:** Steep learning curve. Each interview generates big insights.
- **30+ interviews:** Curve flattens. Insights become incremental (you're seeing patterns, not discovering NEW patterns).

**For Our Project:**
We've done 1 interview (Bassey). We're at the STEEPEST part of the curve. Every interview right now is GOLD.

---

### Interview Cadence (The Schedule)

**Target:** 100 interviews by **March 26, 2026**

| Week Ending | New Interviews | Cumulative Total |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Feb 5, 2026 | 15 | 15 |
| Feb 12 | 15 | 30 |
| Feb 19 | 15 | 45 |
| Mar 5 | 15 | 60 |
| Mar 12 | 15 | 75 |
| Mar 19 | 15 | 90 |
| Mar 26 | 10 | **100** |

**Reality Check from Curriculum:**
> "Securing an interview can take weeks. Don't expect to reach out to 15 people and get 15 interviews."

**Conversion Rate:**
- **Typical:** For every **15 requests** → **~5 responses** → **1-3 confirmed interviews**
- **Conversion:** 10-20%

**Implication:**
To get 15 interviews/week, we need to make **75-150 NEW requests each week**.

---

### Sourcing Strategy

**The Curriculum's Recommended Sequence:**

#### **Phase 1: Warm Contacts (Week 1-2)**
- Leverage YOUR network
- Team Lead (TL) intros
- Mentor intros
- Other L2M team intros

**Why Start Here:**
- Highest conversion rate (40-60% for warm intros vs. 5-10% cold)
- Fastest to schedule
- More forgiving if you mess up (practicing!)

#### **Phase 2: LinkedIn Professional (Week 2-4)**
- Use Advanced Search filters (Title, Industry, Company Size, Location)
- Send personalized connection requests
- Engage with their content before reaching out

**Pro Tip:**
> "Try LinkedIn Professional, it's worth it" (from curriculum)

The upgrade allows more search filters and InMail credits (messages to non-connections).

#### **Phase 3: Web Search & AI (Week 3+)**
- Corporate websites (find roles)
- Industry associations (member directories)
- Google Alerts (monitor for news about target companies)
- AI tools (Gemini Deep Research for niche expert finding)

#### **Phase 4: Referrals (Continuous)**
- **Always** end interviews with: "Who else should I talk to?"
- Warm intros from interviewees have the HIGHEST conversion
- Creates a "snowball effect"

### Interview Planning: The Math

**To get 15 interviews/week:**

**Option A (Conservative 10% conversion):**
- 150 requests/week
- ~21 requests/day (if working 7 days)
- ~4 hours/day on outreach alone

**Option B (Optimistic 20% conversion from referrals):**
- 75 requests/week
- ~11 requests/day
- ~2 hours/day on outreach

**How to Craft Your Message:**
The curriculum emphasizes quality matters:
- **Personalized** (reference their company, recent post, mutual connection)
- **Specific** (not "can I pick your brain" but "I'm researching X and your experience with Y is relevant")
- **Low-ask** (15-20 minutes, not "an hour of your time")
- **Student angle** ("As a student/researcher..." gets sympathy)

## 📊 PART 8: DATA QUALITY & BIAS MANAGEMENT

### The Marcus Aurelius Principle

The curriculum quotes:

> **"Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."**

### The Parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant

**Visual from Curriculum:**
Six blind men touch different parts of an elephant:
- One touches the sail (trunk)
- One touches a rope (tail)
- One touches a whale (body)
- One touches a harpoon (tusk)
- One touches an eel (trunk moving)
- One touches a wharf (leg)

**The Lesson:**
Everyone is correct FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE, but no one sees the whole truth.

**Application:**
- Interview 1: "Finding suppliers is the problem"
- Interview 2: "Vetting suppliers is the problem"
- Interview 3: "Speed of delivery is the problem"

All three could be TRUE simultaneously (different parts of the elephant). You need MANY perspectives to see the whole.

---

### The Four Cognitive Biases

#### **1. Anchoring Bias**
**Definition:** Depending too heavily on an initial piece of information (the "anchor") when making subsequent judgments.

**Example:**
- Interviewee: "Lead time is usually 3-4 weeks."
- You: "Oh, so 3 weeks is acceptable?"
- Interviewee: "Yeah, 3 weeks is fine."

**The Problem:**
You anchored them to "3-4 weeks." Maybe they actually think 1-2 weeks would be ideal, but you framed 3 as the baseline.

**How to Avoid:**
> ✅ "What would an ideal lead time be for you?"  
> (Let THEM set the anchor, not you)

---

#### **2. Confirmation Bias**
**Definition:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs.

**Example:**
You believe "Manufacturers hate slow suppliers."
- Interviewee: "Sometimes suppliers are slow, but we usually manage."
- You interpret: "See! They hate slow suppliers!" (ignoring "we usually manage")

**The Problem:**
You're cherry-picking evidence that fits your hypothesis.

**How to Avoid:**
- Actively look for DISCONFIRMING evidence
- Ask: "What would prove me WRONG?"
- Have someone else (teammate) review the interview independently

---

#### **3. Suggestibility Bias**
**Definition:** Being inclined to accept and act on the suggestions of others.

**Example:**
- You: "It must be frustrating when suppliers are late, right?"
- Interviewee: "Yeah, I guess so."

**The Problem:**
You SUGGESTED frustration. They agreed to be polite, not because it's actually a big problem.

**How to Avoid:**
> ✅ "Tell me about the last time a supplier was late. What happened?"  
> (Let them describe their emotion, don't suggest it)

---

#### **4. Insensitivity to Sample Size**
**Definition:** Judging the validity or significance of information without consideration of sample size.

**Example:**
- After 3 interviews, all say "Lead time is critical"
- You conclude: "This is THE problem across the industry!"

**The Problem:**
n=3 is not statistically significant. You might have randomly picked 3 people in the same niche.

**How to Avoid:**
- Don't draw conclusions until ~30 interviews
- Test across DIFFERENT sub-segments (different industries, company sizes, geographies)

---

### DO's of Customer Discovery

1. **More interviews is better than fewer** → 100 > 10
2. **Get comfortable with being uncomfortable** → You'll struggle; get creative
3. **Focus on corporate AND employee problems** → Both levels matter
4. **Listen and observe** → 80/20 rule (80% them, 20% you)
5. **Watch for patterns; iterate/pivot accordingly** → Flexibility is key

---

### DON'Ts of Customer Discovery

1. **DO NOT assume you understand the problem** → You DON'T (yet)
2. **DO NOT interview people you already know** → They'll be nice to you = biased
3. **DO NOT avoid hard truths** → Be ready to pivot
4. **DO NOT SELL!** → You're learning, not closing
5. **DO NOT abandon hope** → It's hard, but it works

---

### Tips and Tricks from the Curriculum

#### **Leverage Your Student Status**
> "Take advantage of the fact that you are a student or post-doc"

**Why It Works:**
- People like helping students (feels good, low-threat)
- "Student research" is more respectable than "sales call"
- Academic affiliation (Memorial, Lab2Market) adds credibility

#### **Ask for "Advice" Not "Interview"**
> "Ask for insights and advice, not specifically an 'interview'"

**Script:**
❌ "Can I interview you about 3D printing?"  
✅ "I'm researching challenges in 3D printing sourcing, and your expertise would be invaluable. Could I get 15 minutes of your advice?"

#### **The Penultimate Question**
> "Is there anything you would like to add?"

**Why This Works:**
- Gives them control
- Often surfaces their TOP concern (the thing they wanted to say but you didn't ask)
- Shows you value their input beyond your script

#### **Always Ask for Referrals**
> "Always ask for referrals before concluding the interview"

**Why:**
- Warm intros convert 4-6x better than cold
- Compounds your network exponentially
- Signals trust (they wouldn't refer you if you were bad)

## 🛡️ PART 9: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGY (DEEP DIVE)

**Presenter:** Dr. Dion Hicks, Memorial's Research Innovation Office (RIO)

### What IS Intellectual Property?

**Legal Definition (from curriculum):**
> "Includes all data, documents, reports, analyses, tests, specifications, charts, plans, drawings, ideas, inventions, discoveries, creations, schemes, correspondence, communications, lists, manuals, technology, techniques, methods, processes, services, routines, systems, procedures, practices, operations, modes of operations, know-how, trade or other secrets, contracts, financial information, engineering reports, environmental reports, field notes, sketches, photographs, computer programs, records or software, specifications, models, database rights, service marks, scientific or technical advancements, improvements, devices, products, concepts, designs, prototypes, samples, technical information, materials, works of authorship, patterns or other information..."

**Simple Definition:**
> "An intangible creation of the mind, expressed or translated into a tangible form, that can be legally protected."

---

### Why Learn About IP?

**The Four Reasons:**

1. **You can create new knowledge**  
   - Your platform's matching algorithm is IP
   - Your database schema is IP
   - Your brand is IP

2. **You have rights**  
   - You can protect your creations
   - You can prevent others from copying

3. **IP has value and can be commercialized**  
   - IP can be sold (assignment)
   - IP can be licensed (retain ownership, grant usage rights)
   - IP can be used as collateral for loans

4. **Respect the rights of others**  
   - Don't infringe on others' IP
   - Check "freedom to operate"

---

### The 5 Types of IP (Detailed Comparison)

#### **1. COPYRIGHT**

**What It Protects:**
- Expression of ideas (NOT the ideas themselves)
- Examples: Writing, music, fine art, computer programs

**Duration:**
- Life of creator + 70 years

**Protection:**
- Automatic (in most jurisdictions)
- Can register for stronger legal standing

**Geographic Scope:**
- Worldwide (via Berne Convention)

**For Software Platforms:**
- ✅ Protects source code
- ✅ Protects UI/UX design
- ✅ Protects written content (blog posts, help docs)
- ❌ Does NOT protect functionality/features
- ❌ Does NOT protect algorithms (logic)

**Critical Caveat from Curriculum:**
> "The functionality of computer programs is NOT protected by copyright"

**Implication:**
If a competitor reverse-engineers your platform and rebuilds the same features (without copying your code), copyright does NOT stop them.

**Open Source Warning:**
> "Modifying 'open source' code may have other copyright obligations. Pay attention to terms in the license."

**Example:** If you use GPL-licensed code, you may be REQUIRED to open-source YOUR code. This is bad for commercial platforms.

---

#### **2. TRADE SECRETS**

**What It Protects:**
- Information that derives value FROM secrecy

**Duration:**
- Indefinite (as long as kept secret)

**Protection:**
- No registration
- Maintained through security measures (NDAs, encryption, access controls)

**Examples from Curriculum:**
- Coca-Cola's formula (100+ years secret)
- Google's search algorithm
- KFC's recipe

**For Our Platform:**
- ✅ Matching algorithm logic
- ✅ Supplier vetting criteria
- ✅ Pricing optimization formulas
- ✅ Customer/supplier data (proprietary datasets)

**Tools to Maintain:**
- Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with employees, partners
- Encryption of databases
- Password protection
- Physical locks (servers)

**Risk:**
If the secret is disclosed (accidentally or by reverse-engineering), protection is LOST forever.

**When to Use:**
- Before applying for other protection (patent pending)
- When invention has short lifespan (no time for 20-year patent)
- When you CAN'T protect through other rights (e.g., recipe—not patentable in many places)

---

#### **3. PATENTS**

**What It Protects:**
- Novel, useful, and non-obvious inventions

**Duration:**
- 20 years from filing date

**Protection:**
- Must be secured in EACH jurisdiction (expensive!)
- Public disclosure required (teaches others how it works)

**Types of Patentable Inventions:**
- Products (devices)
- Compositions (materials)
- Machines
- Processes (methods)
- Improvements to the above

**Requirements:**
1. **Novel:** Never been done before (anywhere in the world)
2. **Useful:** Has a practical application
3. **Non-Obvious:** Not an obvious solution to someone skilled in the field

**For Software Platforms:**
- ❌ Generally HARD to patent software (especially in US post-Alice Corp.)
- ✅ Possible for specific technical inventions (e.g., "System and method for real-time 3D printability analysis using geometric heuristics")
- ⚠️ Expensive ($10K-$50K+ to file and maintain)

**Examples from Curriculum:**
- Recyclable cardboard bicycle (Abandoned) → Idea didn't work; patent lapsed
- Sea Cucumber Processing Apparatus (Active) → Novel industrial process

**The Trade-Off:**
- **Patent:** 20 years of exclusive rights, BUT you must publicly disclose how it works
- **Trade Secret:** Indefinite protection, BUT if someone reverse-engineers, you have no recourse

**When to Patent:**
- When you need to prevent competitors from copying (and you're willing to disclose how it works)
- When you can't keep it secret (it's visible in the product)
- When you plan to license the tech to others

---

#### **4. INDUSTRIAL DESIGN**

**What It Protects:**
- The visual design, features, and look of a product

**Duration:**
- 15 years (Canada)

**Requirements:**
- Must provide a competitive edge
- Includes shapes, patterns, layouts

**Examples from Curriculum:**
- MUNE musical instrument (Canadian Industrial Design 148812)
- iPhone icon jiggle mode (Canadian Industrial Design 138957)
- Dyson handheld vacuum (US Patent D819444)
- Coca-Cola bottle (Serial Number: 8423911)

**For Our Platform:**
- 🟡 Potentially relevant for UI design (if visually distinctive)
- 🟡 More relevant for physical products (3D-printed parts themselves)

**Note:**
Industrial design is SEPARATE from copyright (protects functional aspects of design, not just artistic).

---

#### **5. TRADEMARKS**

**What It Protects:**
- Words, sounds, or designs that distinguish a product/service

**Duration:**
- 10 years (Canada), renewable indefinitely

**Types:**
- Word marks ("Apple")
- Design marks (Apple logo)
- Sound marks (Star Wars lightsaber sound)

**Requirements for Registration:**
Must be:
- ✅ Distinctive and arbitrary (e.g., "Kodak" for cameras)
- ❌ NOT deceptive (e.g., "Real Leather" for fake leather)
- ❌ NOT a surname (e.g., "Smith Furniture")
- ❌ NOT a place name (e.g., "St. John's Furniture")
- ❌ NOT merely descriptive (e.g., "Apple Farm" for apples)
- ❌ NOT confusingly similar (e.g., "Starbux" too close to "Starbucks")
- ❌ NOT already in use (jurisdiction-specific)

**Examples from Curriculum:**
- Apple Logo (Serial Number: 0917612)
- Memorial University Design Mark (Serial Number: 3064984)
- Google Logo (Serial Number: 86912587)
- Star Wars Lightsaber Sound (Serial Number: 77419246)

**For Our Platform:**
- ✅ Brand name (the platform's name)
- ✅ Logo
- ✅ Tagline (e.g., "Certified 3D Printing, Delivered Fast")

**Strategy:**
- Register early (before launch) to secure rights
- File in all jurisdictions where you'll operate
- Monitor for infringement (others using confusingly similar marks)

---

### IP and AI (Critical for Our Platform)

**Key Points from Curriculum:**

1. **IP rights are determined by data**
   - If we train AI on supplier data, WHO owns the output?
   - If we use customer designs, do we have rights to derivative works?

2. **Need ownership/permission to use data**
   - Terms of Service must grant us license to process uploaded data
   - Privacy policies must disclose how data is used

3. **AI cannot be an inventor**
   - If our AI "invents" a new matching algorithm, we can't patent it with "AI" as inventor
   - Must attribute to a human (the developer who trained it)

4. **New laws are being developed**
   - EU AI Act
   - US Executive Orders on AI
   - Stay updated!

5. **Jurisdiction specific**
   - Different rules in Canada vs. US vs. EU

---

### How to Utilize Your IP (Monetization)

**Three Strategies:**

#### **1. Exploit: Direct Use**
- **Sell:** Create the product/service and sell it (our platform's primary model)
- **Create/Manufacture:** Build and operate the platform
- **Brand:** Use trademarks to build trust

#### **2. Assign: Transfer Ownership**
- Sell the IP outright to another company
- One-time payment
- You lose all future rights

**When to Use:**
- Exit strategy (acquisition)
- Need immediate capital
- Can't commercialize yourself

#### **3. License: Retain Ownership, Grant Usage**
- Keep ownership
- Allow others to use it (for a fee)
- Can be exclusive or non-exclusive

**When to Use:**
- Want recurring revenue (royalties)
- Can't scale globally yourself (license to regional partners)
- Want to maintain control

**Example for Our Platform:**
- **Exploit:** Operate the platform directly (SaaS model)
- **License:** White-label the matching engine to large OEMs for their internal networks
- **Assign:** Sell the entire platform to a competitor (exit)

---

### Developing an IP Strategy

**Why It Matters:**

1. **Identifies long-term commercialization pathway**
   - Are we licensing or selling?
   - What's protectable vs. open?

2. **Boosts funding and partnership opportunities**
   - Investors want to see defensible IP
   - Partners want assurance you won't be easily copied

3. **Helps prevent public disclosures**
   - Accidentally revealing trade secrets
   - Disclosing patentable inventions before filing

4. **Determines freedom to operate**
   - Are we infringing on others' patents?
   - Can we operate without lawsuits?

5. **Guides research direction**
   - Focus R&D on patentable innovations
   - Avoid areas with heavy IP blocking

6. **Avoids costly rework**
   - Don't build on someone else's patented tech
   - Don't use trademarks you can't defend

---

### Student IP Considerations

**The curriculum highlights four questions:**

#### **1. Institution's IP Policy**
- Memorial University may claim ownership of IP created by students/faculty
- Check your student agreement

#### **2. Who Created the IP?**
- Sole inventor vs. co-inventors
- Inventorship vs. authorship (different legal meanings)

#### **3. How Was the Research Funded?**
- If funded by grants, funders may have IP rights
- Industry sponsors may have first right of refusal

#### **4. Connect with Your Tech Transfer Office**
- Memorial's RIO can help navigate
- They have lawyers who specialize in IP

**Inventorship vs. Authorship:**
> "Who discovered the invention? What were your contributions? Performing experiments is NOT inventorship."

**Example:**
- If you run tests based on someone else's idea → You're an author (of the paper), not an inventor (of the patent)
- If you conceived the idea AND reduced it to practice → You're an inventor

---

### Pitching Without Disclosing (Critical Skill)

**The Challenge:**
You need to interview customers to validate your idea, BUT you can't disclose your trade secrets or invalidate future patents.

**The Solution:**
> "Avoid discussing enabling information. Maintain confidentiality until protected. **What it does, not how it does it.**"

**Examples:**

| ❌ Don't Say (How) | ✅ Do Say (What) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "We use a neural network trained on 10 million part specifications to predict printability with 95% accuracy" | "We can tell you if a part is printable before you upload the design" |
| "Our matching algorithm uses cosine similarity on feature vectors with weighted penalties for geographic distance" | "We match you with the best supplier based on your specific needs" |
| "We scrape certification databases and cross-reference them with supplier profiles every 24 hours" | "We ensure suppliers are certified and up-to-date" |

**The Principle:**
- Customers care about OUTCOMES (faster, cheaper, certified)
- They don't care about MECHANISMS (algorithms, data structures)
- Save mechanisms for when you're protected (patent filed, trade secret secured)

---

<a name="platform-applications"></a>
## 🚀 PART 10: APPLYING WEEK 3 TO OUR PLATFORM

### Strategic IP Layering

For a software platform like ours, we need MULTIPLE layers of IP protection:

**Layer 1: Copyright (Code & Content)**
- Protects our source code from being copied
- Protects UI designs, documentation, blog posts
- **Action:** Automatic, but add © notices and register key works

**Layer 2: Trade Secrets (Algorithms & Data)**
- Our matching algorithm logic (secret sauce)
- Supplier vetting criteria
- Pricing optimization formulas
- Customer behavior data (proprietary dataset)
- **Action:** NDAs for all employees/contractors, encryption, access controls

**Layer 3: Trademarks (Brand)**
- Platform name and logo
- Tagline
- **Action:** Register in Canada, US, and key markets BEFORE launch

**Layer 4: Patents (Maybe)**
- IF we develop a truly novel technical invention (e.g., a new geometric analysis for 3D printability)
- **Action:** File provisional patent if we discover something patentable

**Layer 5: Contracts (Terms of Service)**
- Define data ownership
- Grant us license to process user data
- Limit liability
- **Action:** Engage IP lawyer to draft before launch

---

### Product-Market Fit Meets IP Strategy

**The Integration:**

```
Customer Discovery → Reveals Problem → Build Solution → Protect Solution
        ↓                   ↓                ↓              ↓
   Interviews          Validated Pain     MVP Features   IP Strategy
```

**Example:**
1. **Discovery:** Interviews reveal manufacturers struggle with supplier certification verification
2. **Problem:** They waste 2 weeks verifying each supplier's credentials
3. **Solution:** Build automated certification checker (scrapes official databases, cross-references)
4. **IP Protection:**
   - **Trade Secret:** How we scrape and cross-reference (don't disclose)
   - **Patent:** Maybe (novel method of automated credential verification?)
   - **Copyright:** The software itself
   - **Trademark:** The "Verified Supplier" badge design

---

### BMC + IP Matrix

For each BMC block, consider IP implications:

| BMC Block | IP Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Value Proposition** | Patent, Trade Secret | Novel matching algorithm |
| **Customer Segments** | Trade Secret | Proprietary customer segmentation data |
| **Channels** | Trademark | Brand on marketing materials |
| **Customer Relationships** | Copyright, Trade Secret | CRM software, customer communication templates |
| **Revenue Streams** | Trade Secret | Pricing algorithm |
| **Key Resources** | Copyright, Trade Secret, Patent | Software code, databases, algorithms |
| **Key Activities** | Trade Secret | Supplier vetting process |
| **Key Partners** | Contracts | Partnership agreements with IP clauses |
| **Cost Structure** | Trade Secret | Cost optimization formulas |

---

### Interview Script Refinement (Post-IP Learning)

**Before IP Workshop:**
❌ "We're building a platform that uses machine learning to match buyers with 3D printing suppliers based on capability, certification, and location. What do you think?"

**After IP Workshop:**
✅ "We're researching challenges in finding certified 3D printing suppliers. Can you walk me through the last time you needed to source a custom part? What was the hardest part?"

**Why This is Better:**
- Doesn't disclose "machine learning" (trade secret/potential patent)
- Doesn't disclose matching criteria (trade secret)
- Focuses on THEIR problem, not OUR solution
- Preserves IP while validating the pain

---

### The 100 Interview IP Risk

**Challenge:**
If we interview 100 people and describe our solution, we risk:
1. Public disclosure (invalidates future patents)
2. Someone copying the idea (no protection yet)

**Solution:**
- Focus interviews on PROBLEM validation (first 50-70 interviews)
- Only describe solution in VAGUE terms ("We're building a platform to connect buyers and suppliers")
- Get NDAs from strategic partners/advisors before detailed disclosure
- File provisional patent (if applicable) BEFORE broad disclosure

---

## 📝 WEEKLY REFLECTION & ACTION ITEMS

### Key Takeaways from Week 3

1. **Business Model is a Hypothesis Set**
   - The BMC is not a "plan" but a testable framework
   - Every box is an assumption until validated

2. **100 Interviews is Not Arbitrary**
   - Pattern recognition requires sample size
   - Insights emerge around n=30
   - 100 gives statistical confidence

3. **Problem > Solution**
   - Fall in love with the problem, not your solution
   - Customers don't care about features; they care about outcomes

4. **IP is Multi-Layered**
   - No single IP type protects everything
   - Need a portfolio (Copyright + Trade Secrets + Trademarks)
   - Software platforms rely heavily on trade secrets

5. **Pitch Without Disclosing**
   - "What" not "How"
   - Protect trade secrets while validating market

---

### Action Items for Week 4

Based on Week 3 curriculum, we should:

**1. Interview Planning**
- [ ] Build list of 150 potential contacts (to get 15 interviews by Feb 5)
- [ ] Categorize by segment (Client, Facility, Lab, OEM, Authority)
- [ ] Draft personalized outreach messages (using tips from curriculum)

**2. BMC Refinement**
- [ ] Fill out full BMC with current hypotheses
- [ ] Add "Business Environment" layer (Market Forces, Industry Forces, Trends, Macroeconomics)
- [ ] Identify top 3 RISKIEST assumptions to test first

**3. Interview Script v2.0**
- [ ] Rewrite questions to avoid suggestibility bias
- [ ] Add "pitching without disclosing" language
- [ ] Create specific follow-up probes for when patterns emerge

**4. IP Protection**
- [ ] Draft Terms of Service with data ownership clauses
- [ ] Create NDAs for strategic advisors
- [ ] Document trade secrets (what we're keeping confidential)
- [ ] Conduct preliminary trademark search for platform name

**5. Bias Management**
- [ ] Set up peer review process (teammate checks for confirmation bias)
- [ ] Create "disconfirmation checklist" (what would prove us wrong?)
- [ ] Log all interviews in CRM with RAW quotes (not interpretations)

---

### Questions for Facilitator/Team Lead

1. **On IP:** Should we file provisional patent on matching algorithm before broad market disclosure?
2. **On Interviews:** Can TL/Mentor provide 5-10 warm intros to accelerate Week 4 outreach?
3. **On BMC:** Which BMC block is highest-risk for our platform? (Should we test first?)
4. **On Bias:** How do we balance "learning mode" with needing to eventually pitch investors?

## 🎓 FINAL SYNTHESIS

Week 3 taught us that entrepreneurship is fundamentally an **evidence-gathering exercise**.

**The Meta-Framework:**

```
          Hypotheses (BMC)
                ↓
        Customer Discovery
         (100 Interviews)
                ↓
        Validated Learning
                ↓
        Iterate Business Model
                ↓
        Build MVP (Agile)
                ↓
        Product-Market Fit
```

**Overlaying IP Strategy:**

```
         Problem Discovered
                ↓
       Solution Conceived
                ↓
       IP Strategy Developed
    (Protect before disclosure)
                ↓
       Build & Launch
                ↓
       Commercialize
      (Exploit/License/Assign)
```

**The Integration:**
We don't build first, then test. We don't pitch first, then protect. We work in PARALLEL:
- **Discover** the problem (interviews)
- **Protect** the solution (IP)
- **Build** the minimum viable product (agile)
- **Iterate** based on evidence (lean)

This is the Lab2Market methodology. Week 3 gave us the foundational tools. Weeks 4-10 will be about applying them rigorously.
