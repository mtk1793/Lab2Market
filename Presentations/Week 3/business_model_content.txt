RECAP

Lab2Market Prime Directive
Your job is to
validate that a problem/need exists,
understand who has it
and, only then,
determine how best to solve it.
You are not trying to educate your customers;
you are trying to learn from them.

Talking to humans

Be yourself
Be real; be you

2.
Find the right people
Referrals + web/AI (industry groups, conferences, etc.)

The interview ‘formula’
Part 1: The welcome
Purpose of interview (2 – 3 minutes)
o
Part 2: Positioning your customer
Ask about their company/job; seek their advice
o
Part 3: Rank the problem
Nice to have; need to have; don’t want/need
o
Part 4: The hook
Would you mind if I follow up? Can you suggest others?
o
Leverage the power of ‘why’

Business Model Design

Lean Startup Method
• Risk reduction methodology
• Three components:
• Business Model (framework of core business
assumptions and hypotheses)
• Customer Discovery (a way to test core
assumptions and hypotheses)
• Agile Engineering (iterative product development)

Describes how your startup creates, delivers

and captures value.

Customer Discovery:
The basics

Customer discovery: Purpose
Validate Problem–Solution Fit
Engage early with potential customers to confirm the problem is
real and your proposed solution addresses their pain points.
Test Assumptions with Evidence
Use rapid experimentation via interviews, observations to turn
hypotheses into validated learning and thereby reduce market
risk.
Improve Odds of PMF
Startups that rigorously and continuously practice customer
discovery have a significantly higher chance of achieving
product–market fit.

Principles of customer discovery
Testable Hypotheses Unbiased Conversations
Formulate clear, testable
Engage with customers openly,
assumptions about customer needs
avoiding leading questions. Example:
or behaviours. Example: 'Customers
'Tell me about the last time you used
will pay for a meal delivery.’ (Recall
[similar product].'
Carol’s example)
Problem Over Solution Iterate on Feedback
Focus on understanding the Refine your assumptions based on
customer's problem before proposing customer input. Outcome: Improved
solutions. Example: 'What is your product-market fit and higher
biggest frustration with current adoption rates. (Reduce market risk)
tools?’ (Learn, don’t teach)

Customer Discovery is:
• A way to (in)validate business model hypotheses
• A way to understand people (future customers)
and their motivations (problem/need)
• A way to learn about your ecosystem
• Reduces risk of building something that nobody
wants or needs

Customer Discovery is not:
• Collecting a list of product ‘features’ from
prospective customers
• Running a bunch of focus groups
• Selling your product/service

Customer Discovery Process

Identify people
Understand their job,
problems/needs

100 Customer Interviews
By March 26, 2026

Customer interviews – why 100?
• It’s a good start
• Data drives results
• Pattern recognition and analysis (statistical
significance)
• Test hypotheses from many angles

Insights begin to be generated at customer interviews. You
need a big enough dataset to discern patterns!
Number of Interviews (Time)

Customer Discovery ‘DO’s’
• More interviews is better than fewer interviews
• Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You will
struggle; you will have to get creative
• Focus on gaining insights into both corporate and
employee problems and needs
• Listen and observe
• Watch for patterns to emerge; be ready to iterate or
pivot accordingly

Customer Discovery ‘DO NOTs’
• DO NOT assume you already understand the
corporate and/or employee problems or needs
• DO NOT interview people you already know
• DO NOT avoid the hard truths (be ready to iterate or
pivot)
• DO NOT SELL!
• DO NOT abandon hope….

How do you ensure good data?
“Everything we hear
is an opinion not a
fact.
Everything we see is
a perspective not the
truth.”

Ensuring good data – avoiding bias
Anchoring bias - Depending too heavily on an initial piece of
information offered (the ‘anchor’) when making subsequent
judgments.
Confirmation bias - The tendency to search for, interpret,
favour, and recall information in a way that confirms or
supports one's prior beliefs or values.
Suggestibility bias - Being inclined to accept and act on the
suggestions of others.
Insensitivity to sample size - Judging the validity or
significance of information without consideration of sample
size.

Interview planning
• 100 interviews is a daunting number and requires
careful planning to achieve
• Break down into chunks of 15 per week
• 15 interviews completed during Orientation (by
February 5)
• 15/week for remainder of the program (February 5 –
March 26)

Interview cadence
By the end of: New interviews Total interviews
February 5, 2026 15 15
February 12, 2026 15 30
February 19, 2026 15 45
March 5, 2026 15 60
March 12, 2026 15 75
March 19, 2026 15 90
March 26, 2026 10 100

Interview planning
• Securing an interview can take weeks
• Don’t expect to reach out to 15 people and get
15 interviews. Typically for every 15 requests you
will get ~5 responses and confirm ~1 – 3
interviews (i.e. 10 – 20% conversion rate)

Interview planning
• You will need to make between 75 and 150 new
requests each week. This will vary depending on:
• How well you craft your message
• Your industry/market (some can be very diverse)
• Types of customers you are going after:
• Individuals
• Companies – 1 company does not equal 1 customer;
individuals within the company play different roles (end
user, buyer, decision-maker, etc.)

Customer interviews – getting started
1. Leverage your network (‘warm’ contacts)
• Who can your TL and mentor connect you with?
• Who can other L2M teams connect you with?
2. LinkedIn (try Professional, it’s worth it)
3. Web search (Corporate web sites, Industry
associations, etc.); alerts (Google, etc.); AI (Gemini
Deep Research, etc.)
4. As you progress:
• Who can your interviewees connect you with (referrals)?
• Who to contact in new segments/subsegments that you
uncover?

Customer interviews – tips and tricks
• Take advantage of the fact that you are a student or post-
doc
• Ask for insights and advice, not specifically an “interview”
• Plan your questions carefully, but be prepared to adapt to
your interviewee’s answers (have a ‘structured
conversation’)
• Penultimate question – “Is there anything you would like to
add?”
• Always ask for referrals before concluding the interview
• Use Airtable CRM and Business Model Canvas to keep track
of your findings

Bottom line
When in doubt – talk to your customers!

QUESTIONS?

In summary

Empowering success: BMC + Customer Discovery
Strategic Validation
Use the BMC to map assumptions and test them quickly with real
customers.
Risk Reduction
Iterate on evidence, not guesses, to avoid costly misalignment and waste.
Customer Alignment
Continuously refine value propositions to reflect real needs and jobs-to-be-
done.
Sustained Growth
Habitual customer discovery will keep you responsive to market trends.

Why is this important?
The right business model can
increase the value of your company
by 5X to 10X
