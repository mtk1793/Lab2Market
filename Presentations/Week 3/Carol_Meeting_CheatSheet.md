## 📊 METRICS (Report Immediately)

**Outreaches this week:** 179  
**Interviews completed this week:** 2  
**Conversion rate:** 1.12%  
**Performance Level:** Meeting the Bar ⭐⭐⭐

## 1️⃣ WHAT DID YOU UNCOVER?

**Uncovered:** Communication speed is THE universal pain point across all 5 segments (n=1 comprehensive interview)

**Evidence:**  
- Clients: *"We need information fast, not slow"*
- Facilities: *"Transparency with customer is essential"*
- Labs: *"Communication gap between"*
- OEMs: *"Lead time is a big deal"*
- Authorities: *"Miscommunication causes problems"*

**Pattern:** 100% of segments (5/5) cited communication/speed as #1 pain

**Contradiction:** OEMs already doing distributed manufacturing ("we have OEM partners"), not trying to "enable" it

**Surprise:** Right-fit matching > database size. *"Right customer with right problem and right budget"*

---

## 2️⃣ WHY DOES IT MATTER?

**Finding:** Communication is THE differentiator (not marketplace/search)

**Implication:** Customers struggle with SPEED, not supplier discovery

**Decision:** 
✅ **PIVOT:** From "Marketplace" to "Real-time Collaboration Platform"
✅ **BMC Change:** Value Prop = Communication infrastructure + Matching (not just directory)
✅ **Target Customer:** Companies MANAGING distributed mfg (not enabling it)

---

## 3️⃣ NEXT THING TO KNOW?

**Riskiest assumption:** Will manufacturers pay $10K-$25K/year subscription for speed?

**Hypothesis:** Yes, IF we reduce sourcing from 3-4 weeks to <1 week

**Test:** Interview 15 procurement managers with pricing mockup  
**Success threshold:** ≥8/15 (53%) say "reasonable given value"  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks (by Feb 10)

---

## 🔥 CRITICAL GAPS

❌ **ALL pricing untested** (H33-H36 = 0 validation)  
❌ **Channel strategy unknown** (H37-H38 = 0 validation)  
⚠️  **Labs underrepresented** (33% validation vs. 80%+ for others)

---

## ✅ WEEK 4 COMMITMENTS

**Interviews:** 15 (10 clients, 3 facilities, 2 labs)  
**Outreach:** 200+ contacts  
**Artifact:** Pricing mockup (3 tiers)  
**Test:** Pricing in EVERY interview

## 💬 COPY/PASTE FOR CAROL

*"Because we learned that communication speed is THE differentiator (not just database size), we will now: (1) Reposition platform as 'Real-time Collaboration for Distributed Manufacturing,' (2) Prioritize building communication infrastructure in MVP, (3) Lead all outreach with 'speed' and 'transparency.'"*

*"Next week we will test pricing sensitivity by interviewing 15 procurement managers with the pricing mockup, and success looks like ≥8/15 saying '$10K-$25K is reasonable given the time savings.'"*
