## THE THREE QUESTIONS

### 1️⃣ **What did you uncover this week?**

#### **Finding:**

**Uncovered:** Communication speed is THE universal pain point across all customer segments, valued more than any single feature. (Segments: Clients, Facilities, Labs, OEMs, Authorities; n=1 comprehensive multi-segment interview)

#### **Evidence:**

**From Bassey Amba (Enginuity) - Business Development Engineer:**

**Segment 1 (Clients/Manufacturers):**
> *"Communication - they still add value, we need information fast, not slow... Internal communication between us and supply chain management, waiting for documents."*

**Segment 2 (3D Printing Facilities):**
> *"For me, transparency and good communication with the customer is essential."*

**Segment 3 (Labs/Testing Authorities):**
> *"The most time-consuming thing is communication and gap between."*

**Segment 4 (OEMs):**
> *"Lead time is a big deal. If we can get the part faster, that would be great... Communication limits flexibility."*

**Segment 5 (Authorities/Regulatory):**
> *"Lack of transparency, communication gaps, miscommunication between the authorities, contractors, labs"*

**From Khashayar Morshed Behbahani (Dalhousie Lab Researcher):**
> *"Because of NDAs and confidentiality he can't share that much of information... most of the parts were general."*

This revealed a **secondary finding**: Labs are highly restricted by NDAs, making detailed customer discovery challenging. Most conversations stay surface-level.

#### **Pattern:**

**Consistent across ALL 5 segments:**
1. **Communication delays** are the #1 bottleneck
2. **Information waiting time** directly impacts project timelines
3. **Transparency** is valued higher than cost optimization
4. **Internal AND external** communication both problematic

**Specific pattern:**
- Manufacturers: "Waiting for documents" from supply chain
- Facilities: "Transparency with customer" needed
- Labs: "Communication gaps" cause delays
- OEMs: "Communication limits flexibility"
- Authorities: "Miscommunication" creates compliance problems

#### **Contradiction:**

**Surprising contradiction:**
- **Original hypothesis (H4, H16):** OEMs "want to enable" distributed manufacturing but are "blocked" by trust/quality issues
- **Reality:** OEMs are ALREADY actively using distributed manufacturing
  > *"We have a lot of OEM partners we can leverage"* - Bassey Amba

**Implication:** Market is MORE mature than assumed. They don't need "enablement" - they need "optimization."

#### **Surprise:**

**3 Major surprises that changed our thinking:**

1. **Communication > Cost**  
   We assumed customers would lead with "find me the cheapest supplier." Instead:
   > *"Lead time is a big deal"* and *"we need information fast"*
   
   Speed and communication trump cost.

2. **Right-fit matching > Database size**  
   > *"Right customer with right problem and right budget - that's the issue to find"*
   
   Not about having 1000 suppliers; about showing the RIGHT 3 suppliers.

3. **Labs are NDA-locked**  
   Our second interview (Khashayar) revealed labs can't share process details due to confidentiality. This limits the depth of customer discovery in Segment 3.

---

### 2️⃣ **Why does it matter?**

#### **Finding → Implication → Decision Chain**

**Finding:**  
Communication speed is THE universal pain across all 5 segments, mentioned 100% of the time (5/5 segments).

**Implication:**  
This affects our core assumption that our platform is primarily a "marketplace" (search/discovery tool).

**Reality:** Customers don't struggle to FIND suppliers (there are directories). They struggle to:
- Vet suppliers quickly (certification proof)
- Get responses fast (communication delays)
- Share information securely (design files, specs)
- Track project status (transparency)

**Decision we're making:**

✅ **PIVOT PLATFORM POSITIONING**

**From:** "Marketplace to find certified 3D printing suppliers"  
**To:** "Real-time collaboration platform for distributed 3D printing manufacturing"

**Concrete BMC Changes:**

| BMC Block | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Value Proposition** | "Search database of certified suppliers" | "Real-time communication + Certified supplier matching" |
| **Key Activities** | Supplier database curation | Communication infrastructure + Supplier vetting |
| **Key Resources** | Supplier directory | Real-time messaging platform + Document sharing + Status tracking |
| **Customer Relationships** | Self-service platform | Active collaboration hub |

---

#### **Second Finding → Implication → Decision**

**Finding:**  
OEMs already doing distributed manufacturing; market more mature than expected.

**Implication:**  
This affects our assumption about market readiness and competitive positioning.

**Our original pitch:** "Enable distributed manufacturing for the first time"  
**Reality:** They're already doing it through OEM partner networks and multiple suppliers

**Decision we're making:**

✅ **REFRAME TARGET CUSTOMER**

**From:** "Companies wanting to START distributed manufacturing"  
**To:** "Companies struggling to MANAGE existing distributed manufacturing networks"

**This changes:**
- **Customer Segment:** Not innovators/early adopters; early majority already doing distributed
- **Pain Intensity:** Higher (active pain) vs. theoretical future pain
- **Willingness to Pay:** Proven budget (they're ALREADY spending on this problem)
- **Competitive Alternative:** Not "DIY everything" but "messy Excel + email chaos"

---

#### **Third Finding → Implication → Decision**

**Finding:**  
Labs are NDA-restricted and can't share detailed process information.

**Implication:**  
This affects our customer discovery strategy for Segment 3 (Labs).

**Decision we're making:**

✅ **ADJUST INTERVIEW APPROACH FOR LABS**

- Focus on process-level questions (NOT proprietary client details)
- Ask about general workflow, NOT specific projects
- Target lab managers/administrators (NOT project engineers doing confidential work)
- Validate through observation of public case studies/certifications

---

### 3️⃣ **What is the next thing you need to know?**

#### **Riskiest Assumption to Test:**

**Next question:**  
Will manufacturers pay a PREMIUM (10-20% higher than commission-free alternatives) for a platform that prioritizes communication speed + quality matching over lowest-price suppliers?

#### **Hypothesis:**

Manufacturers (CS.1) will pay subscription fees of $10K-$25K/year for access to a pre-vetted network with real-time communication IF it reduces sourcing time from 3-4 weeks to <1 week and eliminates vendor vetting overhead.

**Why this is the RISKIEST assumption:**

1. **Revenue Model Untested:** ALL 4 revenue stream hypotheses (H33-H36) have ZERO validation (0 interviews tested pricing)
2. **Willingness to Pay Unknown:** We know the PAIN exists, but not if they'll pay OUR price
3. **Budget Owner Unclear:** Who controls the budget for this? Procurement? Engineering? Supply Chain?
4. **Build vs. Decision:** If they won't pay our price, the entire business model collapses (we can't build a sustainable platform on commission-only from suppliers)

#### **Test Plan:**

**Who:** 15 procurement managers / supply chain directors at manufacturers

**Target profile:**
- Companies with monthly 3D printing needs ($50K+/year spend)
- Currently using 3+ different suppliers
- Pain: Lead time delays causing project timeline impacts

**How:**

**Interview Script Addition:**
1. **Set baseline:** "How much do you currently spend on 3D printing annually?" → Establishes budget range
2. **Quantify pain:** "What's the cost (time + money) of your current 3-4 week sourcing process?" → Anchors value
3. **Test willingness:** "If a platform could reduce that to <1 week with certified, pre-vetted suppliers, what would that be worth to you?" → Open-ended WTP
4. **Anchor pricing:** "Would a $15K/year subscription be reasonable given those time savings?" → Test specific price point
5. **Identify budget owner:** "Who would approve a purchase like this at your company?" → Decision process

**Artifact to test:**
- Simple pricing page mockup showing 3 tiers:
  - Basic: $10K/year (search + messaging)
  - Pro: $20K/year (priority matching + forecasting)
  - Enterprise: $50K/year (white-label + API)

**Success threshold:**
- **Strong validation:** ≥8/15 (53%) say "$10K-$25K is reasonable given value"
- **Moderate validation:** ≥5/15 (33%) say "would need board approval but feasible"
- **Pivot required:** <5/15 (33%) → Need to revisit pricing or revenue model

**Test timeline:** Next 2 weeks (by Feb 10, 2026)

## SECONDARY RISKIEST ASSUMPTIONS (After Pricing)

### 2. Channel Strategy (H37-H38)

**Question:** How do manufacturers currently discover new sourcing solutions?

**Hypothesis:** Trade shows (RAPID, Formnext) and thought leadership content (LinkedIn, whitepapers) drive 60%+ of qualified leads.

**Test:** Ask all 15 interviewees: "How did you find your current 3D printing suppliers? If you were looking for a new solution, where would you start?"

**Success threshold:** ≥60% mention conferences OR online research (validates current channel strategy)

### 3. Certification Body Decision Support (H44)

**Question:** Is certification body selection actually a high-stakes pain point worth building a decision support tool for?

**Hypothesis:** Manufacturers lose $50K+ and 2-4 months per product launch due to wrong certification body choices.

**Test:** Ask: "Walk me through the last time you needed certification. How did you choose which body to use? What would have made that easier?"

**Success threshold:** ≥8/15 describe this as "painful" or "costly mistake" → Build the feature. <5/15 → Nice-to-have, not MVP.

## WHAT "EXCELLENT" LOOKS LIKE FOR NEXT WEEK

**By end of 20 minutes with Carol, I should be able to say:**

✅ *"Because we learned that communication speed is THE differentiator (not just database size), we will now:*
1. *Reposition platform as 'Real-time Collaboration for Distributed Manufacturing'*
2. *Prioritize building communication infrastructure (messaging, document sharing, status tracking) in MVP*
3. *Lead all outreach messaging with 'speed' and 'transparency' not 'marketplace'*

✅ *"Next week we will test pricing sensitivity by interviewing 15 procurement managers with the pricing mockup artifact, and success looks like ≥8/15 saying '$10K-$25K is reasonable given the time savings.'"*

---

## COPY/PASTE RESPONSE TEMPLATE (FILLED)

**Uncovered:** Communication speed is THE universal pain point. (Segment: All 5 segments, n=1 comprehensive interview). 

**Evidence:** *"We need information fast, not slow"* (Manufacturers). *"Transparency and good communication with customer is essential"* (Facilities). *"Communication gap between"* (Labs). *"Lead time is a big deal"* (OEMs). *"Miscommunication between authorities"* (Regulatory). 

**Pattern:** 100% of segments (5/5) cited communication/speed as top pain. 

**Contradiction:** OEMs already doing distributed manufacturing ("we have a lot of OEM partners"), not trying to "enable" it. 

**Surprise:** Right-fit matching > database size. "Right customer with right problem and right budget - that's the issue."

**Why it matters:** This affects our assumption that we're a "marketplace" (search tool). 

**Implication:** Customers struggle with COMMUNICATION speed, not supplier discovery. 

**Decision:** Pivot positioning from "Marketplace" to "Real-time Collaboration Platform." Rebuild MVP to prioritize messaging infrastructure.

**Next thing to know:** 

**Riskiest assumption:** Will manufacturers pay premium ($10K-$25K/year subscription) for speed over lowest-price alternatives? 

**Hypothesis:** Yes, IF we reduce sourcing from 3-4 weeks to <1 week. 

**Test + threshold:** Interview 15 procurement managers with pricing mockup. Success = ≥8/15 (53%) say price is reasonable given value. Timeline: 2 weeks.

## QUESTIONS FOR CAROL

1. **On Pricing Test:** Should we test commission model with facilities simultaneously, or sequence it after manufacturer subscription validation?

2. **On NDA Challenge:** How do we get deeper insights from labs when NDAs restrict detailed sharing? Alternative approaches?

3. **On Platform Pivot:** Given communication is THE differentiator, should we consider partnering with existing collaboration tools (Slack, Teams) rather than building from scratch?

4. **On Market Maturity:** If OEMs are already doing distributed manufacturing, does this validate product-market fit faster, or does it mean we face entrenched competitors?
