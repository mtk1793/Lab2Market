## SLIDE 4: Question 1 - What Did You Uncover This Week?

**Layout:** Question header + Finding box

**Content:**

### **THE QUESTION:**
> "What did you uncover this week?"

### **THE FINDING:**

**We learned that certification—not business case, not technology—is THE primary barrier to AM adoption in oil & gas and defense sectors** (Segment: Industry operators + academic experts, n=4)

**Evidence:**
- **Dr. Ali Nasiri** (Dalhousie, oil & gas expert): *"AM developed so fast that authorities couldn't catch up. Even if AM could give them lots of opportunities, that certification alone causes lots of issues so they don't like that process."*
  
- **Jordan Cumming** (Enginuity, ocean tech): On temporary AM parts: *"Is it certified against marine grade corrosion? Because it's technically not from a known source, there's also a liability issue. It's a bit of a gray area."*

- **Mark Kirby** (Tronosjet/Canada Makes): *"Certification is a significant barrier because we keep regarding additive as a novel process... extra layers come with cost and time burden."*

**Pattern:**
All 4 industry-focused interviews (Nasiri, Kirby, Cum ming, Power) mentioned certification BEFORE cost or business case. Regulators (DNV, Lloyd's Register, ASTM) developing standards but "too general, not component-specific."

**Contradiction:**
Aerospace has solved this (Tronosjet certified laser part = can reproduce without re-certifying). But oil & gas/maritime won't invest in certification for 1-5 parts/year (not mass production).

**Surprise:**
The barrier isn't "is AM technically viable?" (everyone agrees it works). It's "can we certify it fast enough to justify 1-off production?" This flips our assumption that business case was #1 barrier.

**Design Notes:**
- Large quote box for Dr. Nasiri quote (most impactful)
- Color-coded evidence (Academic = blue, Industry = green)
- "Surprise" section in highlighted box

## SLIDE 5: Pattern Deep Dive - Certification Framework

**Layout:** Process flow diagram

**Content:**

### **What Must Be Certified (Per Dr. Nasiri):**

```
┌─────────────┐
│   THE PART  │ → Materials testing, structural validation
└─────────────┘

┌─────────────┐
│ THE OPERATOR│ → Personnel qualification
└─────────────┘

┌─────────────┐
│ THE POWDER  │ → Batch consistency, traceability
└─────────────┘

┌─────────────┐
│ THE PROCESS │ → Machine calibration, temperature, speed
└─────────────┘

┌─────────────┐
│  THE LABS   │ → Third-party validation facility accreditation
└─────────────┘
```

**Current Certification Process:**
1. AM facility produces part
2. Contact registry (DNV, Lloyd's Register, ASTM)
3. Hire them as subcontractor
4. They provide "pathway" (not standardized!)
5. Step-by-step validation using accredited labs
6. **Part-by-part certification** (no template reuse)

**Result:** "Costly and time demanding" → Oil & gas avoids AM

**Design Notes:**
- Flow diagram showing 5 certification requirements
- Red "bottleneck" indicator on step-by-step process
- Visual showing cost/time accumulation

## SLIDE 6: Question 2 - Why Does It Matter?

**Layout:** Chain diagram (Finding → Implication → Decision)

**Content:**

### **THE QUESTION:**
> "Why does it matter? How does this change a decision about your business model canvas?"

### **THE CHAIN:**

**Finding:**  
Certification (not business case) is primary adoption barrier for non-mass-production applications (oil & gas 1-5 parts/year)

↓

**Implication:**  
Our platform can't just connect OEMs → AM facilities and claim "digital inventory solves lead time." If parts aren't pre-certified, customers won't order them regardless of speed/cost benefits. **Adoption friction = certification pathway, not discovery/connection.**

↓

**Decision We're Making:**

**PIVOT VALUE PROPOSITION:**

❌ **OLD:** "Digital inventory platform connecting OEMs to AM facilities for faster part delivery"

✅ **NEW:** "Pre-certified parts library + certification pathway accelerator"

**Business Model Canvas Changes:**

| Canvas Element | Old | New |
|----------------|-----|-----|
| **Value Proposition** | Speed (reduce lead time) | **Certification risk reduction** |
| **Key Activities** | Marketplace matching | **Pre-certification database + pathway templates** |
| **Revenue Model** | Transaction fees (% of order) | **Certification tracking SaaS + first-customer subsidies** |
| **Key Partners** | AM facilities only | **+ DNV, Lloyd's Register, ASTM (regulators)** |
| **Customer Segments** | All offshore operators | **Focus: Repeat part users (justify cert cost)** |

**Design Notes:**
- Large arrows showing causality (Finding → Implication → Decision)
- Before/after comparison table (OLD vs NEW clearly marked)
- Highlight NEW in green

## SLIDE 7: Supporting Evidence - Equinor & ExxonMobil Validation

**Layout:** Competitive intelligence box

**Content:**

### **MARKET VALIDATION:**

**Dr. Nasiri revealed:**
> "Equinor did the same thing recently a few years ago and asked **Siemens as the subcontractor** to do the same for them. The digital inventory concept was there at least for their own work. **Equinor and ExxonMobil were two big names who entered the AM and digital inventory** in oil and gas industry."

**What This Means:**
- Two oil & gas majors already pursuing digital inventory
- Multi-year Siemens project (enterprise-level investment)
- **Problem validated at highest level**

**Strategic Implication:**
- We're not "creating" a market (market exists!)
- Opportunity: Better solution than Siemens enterprise offering
- Gap: SME-accessible version (Siemens = $$$)

**Platform Model Confirmed:**
> "They don't want to directly enter the AM yet they prefer to be connected with the concept and connect with other 3D printing facilities. They prefer to be connected to local facilities to not always ship parts from Europe or Norway."

**Design Notes:**
- Large company logos (Equinor, ExxonMobil, Siemens)
- "Market Validated" badge/stamp
- Quote box for platform model confirmation

## SLIDE 8: Supporting Evidence - Canadian Navy Program

**Layout:** Partnership opportunity visual

**Content:**

### **SECOND MAJOR MARKET DISCOVERED:**

**Jordan Cumming (Enginuity) revealed:**
> "The Cove over in Dartmouth partnered with **Thales who supports the Arctic Patrol Vessel program with the Canadian Navy**. They joined Cove on a challenge program. And one of them was **additive manufacturing**... Part of it is the **digital library of parts**."

**Program Details:**
- **Participants:** Thales (Navy contractor) + The Cove (innovation hub)
- **Focus:** "Additive manufacturing and exotic materials or 3D printing of metals and plastics"
- **Model:** "Similar to Lab2Market, just a slightly different angle"
- **Status:** "Beginning of challenge" = early stage learnings available
- **Key Component:** **"Digital library of parts"** ← OUR EXACT CONCEPT

**Markets Identified:**

| Market | Validation Source | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **Oil & Gas** | Equinor/ExxonMobil (Nasiri) | Active (Siemens project) |
| **Defense/Navy** | Canadian Navy (Cumming) | Active (Thales/Cove challenge) |

**Next Steps:**
- Interview Thales contact (Jordan providing intro)
- Learn from Navy pilot challenges
- Explore defense certification pathway (easier than oil & gas?)

**Design Notes:**
- Split screen: Oil & Gas (left) + Defense (right)
- Logos: Thales, Cove, Canadian Navy
- "Partnership Opportunity" callout

## SLIDE 9: Structural vs Non-Structural Framework

**Layout:** Decision tree diagram

**Content:**

### **ADOPTION PATHWAY IDENTIFIED:**

**Finding (Consistent across 3 interviews):**

**Dr. Nasiri:**
> "Focusing too much on structural parts could be challenging and time consuming. It would be better to focus on **non-structural and less risky**. The part should be in **non-critical and non-simple manufacturing**."

**Jordan Cumming:**
> "I would say it would be **less on the structural and more on components that support subsystems** on a vessel... piping infrastructure, valves, piping joints."

**Mark Kirby:**
> "There is nothing I have ever printed in metal that did not require machining... If it was a great solution for **5% of the inventory problem**, that's still worth solving. But you have to be good at **what is the right 5%**."

### **THE FRAMEWORK:**

```
                    AM ADOPTION DECISION TREE
                              │

```

**Entry Point:** Non-structural + Non-critical + Complex geometry = "Right 5%"

**Examples:**
- ✅ Fresh water piping valves (Jordan)
- ✅ ROV hydraulic fittings (Jord an)
- ✅ Obsolete pump components (Hopkins mentor)
- ❌ Engine pistons (Mark: require machining anyway)

## SLIDE 10: Hypothesis Updates - Rejected & Validated

**Layout:** Two-column comparison

**Content:**

### **❌ HYPOTHESIS REJECTED:**

**NH.9 - "AM Enables Digital Inventory"**

**Original Hypothesis:** Additive manufacturing uniquely enables digital inventory because parts can be printed on-demand from CAD files, unlike traditional manufacturing.

**Mark Kirby's Challenge:**
> "I'm not convinced that additive enables digital inventory. In fact, I don't think that it does. There is nothing I have ever printed in metal that did not require machining. So why didn't I just take a block and machine it from solid? **If I wanna send a model anywhere in the world and have something made, I could do that 10 years ago** [with CNC]."

**Status:** AM does NOT uniquely enable digital inventory. **CNC + email already did this 10+ years ago.**

**Revised Understanding:**  
Digital inventory ≠ AM-specific. It's enabled by:
- CAD models (format-agnostic)
- Digital communication (email, cloud)
- Manufacturing on demand (**CNC, AM, or other**)

**Implication:** Stop positioning AM as unique enabler. Position as **"one manufacturing option in digital inventory ecosystem."**

---

### **✅ HYPOTHESES VALIDATED:**

**NH.7 - Certification is THE Gatekeeper (UPGRADED STATUS)**

**Evidence:**
- All 4 industry interviews mentioned certification first
- Oil & gas avoids AM specifically due to certification (not cost)
- "AM developed so fast authorities couldn't catch up"

**Status:** ❌ Changed from "A barrier" → ✅ **"THE PRIMARY BARRIER"**

---

**NH.4 - Geographic Isolation Drives Adoption**

**Evidence:**
- Jordan: Offshore vessels "every second counts... or else it's money lost"
- Dr. Nasiri: Remote communities + urgent scenarios enable adoption
- Hopkins: Newfoundland cargo jet delays = AM opportunity

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED** (Offshore > Remote communities for urgency)

---

**NH.2 - Obsolete/Specialized Parts**

**Evidence:**
- Jordan: "Specialized parts, no readily available spares"
- Hopkins: "15-year-old pump" example
- Mark: Aerospace certified obsolete designs

**Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED**

**Design Notes:**
- Clear RED (rejected) vs GREEN (validated) visual separation
- Quote highlighting for key evidence
- Status badges (REJECTED, VALIDATED, UPGRADED)

## SLIDE 11: New Hypotheses Generated (This Week)

**Layout:** Hypothesis cards

**Content:**

### **🆕 NEW HYPOTHESES TO TEST:**

---

#### **H60 - Pre-Certified Parts Library**

**Hypothesis:**  
AM adoption is hindered by lack of reusable certifications. A platform that catalogs pre-certified AM part designs (with certificate numbers, materials, facilities qualified to produce them) would dramatically lower adoption barriers for subsequent customers.

**Evidence:**
- Dr. Nasiri: Tronosjet certified laser part = "can reproduce without re-certifying"
- Aerospace already doing this
- First customer pays cert cost, subsequent customers order pre-certified design

**Test:**
- Interview Tronosjet (Mark Kirby's company): How did they certify? Cost? Timeline?
- Build prototype: Database of pre-certified offshore parts
- **Success threshold:** 3+ facilities willing to share cert docs + 5+ OEMs expressing interest

---

#### **H63 - Offshore Inventory Depletion Monitoring**

**Hypothesis:**  
Offshore assets (ROVs, vessels, oil rigs) experience surprise spare parts stockouts due to lack of real-time inventory tracking, leading to emergency downtime. A platform that monitors part depletion, predicts stockouts, and provides digital AM alternatives would reduce unplanned downtime.

**Evidence:**
- Jordan: "Sooner or later you're gonna run out of something" (ROV spare parts)
- No existing tracking system mentioned
- High consequence: "System down, every second counts"

**Test:**
- Interview 5+ offshore operators: How often do stockouts occur?
- Survey: Do you have real-time spare parts tracking?
- **Success threshold:** 60%+ report stockouts as pain point + no existing solution

---

#### **H64 - Temporary AM Parts for Non-Critical Applications**

**Hypothesis:**  
Offshore operators would accept "temporary" AM parts for non-critical systems if it avoids catastrophic downtime, even with lower certification standards than permanent OEM parts.

**Evidence:**
- Jordan: "Concept has value depending on application"
- Current practice: "MacGyver engineering" (already improvising)
- Trade-off: Some risk vs definite $1M/day downtime

**Challenges:**
- Performance uncertainty
- Liability concerns
- "Gray area" legally

**Test:**
- **Pilot project:** Low-risk part (Swayze lock fittings), measure performance
- Legal framework: Temporary part waivers
- **Success threshold:** Part performs ≥80% as well as OEM, downtime reduced by ≥50%

---

#### **H65 - Defense Sector Digital Inventory**

**Hypothesis:**  
Canadian Navy vessel operations face same digital inventory challenges as commercial offshore and would adopt platform proven in commercial sector.

**Evidence:**
- Thales + Cove actively working on this
- Arctic Patrol Vessels = similar to oil & gas vessels

**Test:**
- Interview Thales contact
- Compare: Commercial vs Defense certification pathways
- **Success threshold:** Navy procurement process ≤2x harder than commercial

**Design Notes:**
- Each hypothesis as a card with colored border
- Evidence bullets (concise)
- Clear "Test" section with success thresholds

---

## SLIDE 12: Question 3 - What's Next to Know?

**Layout:** Question header + Risk matrix

**Content:**

### **THE QUESTION:**
> "What is the next thing you need to know? (Your riskiest assumption)"

### **RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:**

**Assumption:**  
OEMs (offshore operators, Navy) will PAY for pre-certified parts library access and certification pathway tracking, even if individual part costs are higher than traditional procurement.

**Why This is Risky:**
- We've validated PROBLEM (certification barrier)
- We've validated SOLUTION concept (pre-cert library)
- We have NOT validated WILLINGNESS TO PAY
- Oil & gas already has procurement inertia (Dr. Nasiri: "They prefer conventional")

---

### **TESTABLE FORMAT:**

**Next Question:**  
Would offshore operators/Navy pay $X,000/year for pre-certified parts library access if it reduces certification time from 12 months → 3 months?

**Hypothesis:**  
Operators will pay platform subscription fees if:
1. ≥20 pre-certified parts available in their inventory category
2. Certification timeline reduced by ≥50%
3. First-customer cost-sharing model exists (split cert cost across early adopters)

**Test Plan:**

| Who | How Many | Artifact | Success Threshold |
|-----|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Offshore operators** (Equinor, Cenovus, BP Canada) | n=10 interviews | Mockup: Pre-cert library dashboard + pricing tiers | ≥6/10 say "yes, would pay" at $5K-$15K/year tier |
| **Navy procurement** (Thales, Aaron Plamondon @ Irving) | n=3 interviews | Case study: Aerospace pre-cert model (how Tronosjet did it) | ≥2/3 confirm defense would adopt proven commercial model |
| **AM facilities** | n=5 | Revenue-sharing proposal (facility uploads cert docs, gets 20% of subscription fee) | ≥4/5 willing to share cert documentation |

**Next Week Actions:**
1. Build mockup dashboard (pre-cert parts library UI)
2. Create pricing tier structure ($5K / $15K / $50K annual tiers)
3. Schedule 10 interviews with offshore procurement teams
4. Interview Thales contact (re: Navy willingness to pay)

**Design Notes:**
- Risk matrix showing assumption placement (high impact, high uncertainty)
- Test plan as clear table
- Visual mockup preview (screenshot or wireframe)

# ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR AI SLIDE GENERATION:

## **Design Principles:**
1. **Professional but engaging:** Lab2Market is entrepreneurial, not corporate
2. **Data-driven:** Show evidence, quotes, numbers
3. **Visual hierarchy:** Key findings should jump out
4. **Color coding:** Consistent colors for segments (Navy = blue, Oil & Gas = green, Research = purple)
5. **Minimal text:** Slides are talking points, not documents

## **Typography:**
- **Headers:** Bold, 32-36pt
- **Body:** 18-24pt (readable from distance)
- **Quotes:** Italicized, 20-22pt, indented
- **Numbers:** Extra bold, 48-72pt for key metrics

## **Visual Elements:**
- Flow diagrams for processes
- Decision trees for frameworks
- Before/After comparisons for pivots
- Tables for data (but keep concise)
- Pie charts for distribution
- Progress bars for metrics

## **Brand Colors (Suggested):**
- **Primary:** Navy blue (#003D82) - professionalism
- **Secondary:** Green (#00A651) - validation/success
- **Accent:** Orange (#FF6900) - urgency/action
- **Neutral:** Gray (#6C757D) - supporting text

## **Quotes Formatting:**
- Use blockquote styling (gray background box)
- Include speaker name + title below quote
- Keep quotes to 2-3 sentences max

## **Data Visualization Priority:**
1. Slide 2: Performance ladder (custom graphic)
2. Slide 3: Pie chart (segment distribution)
3. Slide 5: Flow diagram (certification process)
