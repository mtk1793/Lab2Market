## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS PRESENTED

### **1. PRIMARY BARRIER IDENTIFIED: CERTIFICATION**

**Major Discovery:**
- **Initial assumption:** Business case and technology were top barriers
- **Actual finding:** **Certification is THE primary barrier to AM adoption**

**Evidence Sources:**
- **Mark Kirby** (Tronosjet/Canada Makes): "Certification is a significant barrier because we keep regarding additive as a novel process... extra layers come with cost and time burden"
- **Dr. Ali Nasiri** (Dalhousie University): Certification required for:
  - The part (materials testing, structural validation)
  - The operator (personnel qualification)
  - The powder (batch consistency, traceability)
  - The process (machine calibration, temperature, speed)
  - The labs (third-party validation facility accreditation)
- **John Lidstone & Sean Morgan** (Atlantic Excel): Working on AM but certification takes significant time
- **Jordan Cumming** (Enginuity): Certification concerns for marine-grade corrosion, liability issues

**Carol's Question:**
> "Who is saying certification is a barrier - the people doing additive or the people buying additive?"

**Your Response:**
- Mix of segments: Mark Kirby (digital inventory expert), Jordan (ocean tech), Dr. Nasiri (academic/expert), Noble Corporation buyer
- All work with buyers, making their insights valuable
- Noble Corporation buyer: AM "doesn't make sense that much for us" - prefers traditional physical inventory

### **2. STRATEGIC PIVOT ANNOUNCED**

#### **Value Proposition Change:**

| Aspect | OLD | NEW |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Primary Focus** | Speed & lead time reduction | **Certification risk reduction** |
| **Key Activities** | Marketplace matching | **Pre-certified parts database + pathway templates** |
| **Revenue Model** | Transaction fees | **Certification tracking SaaS** |
| **Partnerships** | AM facilities only | **+ Lloyd's Register, DNV, ASTM (regulators)** |

#### **Priority Shift:**

**Before:**
1. Additive Manufacturing (top priority)
2. Digital Inventory
3. AI

**After:**
1. **Digital Inventory** (top priority)
2. **AI**
3. Additive Manufacturing

**Rationale:**
- Customers love digital inventory concept more than pure AM
- Multiple people suggested AI integration
- AM is the means, not the end (digital inventory is the end)

---

### **3. MARKET VALIDATION - MAJOR PLAYERS**

**Discovery:** Equinor, ExxonMobil, and Siemens digital inventory projects

**Details:**
- **Equinor** and **ExxonMobil** implemented digital inventory platforms "a couple of years back"
- **Siemens** served as subcontractor for these projects
- Projects are confidential, requiring more research
- **Strategic Implication:** Problem validated at highest level (oil & gas majors)

---

### **4. NEW MARKET DISCOVERED: DEFENSE**

**Opportunity:** Canadian Navy / Shipbuilding

**Source:** Jordan Cumming revelation about **Thales** partnership with **The Cove**
- Working on defense systems and ships
- Focus on Arctic Patrol Vessel program
- Digital library of parts for Canadian Navy
- Meeting scheduled in ~2 weeks with Thales contact

**Strategic Value:**
- Diversification beyond oil & gas
- Canada-based focus (local innovation)
- Defense procurement = different buying process (potentially easier?)

---

### **5. FRAMEWORK: STRUCTURAL VS NON-STRUCTURAL**

**Adopted Framework:**

```
Focus on: Non-Structural + Non-Critical + Complex Parts
```

**Reasoning:**
- "You cannot say I'm going to have all of the parts and make additive manufacturing"
- Must categorize and prioritize
- Trust in AM "is not that high" across industries
- **Dr. Nasiri quote:** *"Additive manufacturing in research had a great advance, but in practice not that much. Main reason is regulations."*

**Entry Point Strategy:**
- Start with non-structural, non-critical parts
- Build trust and validation
- Graduate to more critical applications over time

## 💬 CAROL'S FEEDBACK & CRITICAL QUESTIONS

### **Questions to Answer (Assigned Homework):**

Carol emphasized focusing on these core questions:

1. **What is the problem you're trying to solve in the market?**
   - Be specific about the pain point

2. **Who has that problem?**
   - Identify exact customer segment

3. **How are they solving it now?**
   - Current workarounds, alternatives, status quo

4. **How much is it costing them to solve it?**
   - Quantify current solution cost (time, money, downtime)

5. **If they could fix anything, what would it be?**
   - Faster? Cheaper? Better?
   - **What is your competitive advantage?**

6. **Who is willing to pay you?**
   - Identify buyer persona

7. **Where's the money coming from?**
   - Revenue source, budget allocation

8. **Is the end user the same as the buyer?**
   - Understand decision-making unit

### **Carol's Overall Assessment:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- "Excellent job"
- "Really good understanding of the people involved"
- Good grasp of "barriers of entry"

⚠️ **Areas to Develop:**
- **Focus more on:** Problem definition, buyer identification, cost/benefit analysis
- **Need to answer:** "Where's the money coming from?"
- **Critical shift:** Move from understanding barriers → understanding customer value & willingness to pay

### **Carol's Advice:**

1. **Keep up outreaches:** Pace is good but can improve (3 team members ahead)
2. **Look outside Atlantic Canada:** Not confined to local market
3. **Find the benefit:** "How much of a benefit is this going to be to them?"
4. **Find the right people:** Those who will gain most from your solution = easier to push forward
