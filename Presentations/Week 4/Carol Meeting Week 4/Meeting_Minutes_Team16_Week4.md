## Things Learned

### **Key Discovery: Certification is THE Primary Barrier**
- Initial assumption was business case or technology
- **Everyone mentioned certification first:** Mark Kirby, Dr. Ali Nasiri, Jordan Cumming, Atlantic Excel team, Noble Corporation
- 5-part certification required: Part, Operator, Powder, Process, Labs
- This trumps business case and technology maturity

### **Strategic Pivot Validated**
- **Old priorities:** AM → Digital Inventory → AI
- **New priorities:** Digital Inventory → AI → AM
- Customers love digital inventory concept MORE than pure AM
- Multiple experts recommended AI integration

### **Market Validation: Major Players Already Doing This**
- **Equinor + ExxonMobil** built digital inventory platforms (Siemens as subcontractor)
- Problem validated at highest level (oil & gas majors)
- Confidential projects, need more research

### **New Market Discovered: Defense/Navy**
- **Thales** partnering with **The Cove** on Canadian Navy digital library
- Arctic Patrol Vessel program
- Meeting scheduled in ~2 weeks
- Canada-based opportunity (diversification from oil & gas)

### **Framework Adopted: Non-Structural Entry Point**
- Cannot target "all parts" - must categorize
- **Focus:** Non-structural + Non-critical + Complex geometry
- Quote from Dr. Nasiri: *"AM in research had great advance, but in practice not that much. Main reason is regulations."*

## Carol's Critical Questions (Homework for Next Week)

### **Ask Uncomfortable Questions About Cost & Value:**
1. **What problem are you solving?** (Be specific about pain point)
2. **Who has that problem?** (Exact customer segment)
3. **How are they solving it today?** (Current workarounds, alternatives)
4. **How much are they paying to solve it today?** (Quantify: downtime costs, procurement delays, inventory carrying costs)
5. **What is the minimum they are doing to solve it today?** (Baseline solution)
6. **Can I do it faster/higher quality/cheaper?** (Pick competitive advantage)
7. **Who is willing to pay you?** (Buyer persona identification)
8. **Where's the money coming from?** (Revenue source, budget authority)
9. **Is the end user the same as the buyer?** (Decision-making unit mapping)

### **Note to Self:**
> "At some point I'm gonna be asking where's the money coming from." — Carol

> "How much of a benefit is this going to be to them? That's really what I'm looking for." — Carol

**Reminder:** Dig deeper when asking interview questions. Do not stop at the initial "why". **Who is really paying to solve this problem?**

## Things for Next Week

### **Immediate Actions (Feb 4):**
- ✅ Execute 6 scheduled interviews tomorrow
- ✅ Convert 12 pending interviews to completions

### **Customer Value Quantification:**
- Ask offshore operators: "How much does downtime cost per day?" (millions?)
- Ask procurement teams: "How long are current lead times? What's the delay cost?"
- Ask inventory managers: "What's your carrying cost for $50M physical inventory?"
- Measure certification timeline: "12 months to certify one part = how much lost opportunity?"

### **Regulatory Engagement:**
- Contact **Lloyd's Register**
- Contact **DNV**
- Contact **ASTM**
- Question: "How do you help innovators convince buyers?"

### **Competitive Intelligence:**
- Research Equinor-Siemens partnership (find public docs)
- Research ExxonMobil digital inventory implementation
- Identify gaps in enterprise solutions (where can we beat Siemens?)

### **Defense Market Development:**
- Prepare for Thales meeting (~Feb 17-20)
- Research Canadian Navy Arctic Patrol Vessel program
- Understand defense vs commercial certification pathways

### **Geographic Expansion:**
- Look outside Atlantic Canada
- Target European operators (OMV interview Feb 4)
- Canadian operators in Alberta, BC

### **Define Competitive Advantage:**
- Choose ONE: Faster? Cheaper? Better?
- Test positioning with next 12 interviews
- Validate against Siemens/enterprise offerings

### **Target Contacts:**
- **Thales** (defense digital library) - Meeting scheduled
- **OMV** (European oil & gas) - Interview Feb 4
- **NGen** (AI for manufacturing) - Interview Feb 4
- **Baker Hughes** (AM leader) - Interview Feb 4
- **Lloyd's Register, DNV, ASTM** (regulators) - Need to schedule
- **Precise Design** (local AM manufacturer) - Jordan referral
- **Kraken Robotics** (ocean tech) - Third priority

## Reminder for Self

### **Shift Focus From Barriers → Value:**
- ✅ We know certification is a barrier (validated!)
- ❌ We don't yet know: How much will customers PAY to solve it?
- ❌ We don't yet know: Who has budget authority to buy our solution?
- ❌ We don't yet know: What's the quantified benefit? ($X saved per year?)

### **Carol's Message:**
> "Find the people you're trying to push this forward with... how much of a benefit is this going to be to them? Then we can maybe find the people a little bit easier."

### **Key Mindset Shift:**
- **OLD:** "Certification is a problem, we should solve it"
- **NEW:** "Customers are losing $X/year due to certification delays. They'll pay $Y to solve it. Here's proof."

## Week 5 Goals

**Interview Target:** Move from 4th → 1st place in team (need 10-14 interviews)  
**Conversion Rate:** Improve outreach → interview conversion  
**Quantification:** Get specific $$ data on customer costs & willingness to pay  
**Market Validation:** Execute defense sector interview (Thales)  
**Competitive Positioning:** Define faster/cheaper/better advantage vs Siemens

**Status:** ✅ On track with clear direction for improvement  
**Carol's Assessment:** "Excellent job" + "Doing pretty good"
