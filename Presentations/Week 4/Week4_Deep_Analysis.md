# Week 4: Mid-Program Report - Deep Analysis & Key Learnings

**Program:** Lab2Market  
**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Facilitator:** Carol Bartlett, MSc.  
**Analysis By:** Mahmoud Kiasari

---

## Executive Summary

Week 4 represents a **critical inflection point** in the Lab2Market journey—the transition from exploration to validation. This week synthesizes learnings from initial customer discovery interviews and introduces the **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)** framework as the lens through which to interpret customer behavior. The key insight: **customers don't optimize for "better"—they optimize for less pain, less disruption, and fastest relief.**

---

## 🎯 Core Framework: Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

### The Fundamental Paradigm Shift

![Jobs-to-be-Done Framework](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/jobs_to_be_done_framework_1769738609534.png)

**Core Principle:** People don't buy products—they "hire" solutions to get a job done.

### Three Pillars of JTBD

1. **Products vs. Solutions**
   - ❌ **Wrong thinking:** "Customers buy our product because it's better"
   - ✅ **Right thinking:** "Customers hire our solution to achieve a specific outcome"

2. **The Job is the Outcome, Not the Product**
   - Focus on WHAT customers are trying to accomplish, not HOW they do it today
   - Example: People don't want a drill; they want a hole in the wall

3. **Understanding the Job Builds Better Solutions**
   - Deep customer insight → User needs → Better product design
   - Surfaces hidden pain points competitors miss

## 💡 The Irrational Market Paradox

### Why Markets Seem Irrational (But Aren't)

![Customer Optimization Framework](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/customer_optimization_framework_1769738591031.png)

**The Disconnect:**

| What WE Think Customers Want | What Customers ACTUALLY Want |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Best solution | **Least disruption** |
| Best product | **Least risk** |
| Best architecture | **Least effort** |
| Best long-term outcome | **Lowest visible cost** |
| | **Fastest relief** |
| | **Cognitive simplicity** |

### Deep Insight for AddManuChain

**Implication:** Your platform cannot succeed by being "the best" additive manufacturing marketplace. It must succeed by being:
- **Least disruptive** to current procurement workflows
- **Lowest risk** (quality guarantees, certifications)
- **Least effort** (automated matching, not manual search)
- **Fastest relief** (quick supplier discovery, not weeks of vetting)
- **Cognitively simple** (clear decisions, not overwhelming options)

**Actionable Strategy:**
- ✅ **DO:** Frame AddManuChain as "making procurement easier" (relief from pain)
- ❌ **DON'T:** Frame it as "revolutionary new marketplace" (requires transformation)

## 🧠 Customer Behavior Insights

### The Three Laws of Customer Psychology

![Customer Behavior Insights](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/customer_behavior_insights_1769738712669.png)

#### Law #1: Customers Don't Buy "Better"—They Buy Less Pain
- **What this means:** Features don't sell. Pain relief sells.
- **For AddManuChain:** 
  - Don't lead with "AI-powered matching algorithm"
  - Lead with "Stop wasting 3 weeks searching for suppliers"

#### Law #2: Customers Don't Seek Transformation—They Seek Relief
- **What this means:** Big change is scary. Small, immediate relief is valuable.
- **For AddManuChain:**
  - Don't pitch "Transform your supply chain"
  - Pitch "Fix your slowest procurement bottleneck"

#### Law #3: Customers Don't Seek Efficiency First—They Seek Comfort
- **What this means:** Familiar > Efficient. Safe > Optimal.
- **For AddManuChain:**
  - Integration with existing tools (email, ERP) is more important than standalone platform
  - Gradual adoption path > "rip and replace"

## 🔍 The 4-Question Interview Framework

### Mastering Customer Discovery

![Four Key Interview Questions](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/four_key_interview_questions_1769738627757.png)

#### Question 1: "Tell me about the last time this happened"
**Purpose:** Get concrete stories, not hypothetical opinions

**Why it works:**
- Forces specificity (real experience vs. abstract thinking)
- Reveals actual behavior (not stated preferences)
- Uncovers context you wouldn't think to ask about

**Example Application:**
- ❌ "Do you struggle to find 3D printing suppliers?"
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time you needed to source a 3D printed part"

---

#### Question 2: "How did you solve this problem?"
**Purpose:** Discover existing workarounds (proof of demand)

**Why it works:**
- If they're already solving it (even badly), the pain is REAL
- Workarounds show willingness to invest effort
- Reveals your competition (current solution, not other startups)

**Critical Insight:** 
> Your competition is NOT other AM marketplaces.  
> Your competition is manual Google searches + phone calls + existing supplier relationships.

---

#### Question 3: "What was frustrating about the way you handled it?"
**Purpose:** Identify pain points in current solution

**Why it works:**
- Reveals what customers actually care about (not what you assume)
- Prioritizes features by lived experience
- Surfaces emotional pain (stronger buying signal than rational need)

**For AddManuChain:**
- If they say "It took too long" → Emphasize speed
- If they say "I couldn't trust the quality" → Emphasize certification
- If they say "I had too many options" → Emphasize precision matching (H43!)

---

#### Question 4: "How much did this solution cost?"
**Purpose:** Reveal willingness to pay

**Why it works:**
- **If they paid before, they'll pay again**
- Establishes budget range
- Differentiates "nice to have" from "must have"

**Value Hierarchy:**
- **Paid in cash** = High value, proven willingness to pay
- **Paid in time/effort** = Medium value, shows importance but unclear pricing
- **Free workaround** = Low value, may not be monetizable

---

## ❌✅ Wrong vs. Right Questions

### The Art of Non-Leading Questions

![Wrong vs Right Questions](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/wrong_vs_right_questions_1769738648809.png)

### Why "Would you use X?" is a Terrible Question

**The Problem:**
1. **Lead the witness:** Suggests what answer you want
2. **Hypothetical:** People are bad at predicting future behavior
3. **Binary:** Loses nuance and context
4. **Confirmation bias:** You hear what you want to hear

**Example from Week 4:**

| ❌ Wrong Question | ✅ Better Questions |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "Would you use a marine robot for data collection?" | "How do you currently collect oceanic data?" |
| | "What's the most frustrating part of the process?" |
| | "Have you ever tried a different way? What happened?" |
| | "If you could magically fix one thing about your process, what would it be?" |

### Application to AddManuChain Interviews

**Instead of asking:**
- ❌ "Would you use an online marketplace to find 3D printing facilities?"

**Ask:**
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time you needed a custom part made"
- ✅ "How did you find the manufacturer?"
- ✅ "What made that process difficult?"
- ✅ "If you could change one thing about finding suppliers, what would it be?"

## 📊 Customer Pain Assessment Framework

### Severity vs. Frequency Matrix

![Customer Pain Severity Matrix](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/customer_pain_severity_matrix_1769738662242.png)

### The Four Quadrants

| Quadrant | Severity | Frequency | Action | Example |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** ⚠️ | HIGH | HIGH | **Target immediately** | Offshore equipment failure ($500K/day downtime) |
| **Monitor** 👁️ | HIGH | LOW | Track, may worsen | Regulatory audit failures |
| **Nice to Have** 🎁 | LOW | HIGH | Low priority | Minor UI annoyances |
| **Ignore** 🚫 | LOW | LOW | Not worth solving | Edge cases |

### Applying to Your Interviews

**Jason Power (Offshore Drilling):**
- **CRITICAL pain:** Equipment downtime ($500K-$1M/day)
- **Frequency:** Medium (boom/bust cycles)
- **Signal:** High severity = willingness to pay premium for solutions

**Sean Morgan (Atlantic XL):**
- To be determined in interview
- Look for high severity + high frequency pains

**Dr. Priti Wanjara (NRC):**
- **CRITICAL pain:** Certification bottlenecks (if admin time = 60%+)
- **Frequency:** High (if they process many requests)
- **Signal:** Pain justified by data = strong hypothesis support

---

## 🔄 Hypothesis Testing Cycle

###The Continuous Learning Loop

![Hypothesis Testing Cycle](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/hypothesis_testing_cycle_1769738729977.png)

### Four Stages of Scientific Customer Discovery

#### Stage 1: Form Hypothesis 💡
**What:** Make a testable assumption about customer pain/behavior

**Example:**
- H39: "Real-time communication platform reduces project delays by 30-50%"

#### Stage 2: Conduct Interview 💬
**What:** Ask questions that could **disprove** your hypothesis

**Critical Mindset:** Seek to be proven WRONG, not right

#### Stage 3: Analyze Results 🔍
**What:** Objectively assess evidence for/against hypothesis

**Framework:**
- **Strong support:** Customer described exact pain, paid to solve it before
- **Moderate support:** Customer acknowledged pain but hasn't paid to solve
- **Weak support:** Customer mentioned it but low priority
- **Rejected:** Customer doesn't experience this pain

#### Stage 4: Refine or Pivot 🔄
**What:** Update hypothesis based on evidence

**Three Outcomes:**
1. **Validate:** Evidence strongly supports → Move to implementation
2. **Refine:** Partial support → Adjust hypothesis, test again
3. **Pivot:** Evidence contradicts → Abandon, form new hypothesis

## 📈 Value Proposition Evolution

### From Vague to Validated

![Value Proposition Evolution](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/value_proposition_evolution_1769738750581.png)

### Before Interviews: The "Original Idea"

**Characteristics:**
- Vague and solution-focused
- Not grounded in real customer pain
- Based on assumptions, not evidence

**Example (hypothetical AddManuChain V1):**
> "A blockchain-enabled marketplace for 3D printing that connects manufacturers with facilities"

**Problems:**
- Who is the target customer? (vague)
- What job does it do? (unclear)
- Why blockchain? (solution looking for problem)

---

### After Interviews: The "Validated Value Proposition"

**Structure (from Week 4 template):**

```
We provide [TARGET CUSTOMER]
with [SOLUTION TYPE]
to [JOB TO BE DONE]
so that [KEY BENEFIT]
```

**AddManuChain Example (after 4 interviews):**

> "We provide **aerospace and offshore energy integrators** (CS.1)  
> with an **AI-driven supplier matching platform** (solution)  
> to **find certified AM facilities for non-critical parts in 48 hours vs. 3 weeks** (job)  
> so that **they reduce procurement costs and avoid project delays** (benefit)."

**Why this is better:**
- ✅ Specific target customer (not "manufacturers")
- ✅ Clear job to be done (speed up procurement)
- ✅ Quantified benefit (48 hours vs. 3 weeks)
- ✅ Grounded in interview insights (Jason, David, Bassey)

## 🛠️ Workaround Analysis Matrix

### Finding the Biggest Opportunities

![Workaround Analysis Matrix](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/workaround_analysis_matrix_1769738767582.png)

### The Strategic Principle

> **"Find the expensive, high-effort workarounds = biggest opportunity"**

### Why High-Cost, High-Effort Matters

**Customer Logic:**
- If they're spending $$$ and significant effort on a workaround...
- ...they've already PROVEN the pain is severe
- ...they've already justified budget for a solution
- ...they'll happily pay for something better/easier

**Example from Jason Interview:**

| Workaround | Cost | Effort | Opportunity |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| **$30-50M on-board inventory** | **HIGH** | HIGH | ❌ Won't optimize (shutdown risk too high) |
| **Manual predictive maintenance + parts ordering** | MEDIUM | **HIGH** | ✅ **HUGE** - "No one has solved this yet" |
| **Air-freight parts to offshore rigs** | **HIGH** | MEDIUM | ✅ **GOOD** - Regional AM hubs could replace |

### Applying to Your Interviews

**Questions to Ask:**
1. "What's the most expensive workaround you currently use?"
2. "What's the most time-consuming part of your current process?"
3. "If money/time were no object, what would you change first?"

**Red Flags (Low Opportunity):**
- "It's fine, we manage" → Low pain
- "We use a free tool" → No budget demonstrated
- "It only happens once a year" → Low frequency

## 👥 B2B Purchasing Decision Stakeholder Map

### Understanding Complex B2B Sales

![Purchasing Decision Stakeholder Map](/Users/admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/e9119f86-4f66-4b5b-88b6-68c56f76065c/purchasing_decision_stakeholder_map_1769738681729.png)

### The Six Stakeholders You Must Navigate

#### 1. Economic Buyer 💰
**Role:** Controls budget, makes final purchasing decision

**Questions they ask:**
- "What's the ROI?"
- "How much does this cost vs. current solution?"
- "What's the risk if this fails?"

**For AddManuChain:**
- Sean Morgan (Director) is likely the Economic Buyer
- Needs business case (cost savings, revenue increase)

---

#### 2. Technical Buyer ⚙️
**Role:** Evaluates whether solution will actually work

**Questions they ask:**
- "Does this integrate with our ERP?"
- "What quality standards do facilities meet?"
- "What happens if a part fails?"

**For AddManuChain:**
- Engineering managers, quality assurance leads
- Needs technical proof (certifications, case studies)

---

#### 3. End User 👤
**Role:** Will actually use the product day-to-day

## 🎯 Critical Insights for AddManuChain (Week 4 Synthesis)

### Deep Strategic Learnings

#### 1. **Target the Pain, Not the Innovation**

**Wrong Approach:**
> "AddManuChain uses AI and blockchain to revolutionize 3D printing supply chains"

**Right Approach:**
> "Stop wasting 3 weeks finding certified suppliers. Find them in 48 hours."

**Why:** Customers buy relief, not innovation.

---

#### 2. **Workarounds Prove Market Demand**

**What to look for in remaining interviews:**
- Are customers already solving this problem?
- How much do they spend (time/money)?
- How frustrated are they with current solution?

**If they have NO workaround:**
- Either: Pain isn't severe enough
- Or: You haven't uncovered the real job to be done

---

#### 3. **High Effort + High Cost Workarounds = Opportunity**

**From Jason Interview:**
- Manual predictive maintenance → parts ordering = High effort
- "No one has accomplished this yet" = No existing solution
- **VALIDATION:** This is where AddManuChain should focus

**Signal for Sean/John interviews:**
- Listen for expensive, time-consuming processes
- Quantify cost/effort of current solutions

---

#### 4. **Stakeholder Mapping is Critical for B2B**

**AddManuChain Must Satisfy:**
- **Economic Buyer:** ROI, cost savings
- **Technical Buyer:** Quality, certifications, integrations
- **End User:** Ease of use, simplicity
- **Champion:** Someone who will advocate internally

**You CANNOT just sell to one stakeholder.**

---

#### 5. **Cognitive Simplicity > Feature Richness**

**Application:**
- H43 (quality-over-quantity matching) is VALIDATED by Week 4 framework
- Customers want 3 perfect matches, not 50 options
- Simplicity reduces cognitive load = faster decisions

---

## 📊 Mapping Interview Insights to Week 4 Framework

### Cross-Referencing Learnings

#### Insight from Jason: Risk Categorization is Primary Decision Factor

**Week 4 Framework Validation:**
- ✅ Customers optimize for **least risk** (not best solution)
- ✅ Safety-critical parts = customers seek **comfort first** (existing inventory)
- ✅ Job to be done: "Avoid catastrophic downtime" (not "optimize inventory")

**Implication:**
- AddManuChain must have AUTOMATED risk assessment (can't be manual)
- Must integrate with regulatory verification
- **This is the FIRST filter customers apply**

---

#### Insight from David: Universities/Labs Outsource AM

**Week 4 Framework Validation:**
- ✅ Current workaround exists (outsourcing) = proof of demand
- ✅ High effort (manual sourcing) + Medium cost = opportunity
- ✅ Job to be done: "Access AM without building in-house lab"

**Implication:**
- CS.3 (Labs) are not just certification bodies
- They're also potential CLIENTS (need AM; services for research)

---

#### Insight from Bassey: Communication Delays Cause 30-50% of Issues

**Week 4 Framework Validation:**
- ✅ H39 (real-time communication) = **pain relief** (not efficiency)
- ✅ Customers optimize for **fastest relief** (status updates reduce anxiety)
- ✅ Mentioned across ALL 5 segments = universal pain

**Implication:**
- Communication platform is not a "nice to have"
- It's a **pain reliever** across entire customer base
- **Must be core feature, not add-on**

---

## 🚀 Action Items for Remaining Interviews

### Applying Week 4 Learnings to Interviews 5-7

#### Interview #5: Sean Morgan

**Jobs-to-be-Done Questions:**
1. "Tell me about the last time a project got delayed due to supplier issues"
2. "How did you solve that problem?"
3. "What was most frustrating about the process?"
4. "How much did that delay cost Atlantic XL?"

**Workaround Analysis:**
- Listen for HIGH COST + HIGH EFFORT workarounds
- Quantify time/money spent on current solutions

**Stakeholder Mapping:**
- Is Sean the Economic Buyer? Or does someone above him control budget?
- Who else would need to approve a platform like AddManuChain?

---

#### Interview #6: John Lidstone

**Jobs-to-be-Done Questions:**
1. "Tell me about the last time you finished a design and needed it manufactured"
2. "How did you find the manufacturer?"
3. "What was frustrating about that process?"
4. "How much time did the entire process take?"

**End User Perspective:**
- Would HE actually use AddManuChain daily?
- What would make him STOP using it? (cognitive complexity, slow, confusing)

---

#### Interview #7: Dr. Priti Wanjara

**Jobs-to-be-Done Questions:**
1. "Tell me about a recent certification request that took longer than expected"
2. "What caused the delay?"
3. "How much time does NRC spend on administrative vs. technical work?"
4. "Have you ever considered digital/automated workflows?"

**Influencer Validation:**
- Would she recommend AddManuChain to aerospace manufacturers?
- What would make her TRUST the platform?
- Could NRC partner/integrate with platform?

---

## 🎓 Week 4 Reflection Template

> **Challenges I've overcome:**  
> Understanding the difference between customer-stated preferences (unreliable) vs. customer behavior (truth). Learning to ask about PAST actions, not FUTURE intentions.

> **Biggest 'AHA' moment:**  
> Customers don't optimize for "best"—they optimize for least disruption, least risk, fastest relief. This completely reframes how I pitch AddManuChain.

> **My biggest achievement:**  
> Jason Power interview revealed that INTEGRATORS (not operators) are the right target customer. This is a fundamental pivot that saves months of wasted effort.

> **What I still need to overcome:**  
> Validating whether the platform can deliver fast enough certification verification to meet "fastest relief" customer need. Need technical feasibility assessment.

> **What I still need to improve on:**  
> Asking follow-up questions to quantify pain. Need to get NUMBERS: How much does this cost you? How often does this happen? How much time do you spend on this?

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways (Week 4 Deep Insights)

### Top 10 Strategic Learnings

1. **Customers hire products to get jobs done** → Focus on outcomes, not features

2. **Markets are rational; your assumptions are wrong** → Customers optimize for comfort/relief, not best/optimal

3. **Workarounds prove demand** → If they're solving it (even badly), pain is real

4. **High cost + high effort workarounds = biggest opportunities** → They've proven willingness to pay

5. **Ask about past behavior, not future intentions** → "Tell me about the last time..." is your most powerful question

6. **Pain severity + frequency = priority matrix** → Target high severity + high frequency first

7. **B2B requires satisfying multiple stakeholders** → Economic buyer ≠ Technical buyer ≠ End user

8. **Cognitive simplicity beats feature richness** → 3 perfect matches > 50 mediocre options

9. **Value proposition must evolve with evidence** → Original idea → Validated proposition (after interviews)

10. **Hypothesis testing is a continuous loop** → Form → Test → Analyze → Refine → Repeat
