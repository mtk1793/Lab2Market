**Subject:** Following Up on Week 7 Mentor Panel — IP Strategy for AddManuChain

Hi Shelley,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out after the Week 7 mentor panel session — your insights about IP protection have been weighing on my mind as I move forward with AddManuChain.

Your comment really stuck with me: **"Don't talk about your IP publicly until you've protected it."** I realized that I've been talking about our platform's matching algorithm and digital inventory approach fairly openly in customer interviews, and I'm now concerned about whether I've already exposed something we should have protected first.

Over the past week, as I've continued customer discovery and prepared for key meetings (including one with Lloyd's Register), I've been thinking about what IP we actually have:

- **Our matching algorithm** connecting manufacturers with certified AM suppliers
- **Our digital inventory and predictive maintenance system**
- **Our supplier vetting and certification validation methodology**
- **The data we're collecting on operator pain points**

I'd love to sit down with you to:

1. **Understand what we've already disclosed** (and whether it's a problem)
2. **Do an IP audit** to identify all the IP assets we have
3. **Develop a protection strategy** before we bring in investors or scale further
4. **Learn about the Elevate IP program** — I believe we're still under 10 years old, which could make us eligible

Your philosophy about "the bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity" also really resonates with what I'm learning in customer interviews. The more I talk to manufacturers and operators, the more I realize the supply chain + certification integration is a massive problem — which means the opportunity is equally massive.

Would you have time in the next 2-3 weeks for a 30-45 minute conversation? I'd like to explore this properly and make sure we're protecting what we've built.

Thank you for the guidance during Week 7 — it's already changing how I think about the business.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Hi Shelley,

Quick follow-up on my previous email — wanted to make sure it landed. I'm really keen to get your perspective on our IP strategy before we continue scaling customer validation.

Let me know what works for your schedule.
