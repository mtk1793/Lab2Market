**Subject:** Following Up on Week 7 Mentor Panel — Going Deeper in Customer Discovery

Hi Paul,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out after the Week 7 mentor panel — your advice about going "one level deeper" in customer discovery has completely changed how I approach interviews.

Your insight really hit home: **"If all you do is listen to the problems the way they express them, there's going to be very little room for innovation. You have to go one level deeper."** I realized that many of my early interviews were accepting surface-level problem statements without really digging into the root cause.

Over the past week, I've been applying this approach and it's been revelatory. For example:

- **Surface problem:** "We need to find certified AM suppliers faster"
- **One level deeper:** "Actually, what's keeping us up at night is proving to regulators and insurance companies that AM parts meet their standards"
- **Even deeper:** "The real bottleneck is certification bodies don't have clear processes for AM parts yet"

This led to an interview with Lloyd's Register that I have coming up — completely different conversation than I would have had before.

I've also been thinking about your point on dual-use advantage. AddManuChain could work for commercial manufacturers, but it could also be positioned as a Navy/defence capability if we get the commercial validation first. That's a massive unlocking opportunity.

Here's what I'm wrestling with now:

1. **How to keep asking "why"** without annoying customers (where's the balance?)
2. **How to spot patterns** in feedback — when is feedback a pivot signal vs. just one person's preference?
3. **How to plan for the long B2B sales cycles** I'm seeing in maritime/offshore/defence (12-36 months) without burning cash
4. **How to position dual-use** (commercial first, then defence) in a way that doesn't seem like a bait-and-switch to either segment

I'd love to sit down with you to discuss:

- How to go deeper in interviews without being obnoxious
- Pattern recognition in customer feedback
- Sales cycle and runway planning for B2B markets
- Dual-use positioning strategy

Your philosophy — **"The best entrepreneurs ask the best questions, not the ones with the best answers"** — is reshaping how I think about my role in this discovery phase.

Would you have time in the next 2-3 weeks for a 45-minute conversation? I'd love to get your perspective on how we navigate these tensions as we move from validation to commercialization.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Hi Paul,

Quick follow-up on my previous email. I'm really keen to discuss how to refine our customer discovery approach and think about the longer sales cycles we're seeing in this space.

Let me know if you have time in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
