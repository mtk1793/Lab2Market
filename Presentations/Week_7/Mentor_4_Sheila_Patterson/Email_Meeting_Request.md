**Subject:** Following Up on Week 7 Mentor Panel — Offshore Wind Supply Chain Opportunity

Hi Sheila,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up after the Week 7 mentor panel — your insights about offshore wind as a "green field" opportunity have been rattling around my brain all week in the best way possible.

Your comment really stuck with me: **"Offshore wind is being built right now. There's an opportunity to embed innovative solutions from the start rather than trying to retrofit."** It made me realize that AddManuChain might be solving the supply chain problem at exactly the right moment in the offshore wind transition.

Here's what's been happening:

- I've been interviewing manufacturers, operators, and certification bodies
- The pattern that's emerging is supply chain + certification integration = massive opportunity
- But most of these conversations have been in the traditional maritime/offshore energy space
- I haven't really dug into the **offshore wind supply chain challenge** from the perspective of building it from scratch

Your insight about local manufacturing capability gaps is exactly what AddManuChain could address. If offshore wind companies need to:

1. **Manufacture components locally** instead of sourcing globally
2. **Validate those components** against certification standards quickly
3. **Manage predictive maintenance** for distributed supply chains
4. **Build resilient, local supply networks** from the ground up

...then our platform could be embedded from day one, not retrofitted later.

I'm also thinking about your advice on active listening: **"Shut your mouth and stand back. See where they're tripping up."** I realize I've been pitching features instead of observing where customers are actually struggling. That shift in perspective is going to fundamentally change how I approach remaining interviews.

I'd love to sit down with you to:

1. **Deep dive on offshore wind supply chain gaps** — what are the critical bottlenecks?
2. **Understand the buying process** for offshore wind companies (you mentioned 3+ approval levels, 6-month pilots)
3. **Explore how to get embedded early** in the offshore wind buildout
4. **Discuss COVE connections** — could the entrepreneurship ecosystem help validate this opportunity?
5. **Learn the active listening technique** you described (and practice it!)

Your dual perspective — both from private industry AND government/economic development — gives you insights that I think could be transformational for how we position this opportunity.

Would you have time in the next 2-3 weeks for a 45-minute conversation? I think there's a real chance that offshore wind is the beachhead market for AddManuChain, and I'd like to explore that with you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Hi Sheila,

Quick follow-up on my previous email. I'm really keen to explore the offshore wind supply chain opportunity and get your perspective on how to embed solutions early in that industry transition.

Let me know what works for your schedule.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
