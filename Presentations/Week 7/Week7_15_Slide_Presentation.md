## Slide 5: KEY LEARNING #1 — PAUL BLEMER INSIGHTS (Interview #41)

### Background:
Paul Blemer = AM industry expert with decades of experience in aerospace, defense, and high-stakes manufacturing adoption

### Critical Insight: **Why AM Adoption Has Stalled in Critical Industries**

| Challenge | Reality | Implication for AddManuChain |
|-----------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Certification Complexity** | Current system requires 2+ years per part; no standardized pathway for AM parts in defense/aerospace | Must "own the certification layer" — partner with C-CORE, build pre-certified library |
| **Cultural Barriers** | Risk-averse industries (O&G, defense, aerospace) fear AM = unproven = liability | Position as "breakdown insurance" not "innovation" — emphasize reliability + sovereign resilience |
| **Volume Economics** | Traditional manufacturing = economies of scale; AM = low volume premium pricing | Target customers with **N+2 redundancy** (Arctic utilities), **obsolete parts** (15+ year install base), **one-off custom** (Kraken Robotics AUVs) |
| **FAT Testing Gap** | Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) for AM parts is undefined — no playbook | C-CORE partnership = FAT testing capability for marine certification |
| **AI/ML Adoption Lag** | ML for defect detection exists but is 5-10 years from full adoption due to trust issues | Position AI as "predictive maintenance + inventory optimization" not "quality control replacement" |

### 💡 Strategic Pivot:
> **We must build a platform that handles certification complexity FOR the customer, not just provide digital files and hope they figure it out.**

---

## Slide 6: KEY LEARNING #2 — MENTOR PANEL SESSION (Week 7)

### Mentor Panel Highlights (Feb 12):

| Mentor | Key Advice | How We Applied It |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Dwane Hokins** | "You don't have a product yet. Your hypothesis IS your product." | Shifted mindset: we're validating hypotheses, not selling a finished product |
| **Panel Consensus** | "Listen more than you talk. Customer should talk 80% of the time." | Updated interview script to be 90% questions, 10% explanation |
| **Sheila Patterson** | "Know when to pivot vs. persevere. Pivots are data-driven, not emotional." | Pivoted from "end-user operators" to "integrators/OEMs" based on Jason Power data |
| **Paul Blemer** | "Protect your IP early. Even in customer discovery." | Added confidentiality clause to interview follow-ups when discussing proprietary approaches |

### 💡 Key Takeaway:
Customer discovery is **active listening** + **hypothesis testing**. We're not pitching; we're learning.

## Slide 7: KEY LEARNING #3 — CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS & CHANNELS (Class Session)

### Week 7 Class Session Learnings:

**Buyer's Journey Framework:**
1. **Awareness** → "I have a problem"
2. **Consideration** → "I'm evaluating solutions"
3. **Decision** → "I'm choosing a vendor"

**Our Mapping for AddManuChain:**

| Stage | Customer Segment | Channel Strategy |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **Awareness** | Integrators/OEMs with obsolescence crises | Referrals (Darren Wood → Poly Unity), Industry events (CMA, Hannover Messe) |
| **Consideration** | Utilities with $4-5M inventory costs | ROI calculator + pilot proposals (Kraken Robotics, ERINL funding) |
| **Decision** | Defense/Navy with sovereign resilience mandate | Government anchor tenant (Lee Vessey $360K project), certification partnerships (C-CORE) |

### 💡 Strategic Insight:
**B2B sales in regulated industries = 12-15 month cycles.** We need to nurture relationships, not rush to close.

---

## Slide 8: QUANTITATIVE DATA UNLOCKED THIS SPRINT

### Hard Numbers Obtained:

| Metric | Value | Source | Validation |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| **Inventory per offshore vessel** | $30-50M | Jason Power (Noble/Valaris) | 5-10% of vessel value ($500M-$1B) |
| **Offshore drilling downtime cost** | $500K-$1M/day | Jason Power | Makes inventory hoarding rational |
| **Utility inventory value** | $4-5M | Adam Chubbs (Frobisher) | 8-10% of $50M asset base |
| **Transformer cost** | $100K each | Adam Chubbs | 5% spare ratio required |
| **Turbo + preservation costs** | $200K+ | Adam Chubbs | 10% of inventory = 90% of cost (Pareto) |
| **N+2 redundancy (Arctic mining)** | Highest inventory cost | Adam Chubbs | Diamond/gold mines in remote areas |
| **Emergency delivery time** | 10 days | Darren Wood (Proax) | Central Newfoundland motor case study |
| **Standard valve wait time** | 6 months | OMV Austria | Causes massive production losses |
| **ROI threshold (O&G)** | 15% minimum | OMV Austria | Required for AM adoption decision |

### 💡 Business Implication:
**With $4-5M inventory baseline, even a 20% reduction = $800K-$1M in working capital liberation.** This is a CFO-level ROI conversation.

## Slide 13: BEACHHEAD MARKET VALIDATED — ARCTIC/REMOTE OPERATIONS

### Why Arctic/Remote is the Beachhead:

| Pain Point | Arctic Amplification Factor | AddManuChain Solution |
|------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| **Logistics Cost** | Summer sealift only (June-Sept); winter = air freight (10x cost) | On-site AM eliminates air freight |
| **Redundancy Requirements** | N+2 redundancy for remote mining/utilities | Digital inventory reduces N+2 → N+1 |
| **Sovereign Resilience** | Federal mandate for northern communities to reduce southern dependence | Position as "sovereign supply chain solution" for defense/government |
| **Failure Risk** | Peak load failures in winter = worst case (highest demand + highest logistics cost) | AI predicts failures; digital inventory ready; AM produces on-site |

### Validated Evidence:
- **Adam Chubbs (Frobisher Energy):** "If there's a major failure in winter, the only option is to fly it in which increases your costs big time."
- **Keith Healey (ERINL):** Arctic niche + sovereign resilience = funding priority
- **Darren Wood (Proax):** "10-day emergency delivery to Central Newfoundland" — AM could cut to hours

### 💡 Arctic = Highest pain + Highest willingness to pay + Government support

---

## Slide 14: CERTIFICATION STRATEGY REFINED

### The Certification Reality (Based on Paul Blemer + Industry Interviews):

**Challenge:**
- 2+ years per part for traditional certification (Dr. Ali Nasiri, Jim Granger)
- 86 certification templates required (John Lidstone, Atlantic XL)
- 4-year Lloyd's Register facility certification (John Lidstone)
- ASTM standards outdated for AM (John Lidstone)

**Solution Path:**

| Timeframe | Strategy | Target Customer Segment |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
| **Immediate (Year 1)** | **Self-certifying customers** — Utilities that don't require third-party certification (Adam Chubbs: "We don't look for that sticker") | Frobisher Energy, Arctic utilities, remote mining |
| **Short-term (Year 1-2)** | **Pre-certified parts library** — Use parts already certified (e.g., Tronosjet laser part can be reproduced without re-certifying - Dr. Ali Nasiri) | Start with 10-20 common offshore parts |
| **Medium-term (Year 2-3)** | **Facility-level qualification** — Get AM facility Lloyd's Register approval (Atlantic XL expected within weeks) | Partner with Atlantic XL, Poly Unity for certified production |
| **Long-term (Year 3+)** | **FAT testing partnership** — C-CORE develops Factory Acceptance Testing playbook for AM marine parts | Become THE certification pathway for marine AM parts |

### 💡 Strategy:
**Start where certification is lowest barrier (self-certifying utilities), build credibility, expand into regulated markets (defense, O&G) via partnerships.**
