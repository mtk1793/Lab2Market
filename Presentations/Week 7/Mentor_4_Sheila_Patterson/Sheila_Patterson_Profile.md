## Primary Role

### Nova Scotia Department of Energy — Offshore Wind Initiative

**What it is:**
- Shelia is working on **Nova Scotia's first offshore wind development**
- Strategic planning around supply chain implications
- Innovation and manufacturing opportunities arising from wind sector buildout

**Key Priorities:**
- What can Nova Scotia manufacture locally?
- What's the gap between current capabilities and what's needed?
- How to embed innovation solutions from the start (not retrofit)?

## Core Philosophy: Active Listening

**Quote:**
> "Really hone and understand what **active listening** means. As much as I might love my solution — which means I'm going to paint something purple — maybe it really needs to be painted blue."

**In Practice:**
> "If you have any opportunity to put your solution into the hands of a customer or user — **shut your mouth and stand back.** See where they're tripping up, see their reactions. They may come up with a use you hadn't imagined."

**Key insight:**
- Don't impose your vision
- Listen to actual customer behavior
- Observe reactions, not just words
- Customers may find uses you didn't imagine

## Key Expertise & Insights

### #1: Offshore Wind = Green Field Opportunity

**Quote:**
> "The offshore wind opportunity is massive from a supply chain perspective. There are components being manufactured all over the world for offshore wind turbines. The question is — **what can we manufacture locally?** And what's the gap between what we can do now and what we need to be able to do?"

**Strategic Context:**
- Offshore wind industry is being **built right now**
- Not retrofitting existing infrastructure — building from scratch
- Opportunity to embed innovative solutions from the beginning
- Unlike traditional industries where you have to overcome legacy processes

**Why this matters for AddManuChain:**
- **Green field = faster adoption** of new technologies
- **Embedded from start** = better long-term integration
- **Supply chain being designed now** = opportunity to influence
- **Manufacturing scale-up** = need for distributed/rapid manufacturing

### #2: Supply Chain Innovation Opportunity

**Quote:**
> "If you're looking at supply chain solutions — whether that's digital inventory, predictive maintenance, or logistics optimization — **offshore wind is a green field.** The industry is being built right now, so there's an opportunity to embed innovative solutions from the start rather than trying to retrofit."

**For AddManuChain specifically:**
- **Digital inventory** = relevant (tracking wind turbine components)
- **Predictive maintenance** = relevant (preventing offshore downtime)
- **Logistics optimization** = relevant (remote offshore locations)
- **Distributed manufacturing** = relevant (local AM for replacement parts on/offshore)

### #3: Understanding Customer Buying Processes

**Quote:**
> "Not understanding their customer's buying process. You might have the best technology in the world, but if you don't understand that your customer needs 3 levels of approval, a procurement process, insurance verification, and a 6-month pilot before they can issue a PO — you're going to be frustrated."

**For Offshore/Maritime Customers:**
- Safety certifications required
- Insurance approvals
- Multiple stakeholder sign-offs
- 6-12 month pilots before commitment
- Regulatory compliance pathways

### #4: Active Listening Over Pitching

**Quote:**
> "See where they're tripping up, see their reactions. They may come up with a use you hadn't imagined."

**Practical advice:**
- Shut up and watch (don't narrate your vision)
- Observe customer behavior, not just listen to words
- Let customers discover value themselves
- They may find uses you didn't imagine
