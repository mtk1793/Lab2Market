## Q&A Session

### Q1: The Importance of the Customer (Joanna)

**Shelley:** "It's the foundation, the nucleus of what you need to do. You don't want to build a product nobody wants, because you want revenue. **The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.** It's really important to get objective, unbiased feedback."

**Sheila — Active Listening:**
> "Really hone and understand what **active listening** means. As much as I might love my solution — which means I'm going to paint something purple — maybe it really needs to be painted blue."
>
> "If you have any opportunity to put your solution into the hands of a customer or user — **shut your mouth and stand back.** See where they're tripping up, see their reactions. They may come up with a use you hadn't imagined."

**Paul — Go One Level Deeper:**
> "If all you do is listen to the problems the way they express them, there's going to be very little room for innovation because those are **known ways of expressing problems.** You're going to have to go **one level deeper** — use your innovative thinking to ask questions about how they think about their problems in a way that starts to reveal the **space for your innovation.**"
>
> "Keep asking **why** — being genuinely curious about why they have problems and what solutions they've already considered — is going to open up that innovation space."

**David — Pain vs. Problem, and the Faster Horse:**
> "There's a big difference between a **pain** and a **problem**. A pain can be a symptom, whereas the problem is the cause. You need to get down to the **cause**."
>
> "The problem wasn't 'how do you create a faster horse?' — the problem was 'how do you quickly and efficiently transport people and goods across the country?' — and you had the creation of the automobile."

**David — Real-World Failure:**
> "We had an undesirable outcome where the value of the problem solved was **10% of the cost of the solution**. You need to find problems **worth solving**. You can't have a $150,000/year solution solving a $15,000/year problem."
>
> "They didn't speak to us for 6 months. When they presented to our executive, they were not well received because **they made assumptions about how their customer acted, but were incorrect.**"

**David — Know Your First Customer:**
> "There's no point developing something if you don't know who your first customer is going to be. You might have a list, but you should know — **this is my first customer, and this is someone who looks a lot like her.**"

### Q2: Michael's Question to Sheila (Offshore Wind Supply Chain)

**Michael:** You mentioned you're working in the energy sector. We know about the net-zero ambitions for Nova Scotia. You also mentioned supply chain. My project is somehow related — can you speak to the opportunities there?

**Sheila:**
> "The offshore wind opportunity is massive from a supply chain perspective. There are components being manufactured all over the world for offshore wind turbines. The question is — **what can we manufacture locally?** And what's the gap between what we can do now and what we need to be able to do?"
>
> "If you're looking at supply chain solutions — whether that's digital inventory, predictive maintenance, or logistics optimization — **offshore wind is a green field.** The industry is being built right now, so there's an opportunity to embed innovative solutions from the start rather than trying to retrofit."

---

### Q3: How Do You Know When to Pivot? (Team Question)

**Paul:**
> "If you get consistent feedback that challenges your core assumption — not just one or two people — but **when a pattern emerges**, that's when you need to consider a pivot. But don't confuse a pivot with giving up. A pivot is **using what you've learned** to redirect, not starting from scratch."

**David:**
> "Market signals are key. If you've talked to 20 people and 15 of them are telling you the problem isn't what you thought it was — **listen to the data.** Your ego will fight you on this. Your passion for your original idea will fight you. But the data doesn't lie."

**Shelley:**
> "And if you're going to pivot, make sure you're **documenting why.** Because your investors, your accelerators, your mentors — they all want to see that you made data-driven decisions, not emotional ones."

---

### Q4: IP & Intellectual Property for Startups (Team Question)

**Shelley — Elevate IP Program:**
> "A lot of founders think IP is just patents. It's not. **IP is everything** — your trade secrets, your branding, your proprietary processes, your data, your algorithms. The Elevate IP program helps you figure out **what you actually have** and how to protect it."
>
> "One thing I tell startups: **don't talk about your IP publicly until you've protected it.** Once you've disclosed it, you may lose your ability to protect it. So talk to us first."

**Key IP Categories:**
- **Patents:** Expensive, time-consuming, but powerful for hardware/processes
- **Trade Secrets:** Free to maintain, but must actively protect (NDAs, employee agreements)
- **Copyright:** Automatic for software code, creative works
- **Trademarks:** Brand protection
- **Industrial Design:** Physical appearance of products

> "The Elevate IP program is **free** for eligible startups — less than 10 years old. We'll do an IP audit, help you develop a strategy, and even fund some of the legal costs."

### Q5: Getting Into the Defence Sector (Michael's Question)

**Michael:** How can I approach the defense sector? I've heard there's big money there.

**David:**
> "Defence is a very specific market. The procurement cycles are long — **18 to 36 months minimum.** But the budgets are real and the contracts are large. If you can get in through a **prime contractor** (like Irving, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems), they often have innovation programs specifically designed to bring in small companies."

**Sheila:**
> "Look at the **Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) policy** — when the government makes a major defence purchase, the primes are required to reinvest a percentage back into Canadian companies. That creates opportunities for startups."

**Paul:**
> "And don't forget **dual-use** applications. If your technology has both civilian and defence applications, that makes it much more attractive. The defence folks love it when they can point to a technology that's already been proven in a commercial context."

---

### Q6: Networking and Building Relationships (Team Question)

**Sheila:**
> "Your network is your net worth. And I know that sounds cliché, but it's absolutely true. The **warm introduction** is 10 times more effective than a cold email. So every person you talk to — ask them: **'Who else should I be talking to?'** Build that web."

**David:**
> "And when someone gives you a referral — **follow up within 48 hours.** The connection is warm right now. The person who referred you might forget about it in a week. So act fast."

**Shelley:**
> "Also, don't underestimate the **ecosystem players** — accelerators, incubators, economic development agencies, university tech transfer offices. We all know each other. We all talk. If you make a good impression on one of us, it ripples through the entire ecosystem."

---

### Q7: Common Mistakes Startups Make (Joanna)

**David — #1 Mistake:**
> "**Building before validating.** I see it all the time. Founders spend 6 months and $100,000 building something that nobody asked for. Validate first. Build second."

**Shelley — #2 Mistake:**
> "**Not protecting their IP.** They'll pitch at competitions, post on social media, share their source code on GitHub — and then come to me wondering why they can't file a patent. It's too late."

**Paul — #3 Mistake:**
> "**Underestimating the sales cycle.** Especially in B2B. You think you're going to close a deal in 3 months. It takes 12. And you've burned through your cash. **Plan for the long sales cycle.** Have enough runway."

**Sheila — #4 Mistake:**
> "**Not understanding their customer's buying process.** You might have the best technology in the world, but if you don't understand that your customer needs 3 levels of approval, a procurement process, insurance verification, and a 6-month pilot before they can issue a PO — you're going to be frustrated."

---

### Closing Advice

**David:** "Find problems worth solving. Know your first customer. And don't build anything until someone tells you they'd pay for it."

**Shelley:** "Protect your IP early. Use the free resources available to you. And be brave enough to ask for help."

**Paul:** "Be genuinely curious. The best entrepreneurs I've worked with are the ones who ask the best questions — not the ones who have the best answers."

**Sheila:** "Active listening. Put yourself in your customer's shoes. And remember — **offshore wind is wide open** for innovation. Come talk to me if you're interested."

## Key Takeaways for AddManuChain (Michael's Notes)

1. **"Find problems worth solving"** — David's $150K solution for $15K problem = failure. Ensure AddManuChain's ROI math works for the customer.
2. **"Go one level deeper"** — Paul's advice aligns with the customer discovery methodology — don't just accept surface-level answers.
3. **"Active listening > pitching"** — Sheila's advice to shut up and let the customer react to the product.
4. **"Pain ≠ Problem"** — David's distinction. Spare parts logistics is a pain; the PROBLEM may be deeper (certification system, OEM lock-in, legacy processes).
5. **Offshore wind = green field** — Sheila confirms this sector is being built now — opportunity to embed from the start.
6. **Defence via primes** — ITB policy creates mandatory opportunities. Dual-use is the fast track.
7. **Protect IP early** — Shelley's Elevate IP program is FREE and could help formalize AddManuChain's digital inventory IP.
8. **48-hour referral follow-up rule** — David's advice on warm introductions.
9. **Plan for 12-15 month sales cycles** — Paul and Carol both confirm this for B2B/O&G.
