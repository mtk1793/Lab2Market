## Core Philosophy: Demand-Led Innovation

**Quote:**
> "We do **demand-led innovation** — looking for the problem and then finding the innovator is our ideal model, rather than trying to push something onto the market that may not be a problem experienced."

**What this means:**
- Start with a real problem identified by a real customer
- Then source or develop the solution
- Much higher success rate than inventing first, finding customer second

## Key Expertise & Insights

### #1: Pain vs. Problem

**Quote:**
> "There's a big difference between a **pain** and a **problem**. A pain can be a symptom, whereas the problem is the cause. You need to get down to the **cause**."

**Example Given:**
> "The problem wasn't 'how do you create a faster horse?' — the problem was 'how do you quickly and efficiently transport people and goods across the country?' — and you had the creation of the automobile."

**For AddManuChain:**
- "Finding certified AM suppliers" = pain/symptom
- Real problem = ? (Could be: OEM lock-in, certification bottleneck, distributed manufacturing risk, supply chain resilience, etc.)

### #2: Know the Customer Economics

**Critical Warning:**
> "We had an undesirable outcome where the value of the problem solved was **10% of the cost of the solution**. You need to find problems **worth solving**. You can't have a $150,000/year solution solving a $15,000/year problem."

**Real-world failure story:**
> "They didn't speak to us for 6 months. When they presented to our executive, they were not well received because **they made assumptions about how their customer acted, but were incorrect.**"

**Key lesson:**
- Always validate customer economics
- Ensure ROI math works for the customer
- Don't assume customer behavior — verify it

### #3: Know Your First Customer

**Quote:**
> "There's no point developing something if you don't know who your first customer is going to be. You might have a list, but you should know — **this is my first customer, and this is someone who looks a lot like her.**"

**Why this matters:**
- Directs all development and validation work
- Provides focus for pivot decisions
- Ensures product-market fit for at least one customer

### #4: How Do You Know When to Pivot?

**Quote:**
> "Market signals are key. If you've talked to 20 people and 15 of them are telling you the problem isn't what you thought it was — **listen to the data**. Your ego will fight you on this. Your passion for your original idea will fight you. But the data doesn't lie."

**Also:**
> "Building before validating. I see it all the time. Founders spend 6 months and $100,000 building something that nobody asked for. Validate first. Build second."

### #5: Getting From Idea to Market

**48-Hour Referral Rule:**
> "And when someone gives you a referral — **follow up within 48 hours.** The connection is warm right now. The person who referred you might forget about it in a week. So act fast."

## For AddManuChain

**Relevant to AddManuChain's Work:**

1. **Demand-Led Validation** — Use David's approach to ensure AddManuChain solves real problems
   - Spare parts logistics = pain
   - Real problem = ? (Needs validation with customers)

2. **Port Halifax as Pilot** — Supply chain innovation opportunity
   - Ports deal with spare parts, logistics, downtime
   - Maritime industry = right sector

3. **First Customer Definition** — David's advice applies
   - Who is AddManuChain's first customer?
   - Who looks like them? (Define the segment)

4. **Economics Validation** — Ensure ROI math works for customers
   - Don't make David's $150K solution mistake
   - Customer's problem value >> solution cost

**Recommendation:**
- **Connect with The Pier** about pilot opportunities
- **Use David's demand-led approach** for remaining customer validation
- **Validate first customer economics** before scaling
