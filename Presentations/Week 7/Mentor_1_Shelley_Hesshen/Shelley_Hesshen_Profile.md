## Key Expertise & Insights

### IP is Everything (Not Just Patents)

**Quote:**
> "A lot of founders think IP is just patents. It's not. IP is everything — your trade secrets, your branding, your proprietary processes, your data, your algorithms."

**IP Categories Shelley Helps With:**
1. **Patents** — Expensive & time-consuming, but powerful for hardware/processes
2. **Trade Secrets** — Free to maintain, but must actively protect (NDAs, employee agreements)
3. **Copyright** — Automatic for software code, creative works
4. **Trademarks** — Brand protection
5. **Industrial Design** — Physical appearance of products

### Protecting IP Early is Critical

**Key Warning:**
> "Don't talk about your IP publicly until you've protected it. Once you've disclosed it, you may lose your ability to protect it. So talk to us first."

### The Customer is Foundation

**Quote:**
> "It's the foundation, the nucleus of what you need to do. You don't want to build a product nobody wants, because you want revenue. **The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity.** It's really important to get objective, unbiased feedback."

### Common Startup Mistake: IP Negligence

**Quote:**
> "They'll pitch at competitions, post on social media, share their source code on GitHub — and then come to me wondering why they can't file a patent. It's too late."

### Advice on Pivoting

**Quote:**
> "And if you're going to pivot, make sure you're documenting why. Because your investors, your accelerators, your mentors — they all want to see that you made data-driven decisions, not emotional ones."

### Building Your Network

**Quote:**
> "Your network is your net worth. And I know that sounds cliché, but it's absolutely true. The warm introduction is 10 times more effective than a cold email. So every person you talk to — ask them: 'Who else should I be talking to?' Build that web."

**Ecosystem Leverage:**
> "Also, don't underestimate the ecosystem players — accelerators, incubators, economic development agencies, university tech transfer offices. We all know each other. We all talk. If you make a good impression on one of us, it ripples through the entire ecosystem."
