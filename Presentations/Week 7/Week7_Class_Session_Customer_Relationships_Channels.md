## Part 2: Carol's Lecture — Customer Relationships & Channel Ecosystems

### Recap: Customer Segments & Market Size

**Carol:** Welcome back everybody. I hope this was an amazing week of knowledge and you getting to know who your customers are. The problems that they have and bridging the gap to get there. So by now you have understood how to collect the data. And most of you are having an understanding of — *"Gee, it's not quite like I thought it was."* Is that true?

That's why we do this. Because if you had started right when you entered the program and we had said, "okay, we're going to invest some money in it, go away, do a business plan, come back out" — the majority of the companies would fail. So that's why we validate it.

### The Customer Journey Funnel

**Carol:** When we first meet a customer, that is **awareness**. Then they come through to **interest**, then through **consideration**. Perhaps maybe they go to a **purchase**. These are pathways you have to get them through in order to get them to buy. Once they buy, we'll go to **keeping them** and then **growing them**.

So this is the world that I live in. I only talk to people who want to **get customers, keep customers, or grow customers.**

Over here we have the **buyers or stakeholders** — they could be:
- An economic buyer
- An influencer
- A saboteur
- A decision maker
- An end user

### Key Questions to Answer About Your Customer

**Carol:** It all starts with the customer. If there's no customer and there's no problems, then there is no reason for us to exist. So answering these questions:

1. **Who is your target customer?**
2. **What are they trying to accomplish?**
3. **What are their problems and their severity?**
4. **For what gains would they be willing to pay?**
5. **Does your solution solve their problem?**
6. **Does your solution bring any other additional value to their lives?**

Whether you're pivoting or not, you go back to your first block of the customer, and you rework it. This box will always be what we refer to as a **"living box"** — you're always refining it, adding to it, perfecting it.

### Value Proposition Canvas (Video)

**Carol:** Randy talked about the fit between the customer and the product — **Customer-Product Fit**. And Leah went into great detail about **customer market fit**, **product market fit**, and her specialty — **language market fit**, where you start talking the same language as the customer.

**[Video — Value Proposition Canvas by Strategyzer]:**

> The value proposition canvas is composed of 2 parts: the **customer profile** and the **value map**.
> 
> **Customer Profile:**
> - **Jobs:** Functional (getting from A to B), Social (impressing friends), Emotional (gaining peace of mind)
> - **Pains:** Negative outcomes customers hope to avoid — dissatisfaction, frustrations, risks, obstacles
> - **Gains:** Positive outcomes — concrete results, benefits, aspirations
> 
> **Value Map:**
> - **Products & Services** your value proposition builds on
> - **Pain Relievers:** How they eliminate, reduce, or minimize pains
> - **Gain Creators:** How they produce, increase, or maximize gains
> 
> **Fit** = clear connection between what matters to customers and how your products/services ease pains and create gains.
> 
> Great value propositions target **essential** customer jobs, pains, and gains — and do so **extremely well.**

### Customer Segment vs. Market

**Carol:** The **customer segment** is the group you're focused on. The **market** could be everyone you could provide value to.

**Example — Smart Weather Vane:**
- **Market:** Any boat could have a weather vane
- **Not a customer:** Kayaker (too small) or cargo ship (has GPS, radar, gyros)
- **Customer segment:** Recreational fishing folks with boats **24 to 44 feet**

> "I want you to narrow your customer segment down. For example, you might sell to all kinds of oil and gas companies, but narrow down — large O&G companies? Small? Tier ones? Tier twos?"

### Stereotyping Your Ideal Customer (Positive Stereotyping for Sales)

**Carol:** In sales, it's useful to stereotype people in a positive way:
- **Demographics:** Age (40-60 for boat owners), Gender, Income, Occupation, Education
- **Purpose:** When you go to market, you know exactly who you're looking for — and you can pick them out in a crowd

> **Carol's Networking Secret:** "If you go into a networking event with 100 people, you have about an hour to make a solid connection. Wouldn't it be good to know **exactly** who that is?"
>
> "The people who buy from me are **women in their 40s, in their first marriage, with 2 children, who've started businesses within the last 5 years, with a Master's or PhD, who are all scientists** and want to increase income. I'm going to look around the room — who am I going to target?"

### Crossing the Chasm (Geoffrey Moore)

**Carol:** The famous book by Geoffrey Moore — **"Crossing the Chasm"**:

```
Innovators → Early Adopters → [CHASM] → Early Majority → Late Majority → Laggards
```

- **Innovators:** Create the new stuff
- **Early Adopters:** ⭐ **ALL OF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THESE** — people willing to take a risk on you
- **Early Majority:** Adopt as everybody else is adopting ("everybody in my group is doing it")
- **Late Majority:** Wait until it's proven
- **Laggards:** Still getting iPhones, using flip phones

> **Carol's family example:** Her 88-year-old mother was an early adopter her entire life ("the first person to see it and want it"). Carol herself is in the late majority ("I have to know it's proven before I'm going to adopt"). Her brother is a laggard ("I'm surprised he has a cell phone — it's a flip phone").

**Crossing the chasm is expensive.** That's why being niche matters — you need a concentrated group of early adopters.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) — Don't Pursue Perfection

**Carol:** Remember:
- **Landlines** were crystal clear, never dropped calls — yet we all switched to cell phones (for mobility)
- **Digital cameras** replaced film despite lower quality initially
- **Electric cars** replacing gasoline despite limitations
- **LED lights** had drawbacks when first introduced

> "Make sure you don't get to perfection. Just go to market. It'll be okay to test it out."

### Understanding the Buyer's Perspective

**Carol:** *"You never really understand a person until you consider things from their points of view. Until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."*

Always see it from the other perspective:
- What are their other options?
- What do they want to look like in front of their boss if they adopt your technology?
- What if they go with another technology that is worse than yours but more proven?

### Mapping the Decision Maker — Complex Stakeholder Example

**Carol:** Remember the light bulb exercise? In a study room — you're the student, the decision maker, and the person affected. In the real world, it's much more complex.

**Real-World Example — Offshore Seismic Survey (Geohazard Survey):**

| Stakeholder | Role | Interest |
|---|---|---|
| **Atlantic Accord** | Body of Law / Rulemaker | Everything must conform to this legislation (1990s) |
| **C-NLOPB** | Regulatory Body | Ensures compliance with the Atlantic Accord |
| **Drilling Team** | End User | Had the pain, wanted safe wells, understood the technical side — **but had NO money** |
| **Management** | Economic Buyer | Had the money, not interested in technical stuff — only cared about **compliance, legal risk, and not being shut down** |
| **Board** | Influencer | Cared about **reputation and social license** |
| **Third-party provider** (Carol) | Service Provider | Collected and interpreted seismic data |

> "We had to talk to the drilling team, talk to management, sometimes talk to the boards, sometimes talk to the regulatory board. All of these just to get a simple contract."

**Stakeholder Roles in B2B Sales:**
- End User
- Decision Maker
- Economic Buyer
- Influencer
- Counselor
- **Saboteur** (hidden — you have to figure out who this is)
- Beneficiary
- Champion (may need the most convincing)

### Customer Relationships — Get, Keep, Grow

**Carol:** Customer relationships connect the value proposition with the customer segment. This is where the money is.

**Three Phases:**
1. **GET** — How do I get customers? (Where Carol spends most of her time)
2. **KEEP** — Customer service / retention
3. **GROW** — Upsell / expand revenue from existing customers

### The Buyer's Journey (Detailed)

#### Stage 1: Awareness (Top of Funnel)
- Customer acknowledges they have a problem
- If they DON'T know they have a problem → **you have to educate them** (takes much more time)
- Key questions:
  - What is the **job to be done**?
  - How are they doing it now?
  - How much does it cost them now?
  - How often does it happen? How severe?

#### Stage 2: Interest
- "Hmm, this might solve our problem. We should explore."
- They search online, attend conferences, look at consultants, tap personal network
- Look at pure review articles, type into ChatGPT

#### Stage 3: Consideration (Middle of Funnel)
- Narrowed down to 2-3 options
- What process do I have to go through?
- Do I need training to implement?
- Who else is involved in the decision?

> **Carol's Fortune 500 example:** "I would sell the software license, then the maintenance (20% of license), then training for all their people. We were printing money."

#### Stage 4: Purchase (Decision)
- What is the price? Where do I sign? PO or credit card?
- **Short sales cycle:** One session from awareness to close
- **Oil & gas sales cycle: 15 months** — tied to rig mobilization timelines ("Sonovis is bringing in a rig — it takes 15 months from decision to rig arrival")

> "Knowing that cycle, you have to be willing to pay all of your people until you get paid at the end of it."

### Customer Journey Map — Case Study: "CleanHaul"

**Product:** Autonomous hull-cleaning robot  
**Value Proposition:** Reduces fuel consumption by 15%, prevents invasive species (regulatory compliance)  
**Customer:** Fleet Manager at an OSV company in St. John's  

| Stage | Details |
|---|---|
| **Awareness (Trigger)** | High fuel consumption on a particular run |
| **Channel** | H2O conference, Marine Technology journal, NL marine tech publications |
| **Interest (Hook)** | "Solves the bleeding neck problem = **fuel cost**" (not barnacles — that's the *causation*) |
| **Action** | Visit websites, use ROI calculator → "$200K/year savings" |
| **Consideration (Hurdles)** | Safety person: "Is it safe?" → CFO: "Look at the ROI — $50K cost for CleanHaul" → Technical review |
| **Purchase** | Pilot successful → Procurement involved → Insurance/regulations → **Win contract for all 5 vessels** |

### Triggers — The Golden Concept

**Carol:** A **trigger** is an event or action that prompts a reaction or response.

**Examples:**
- **HR service providers:** Anytime a company posts for an HR person → reach out offering outsourced HR
- **Carol's own company:** When a company posts for a sales manager → "It looks like you want to increase sales. How can I help?"
- **Sarah's trigger (exercise):** New regulations require 20% more training hours, but travel budget got cut

> "If I'm the one trying to get the regulations passed — I know I can sell at least 20% more. That's golden."

## Part 3: Breakout Exercise — Rig Ready VR

**Scenario:** You are founders of **Rig Ready VR** in St. John's — creating VR safety training for offshore workers (fire response, lifeboat drills) to replace expensive in-person classroom days.

**Target Customer:** Sarah, VP of Health & Safety and Environment at a major oil operator  
**Trigger:** New regulations require 20% more training hours, but Sarah's travel budget for flying crews to town just got cut

#### Breakout Group Discussion (Michael's Group — with Randy mentoring):

| Stage | Team Discussion |
|---|---|
| **Awareness** | Sarah reaches out to her network/colleagues, attends conferences, searches Google/Gemini, subscribes to newsletters |
| **Interest** | Contacts 2-3 companies, requests demonstrations/proof of concept, uses ROI calculators |
| **Consideration** | Goes internal — talks to manager/VP for budget approval, contacts the regulator to verify compliance, reviews technical specs, validates ROI figures |
| **Purchase** | Stage-gating: Stage 1 = pilot, Stage 2 = partial rollout, Stage 3 = full rollout → Contracts office handles PO/terms |

**Randy's Key Insight:** "In your customer discovery, I get a lot of questions: 'Do I have to talk to the managers? The CEO?' They all have a role. This helps you understand how all those roles come to bear on ultimately making a sale."

## Part 4: Team Presentations (Sprint Updates)

### Team 9 — Port Energy Management System (Mohammed)

**Project:** AI-based energy management system for ports  
**Interviews conducted:** 7 total  
**Key findings:**
- **Data Centers — ELIMINATED:** Homegrown technologies already in use (Google, Microsoft); load isn't complex (known CPUs/GPUs); not a good customer segment
- **Mining Industry — POSITIVE:** Technology is very old (established 1950s-1970s); difficult to integrate modern AI; but companies are interested if positioned as cost-saving/easy-to-adopt
  - NL Power still doing calculations/predictions using Excel
- **Port Infrastructure:** Getting data from various Canadian ports (Montreal: 72 GWh/year, Toronto: 13.7 GWh/year, Hamilton-Oshawa: 0.58 GWh/year, Vancouver: fragmented data — 84 MW electrification only)
- **Defense:** Brief chat with defense contractor (warships) — huge budget but confidentiality limits info sharing

**Michael's Comments:** Validated defense as big-pocket opportunity; requested EV power consumption data from ports.

### Team 16 — AddManuChain (Michael/Mahmoud's Own Presentation)

**Michael's Sprint 3 Key Learnings & Pivots:**

#### Strategic Pivots:
| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Pitch: Digital inventory for AM parts | → **Supply chain intelligence + breakdown insurance** |
| First driver: Cost saving | → **Working capital liberation** (reducing working capital costs) |
| Target: End-user operators directly | → **Integrators and OEMs** (HMH, NOV) first — they provide approval |
| Tech: AI was a buzzword | → **AI is inevitable** (companies like Engineered Intelligence are using it) |

#### Decision Authority Wall:
> "If I just go to the end user by myself, I'm done. But if I go there and say I have the integrators, I have the certifications from Lloyd's, DNV — they're going to say 'let's give this guy a chance.'"

#### Financial Data Points:
- **$500 part failure** → $500K–$1M+ per day downtime
- **Inventory holding cost:** $30–50M per vessel
- **Downtime risk:** $500K–$1M per incident
- **Inventory maintenance:** $4–5M annually

#### Post-COVID Shift:
> "Most people are looking for the part to fail then order, rather than keep it in stock."

#### AI Pillar:
- Get engineering data → AI predicts failure → Digital trigger → Digital inventory → On-demand print or facility connection → Delivery beforehand

#### Certification Strategy:
- Atlantic XL pioneering with Lloyd's (1-4 years for certification)
- **Pivot:** Focus on **self-certification or non-critical parts first** → build name and revenue → then pursue critical parts

#### IP Protection — Raspberry Pi Black Box:
> "Put a Raspberry Pi locally at the end user — completely secured, encrypted, black box. Every time they need to print something, they use that computer. Nobody has access except the OEM."

#### Arctic Beachhead:
> "Had a really interesting conversation today with a gentleman working in Arctic — they have a huge problem there because everything is remote."

#### Market Sizing:
| Level | Amount |
|---|---|
| **TAM** | $35–50 billion/year |
| **SAM** | $200–500 million |
| **Long-term target (5-10 years)** | $50–75 million |
| **First goal (5-8 pilots)** | $300K–$600K |

**Carol's Question:** "Have you considered that companies will take more time to decide — 'Do I want to print the part? Do I want to have somebody engineer it? Do I want to just order the part?' That decision-making is going to be more complex." (Michael: noted for investigation)

### Team 5 — Marine Observation Systems Power Harvesting (Masoud)

**Project:** RF energy harvesting for marine observation systems  
**Key Progress:**
- Talked to marine systems manufacturers → They advise contacting OEMs directly because "if OEMs equip their devices with that technology, we will use it anyway"
- **New focus:** Original Equipment Manufacturers as primary customer segment
- **Ideal Customer Persona:** Offshore Systems Integration Manager, 35-55 years old, 10+ years marine systems experience, Norse/US/North Sea/Offshore Oil regions
- **Challenge:** Battery replacement expensive, weather unreliable (ice), deployments fail due to power
- **Market Size:**
  - Global ocean observation: $6-10 billion annually
  - SAM (surface buoys, acoustic/RF gateway nodes, smart moorings): 15-25%
  - Target: 5-10 organizations, 50-500 devices
- **Broader opportunity:** IoT device manufacturers (RF energy harvesting almost there commercially)

**Michael's Comment:** Asked about BMS technologies and machine learning for battery lifetime management; confirmed they use old-fashioned approaches.

### Team 7 — Fisheries Camera/ML Analysis (Gene)

**Project:** Camera + machine learning for catch analysis in fisheries (replacing at-sea observers)  
**Triggers:**
1. Underwater cameras becoming cost-effective
2. Observers becoming rare/expensive — fisheries cancelling trips because they can't finance observers

**Customer Segments Explored:**
- Aquaculture/sea farmers
- Long-line fisheries
- Regulatory monitoring companies
- Freshwater fisheries
- Salmon farms (sea lice problem — entire crop killed)

**Key Insight on Regulators:** "If you show the technology has potential, if you show you have a fisheries partner willing to test, and there's proof it works to some extent — they're open for conversation."

**Carol's Left-Field Question:** Would underwater video analysis work for swimmers/triathletes? (Triathletes spend $18K on bikes, $500 on goggles — gap in swim coaching video analysis)

---

### Team 4 — Coastal Pollution Monitoring (Kwame)

**Project:** Monitoring coastal areas for pollutants (micro/macro plastics)  
**Pivot Discovery:** Through interviews, found that people are more interested in **evacuating/removing waste** than just monitoring/detecting it — possible customer segment shift.

**Gene's Cross-Pollination:** Suggested connection to CMAR (Centre for Marine Applied Research) — 70 moorings deployed, interested in studying biofilm to understand water health; also aquaculture folks dealing with disease propagation through seeds affecting oyster populations.

---

### Team 13 — Cybersecurity for Oil & Gas Infrastructure (Ecar)

**Project:** Cyber protection for offshore O&G infrastructure  
**Key Pivot:** Repositioned questions from direct technical questions to **abuse cases** ("If this happens, what's your response? What's the impact?") — much better engagement

**Key Findings:**
- If AI model drifts → Can anomaly detection be compromised? → **Hook — people want to listen**
- Working on **dollar value** calculation per abuse case (root cause analysis of Canonical pipeline failure)
- **Repositioned target:** Instead of O&G companies directly → **service companies in the middle** (Ausparity, Weatherford) who provide threat intelligence/analytics
- Current target market estimate: ~$56M (still refining)

**Carol's Key Advice:**
> "Be mindful of the **trigger**. It seems you're going in prior to anything happening to prevent. Is there a way you can go in **afterward** — as it's happening? Bad actors holding rigs hostage, hospital data hostage — those critical moments are where a lot of money is spent. That's an opportunity."
>
> Also: Weatherford (tier one) guards data intensely — "cause for firing" to leave laptop in car. They need cyber protection too.

**Gene's Advice:** Biggest problem in cybersecurity is getting training data — "something has to go bad for you to get data." Companies are not open about sharing breach data. Suggestion: **simulate anomalies** to create training data (that's how it's being done now).
