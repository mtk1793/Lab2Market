## Slide 2: VALUE PROPOSITION STATEMENT

### Value Proposition (100 words max):

**For** offshore integrators/OEMs, defense contractors, remote utilities, and marine companies **who** struggle with 6-month spare part lead times, $30-50M tied up in physical inventory per vessel, and obsolete part crises,

**AddManuChain** is an AI-driven supply chain intelligence platform **that** replaces physical spare parts warehouses with secure, on-premise digital files ready for on-demand additive manufacturing.

**Unlike** traditional procurement or existing platforms (FieldNode, Pelagus 3D) that focus on Europe or general O&G, **we** combine predictive AI (with Engineered Intelligence partnership), marine-specific certification (DNV/ABS/Lloyd's via C-CORE), and sovereign resilience positioning for Canadian defense — **liberating working capital and reducing lead times from months to days.**

### How This Changed Since Last Sprint:

| Before (Sprint #3) | After (Sprint #4) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| "Digital inventory for AM parts" (generic) | **"Supply chain intelligence + breakdown insurance"** (specific) |
| Cost savings messaging | **Working capital liberation** as CFO-level ROI driver (Kwadwo Ampofo) |
| Target: End-user operators | **Target: Integrators/OEMs** (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes) — they decide manufacturing method (Jason Power) |
| Unknown certification pathway | **Utilities self-certify** + pre-certified parts library (Adam Chubbs, Dr. Ali Nasiri) |
| No AI integration | **Engineered Intelligence partnership** (Adam Chubbs - closed-loop AI + digital inventory) |
| No quantitative data | **$30-50M inventory per vessel** (Jason Power) + **$4-5M for $50M utility** (Adam Chubbs) |
| Unknown competitive landscape | **Fieldnode = #1 threat** (live with ConocoPhillips, Equinor, Shell, BP) — David Waldbillig |

### Key Insight:
> **"We PIVOTED from targeting operators to targeting INTEGRATORS. End users don't decide manufacturing methods — integrators do. One integrator partnership = access to entire operator customer base."**
> — Jason Power (Noble/Valaris, Interview #4)

## Slide 6: HYPOTHESIS TEST #1 — Certification Barrier

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Customer Segment** | Offshore operators, utilities, defense contractors, integrators/OEMs |
| **# of Interviews** | 14 |
| **Industry** | Ocean/Marine, O&G, Utilities, Defense |

### Hypothesis:
*"We believe that certification requirements (CSA/UL, DNV/ABS/Lloyd's Register) are a PROHIBITIVE barrier that prevents AM adoption in regulated industries, requiring 2+ years per part."*

### Status: ✅ VALIDATED — But LOWER barrier than expected

### Learnings or Insights:
- **86 certification templates** required at Atlantic XL — massive documentation burden (John Lidstone, Interview #6)
- **4-year Lloyd's Register process** ongoing at Atlantic XL — started 2022 (John Lidstone)
- **ASTM standards outdated** — "Don't have full proof validation pathways" (John Lidstone)
- **BUT: Utilities self-certify** — "We don't look for that sticker" (Adam Chubbs, Interview #30) ⭐
- **Pre-certified parts library** — "Tronosjet certified laser part can be reproduced without re-certifying" (Dr. Ali Nasiri, Interview #11) ⭐
- **Temporary parts accepted** — Navy validated concept (Jim Granger, Interview #23), Clearwater Seafoods actively using plastic AM (Interview #12)
- **Facility-level qualification** possible — Lloyd's Register (Atlantic XL expected within 2 weeks)

> **Quote:** *"We don't have to buy CSA certified equipment... we certified our own... we don't look for that sticker on the equipment."* — Adam Chubbs (Frobisher Energy)

### Next Steps:
- **Partner with C-CORE** (Mike Paulin) for marine certification pathway (DNV/ABS/Lloyd's)
- **Target self-certifying customers FIRST** (utilities, offshore platforms in non-public environments)
- **Build pre-certified parts library** — start with 10-20 common offshore parts
- **Use temporary parts** as market entry strategy (bypass 2-year certification for initial traction)

## Slide 7: HYPOTHESIS TEST #2 — OEM IP is Critical Blocker

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Customer Segment** | OEMs, AM service providers, platform operators, integrators |
| **# of Interviews** | 10 |
| **Industry** | Manufacturing, O&G, Marine, Defense |

### Hypothesis:
*"We believe that OEM intellectual property (IP) release is a critical blocker for digital inventory platforms, and companies will not upload part designs to cloud-based systems."*

### Status: ✅ STRONGLY VALIDATED

### Learnings or Insights:
- **"People hide behind IP"** — Chris, OMV Austria (Interview #18)
- **15 years at GE — IP is non-negotiable** (Jim Granger, Interview #23)
- **"Raspberry Pi local hardware, no cloud uploads"** — Assembly Studio (Interview #20)
- **On-premise processing required** — validated by Nicole Rathie (NGen, Interview #14), Jim Granger, Assembly Studio
- **AI-powered patent search** could automate IP clearance — check expired/void patents (John Lidstone, Interview #6)
- **OEM relationships = THE bottleneck** for competitors FieldNode and Pelagus 3D (Sean Morgan, Interview #5; John Lidstone, Interview #6)
- **Canada Makes Select AM tool** working on same problem (Frank DeFalco, Interview #8) — partnership opportunity

> **Quote:** *"Working with OEMs seems to be a blocker for them currently."* — John Lidstone (Atlantic XL, on FieldNode/Pelagus 3D)

### Next Steps:
- **Design on-premise architecture** (no cloud uploads — validated by 4+ interviews)
- **Explore expired patent strategy** — build digital inventory from PUBLIC DOMAIN parts first
- **Position as OEM enabler**, not disruptor — white-label solution OEMs can co-brand
- **Partner with Canada Makes** (not compete) — complement their Select AM tool

## Slide 8: HYPOTHESIS TEST #3 — Post-COVID Supply Chain & Inventory Quantification

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Customer Segment** | Utilities, offshore operators, distributors, integrators |
| **# of Interviews** | 10 |
| **Industry** | Utilities, O&G, Distribution, Manufacturing, Offshore Drilling |

### Hypothesis:
*"We believe that companies tie up significant working capital (5-10% of assets) in physical spare parts inventory, and post-COVID supply chain disruption has made this problem worse."*

### Status: ✅ STRONGLY VALIDATED — First Quantitative Data

### Learnings or Insights:
- **$30-50M inventory per offshore drilling vessel** valued at $500M-$1B — 5-10% ratio (Jason Power, Interview #4) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **$500K-$1M/day drilling downtime** makes inventory hoarding rational (Jason Power) ⭐⭐⭐
- **$4-5M inventory for $50M utility** — 8-10% inventory-to-asset ratio (Adam Chubbs, Interview #30) ⭐⭐⭐
- **$100K per transformer**, $200K per turbo + preservation costs (Adam Chubbs)
- **5% transformer spare ratio** (of fleet in stock)
- **10% of inventory = 90% of cost** (Pareto principle — Adam Chubbs)
- **N+2 redundancy required** for remote mining (diamond/gold mines) — highest cost (Adam Chubbs)
- **Post-COVID: "Nobody carries stock anymore, everything pre-ordered"** (Sean Morgan, Interview #5) ⭐⭐⭐
- **Companies invested in Canadian manufacturing during COVID → hospitals went back to China → Canadian manufacturers went bankrupt** (Frank DeFalco, Interview #8)
- **$1M/year Onstream case study** — titanium AM parts for pipeline inspection (Frank DeFalco, Interview #8) ⭐
- **10-day emergency delivery** for motor to Central Newfoundland (Darren Wood, Interview #29)
- **6-month valve wait times** causing massive production losses (OMV Austria, Interview #18)
- **Boom/bust dynamics**: In boom, cost doesn't matter (speed = value); in bust, cost optimization = value (Jason Power)

> **Quote:** *"It fundamentally changed the supply chain. Nobody carries stock. Everything should be pre-ordered, and it's against the time."* — Sean Morgan (Atlantic XL)

> **Quote:** *"Just in time inventory is nice, but then you gotta balance that with reliability, you gotta have it, right."* — Adam Chubbs (Frobisher Energy)

### Next Steps:
- **Use $4-5M inventory data** as anchor for ROI calculator (15% ROI threshold — OMV)
- **Target N+2 redundancy customers** — highest pain, highest willingness to pay
- **Build "breakdown insurance" pitch** around inventory cost reduction
- **Create inventory cost savings model** based on 8-10% ratio across industries

## Slide 9: HYPOTHESIS TEST #4 — AI Integration as Key Differentiator

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Customer Segment** | Utilities, O&G operators, offshore, integrators/OEMs |
| **# of Interviews** | 8 |
| **Industry** | Utilities, O&G, Marine, Manufacturing, Offshore Drilling |

### Hypothesis:
*"We believe that integrating AI-driven predictive maintenance with digital inventory creates a unique competitive advantage that existing platforms lack."*

### Status: ✅ STRONGLY VALIDATED — Partnership Opportunity Identified

### Learnings or Insights:
- **Engineered Intelligence** (Adam Chubbs' company) — AI asset intelligence platform for utilities ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
  - Platform called "Engine" (e-n-g-e-I-n)
  - Predicts failures from maintenance data, weather patterns, capacity planning
  - **"Utilities have trolls of maintenance data... no one can piece it together"** — Adam Chubbs
- **"AI automatically determines: stock physical inventory vs hold digital files for on-demand printing"** — Mikhail, OMV Austria (Interview #15)
- **"Predictive maintenance is the major usage of AI... pairing with digital inventory to predict the future"** — Sean Morgan (Interview #5)
- **"Fully AI-based" inventory management** validated as desirable (Mikhail, OMV)
- **Enamcos** — digital twins for offshore subsea equipment (Adam Chubbs mention) — potential partner
- **Dr. Ali Nasiri** (Interview #11) — AI-powered visual inspection (drones + computer vision) predicts failures
- **NGen AI tools** only 65% accurate — "not good enough to go to market" (Frank DeFalco, Interview #8) — opportunity to do better
- **"No one in the business has accomplished that yet"** — integrating predictive maintenance into supply chain (Jason Power, Interview #4) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **AI for feasibility/suitability assessment** — automated "can this part be AM'd?" decision engine (Jason Power, John Lidstone) ⭐
- **David Waldbillig (InnoTech Alberta)** — AI screening for AM candidacy is a recognized need but no one has automated it

> **Quote:** *"No one in the business has accomplished [integrating predictive maintenance into supply chain] yet."* — Jason Power (Noble/Valaris)

> **Quote:** *"No one really can piece together and look at the big picture."* — Adam Chubbs (on data silos in utilities)

### Closed-Loop System:
```
AI Predicts Failure → Digital Inventory Triggered → AM Part Produced → Delivered Before Failure → Feedback Improves AI
```

### Next Steps:
- **Explore Engineered Intelligence partnership** — meet with Adam Chubbs for demo of "Engine" platform
- **Identify integration points** — API, data formats, shared customers (utilities)
- **Pilot with combined offering** — AI prediction + digital inventory + AM production
- **Position as "Supply Chain Intelligence"** not just "digital inventory"

## Slide 10: HYPOTHESIS TEST #5 — Arctic/Remote as Beachhead Market

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Customer Segment** | Remote utilities, Arctic communities, defense |
| **# of Interviews** | 5 |
| **Industry** | Utilities, Defense, Energy R&D |

### Hypothesis:
*"We believe that Arctic and remote operations represent the optimal beachhead market because geographic isolation amplifies spare parts pain and creates highest willingness to pay."*

### Status: ✅ VALIDATED — Arctic is the Beachhead

### Learnings or Insights:
- **Sealift (summer only)** from Montreal → significantly lowers cost but limited to June-September (Adam Chubbs)
- **Air freight (winter only)** — "increase your costs for freight big time" (Adam Chubbs)
- **Peak load failures in winter** = worst case scenario (highest demand + highest logistics cost)
- **N+2 redundancy required** for remote mining (diamond/gold mines) — highest inventory cost (Adam Chubbs)
- **Sovereign resilience** for remote communities — reduce dependence on southern supply chains (Keith Healey, Interview #27)
- **Bay du Nord offshore project** (Equinor) — Arctic-adjacent opportunity (Keith Healey)
- **ERINL R&D funding** — $100K-$500K available for Arctic/energy innovation (Keith Healey)
- **"Customers all over the place, none near big centres"** (Darren Wood, Interview #29)
- **10-day emergency delivery** to Central Newfoundland (Darren Wood) — AM could cut to hours/days

> **Quote:** *"If there's a major failure in winter time, which is peak load, most communities in the north, the only option you have is to fly it in which increases your costs for freight big time."* — Adam Chubbs (Frobisher Energy)

### Value Proposition for Arctic:
- **On-site AM eliminates air freight** — year-round production capability
- **N+2 → N+1 redundancy** with digital inventory backup — reduces inventory costs
- **Sovereign resilience** — reduce dependence on foreign/southern supply chains

### Next Steps:
- **Pursue ERINL R&D funding** ($100K-$500K) with Keith Healey
- **Develop Arctic pilot proposal** — remote community utility as test case
- **Build sovereign resilience pitch** for defense/government applications
- **Map Arctic utility customers** through Adam Chubbs (Frobisher Energy) connections

## Slide 12: PLAN FOR SPRINT #5

### Next Hypotheses to Test:

| # | Hypothesis | Stakeholder | Questions |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Integrator/OEM partnership:** We believe that targeting integrators (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes) instead of end-user operators will provide faster market access and higher adoption. | **Mid-size OEM/integrator** (via Jason Power network) | • Who decides which manufacturing method is used for spare parts?<br>• Would you consider AM as an alternative for low-volume parts (<50 units)?<br>• What IP constraints exist on sharing part designs?<br>• Would a per-print royalty model be acceptable?<br>• What's your current obsolete part strategy? |
| 2 | **Poly Unity (ecosystem partnership):** We believe that partnering with Poly Unity (AM ecosystem gatekeeper in Atlantic Canada) will provide faster market access than direct customer acquisition. | **Mark Gillingham** — Owner & President, Poly Unity / Atlantic Manufacturing Consortium | • How does Poly Unity position itself vs. other AM providers?<br>• Would you be interested in a digital inventory layer on top of your AM capabilities?<br>• What do your customers ask for most that you can't currently provide?<br>• How do you handle certification for your AM parts?<br>• Would a predictive AI + digital inventory partnership interest you? |
| 3 | **Kraken Robotics (pilot customer):** We believe that marine R&D companies (custom AUV parts, rapid prototyping) are ideal first pilot customers because they need one-off custom parts with fast turnaround. | **Robert Hines** — Kraken Robotics (via Darren Wood referral) | • What parts do you currently struggle to source or manufacture?<br>• How many custom one-off parts do you need per year?<br>• What's your current lead time for custom parts?<br>• Would a digital parts catalog with on-demand AM be valuable?<br>• What would a $25-50K pilot project look like for you? |
| 4 | **Engineered Intelligence (AI integration):** We believe that integrating predictive AI with digital inventory creates a closed-loop system that is uniquely valuable — no competitor offers this. | **Adam Chubbs** — Co-owner, Engineered Intelligence / Frobisher Energy / Ecotex | • Can we demo the "Engine" platform and identify integration points?<br>• What data formats/APIs does your platform use?<br>• Which utility customers would benefit from combined AI + digital inventory?<br>• What's the timeline for a joint pilot?<br>• How do you envision the business model for a combined offering? |
| 5 | **ERINL R&D funding (government validation):** We believe that government R&D funding (ERINL $100K-$500K) can de-risk our platform development and validate our approach for commercial customers. | **Keith Healey** — ERINL / **Nicole Rathie** — NGen | • What's the ERINL application process and timeline?<br>• What type of projects get funded ($100K-$500K range)?<br>• Can we position this as Arctic/energy innovation?<br>• What industry partners need to be involved?<br>• How does ERINL funding connect to Equinor/ExxonMobil? |
| 6 | **Power generation market:** We believe that power generation (gas turbines, power plants) represents an underserved AM market with high potential. | **Power generation operators** (via David Waldbillig insight) | • What percentage of spare parts become obsolete annually?<br>• How do you currently handle obsolete or discontinued parts?<br>• Would a digital inventory approach work for turbine components?<br>• Who decides manufacturing methods — plant operator or OEM? |

### Sprint #5 Execution Plan:
