## 1. WHERE WE STOOD AT WEEK 7 — Sprint #4 Summary

The Week 7 presentation captured 6 major pivots made during Sprint #4 (Feb 11–17):

| Before Sprint #4 | After Sprint #4 | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Customer:** End-user operators | **Customer:** Integrators/OEMs (HMH, NOV, Baker Hughes) | Jason Power: operators don't decide manufacturing methods |
| **Value prop:** Cost savings | **Value prop:** "Breakdown insurance" + "Working capital liberation" | Adam Chubbs, Kwadwo Ampofo |
| **Messaging:** Innovation-focused | **Messaging:** Reliability + sovereign resilience | Lee Vessey (Defense), Keith Healey (ERINL) |
| **Certification:** Assume 2+ year barrier | **Certification:** Self-certifying customers FIRST | Adam Chubbs: "We don't look for that sticker" |
| **AI:** Nice-to-have feature | **AI:** Core differentiator (Engineered Intelligence partnership) | Adam Chubbs |
| **Scope:** Digital inventory platform | **Scope:** Supply chain intelligence + breakdown insurance | Paul Blemer (Interview #41) |

**Sprint #4 metrics:** 30+ total interviews, 120+ network contacts, 87 new CRM additions, 8 warm referrals unlocked, 15+ quantitative data points collected.

**Paul Blemer's critical warning (Interview #41):**
> *"We must build a platform that handles certification complexity FOR the customer — not just provide digital files and hope they figure it out."*

## 2. THE THREE BREAKTHROUGH INTERVIEWS — Feb 18, 2026

On February 18, three high-value interviews took place in a single day:
- **Interview #42:** Lloyd's Register — Trevor Butler, Adam Saxty, Dave Whitehouse (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- **Interview #43:** GKN Aerospace — Matthew Erning (⭐⭐⭐)
- **Interview #44:** Equinor — Douglas Garcia-Golindano (⭐⭐⭐)

Together they answer three critical open questions:
1. **HOW does certification actually work?** → Lloyd's Register (#42)
2. **Is aerospace the right entry market?** → GKN Aerospace (#43)
3. **What's the real ROI framing?** → Equinor (#44)

---

## 3. PIVOT #1: CERTIFICATION IS MANAGEABLE — NOT A SINGLE WALL

### What We Used to Believe
Certification = a monolithic, multi-year barrier blocking every part.

### What Lloyd's Register Actually Told Us (Interview #42)

Adam Saxty (LR Lead AM Technologist, UK) mapped the full 7-step AM certification process:

1. **Design Review** — part suitability for application
2. **Material Specification** — custom spec per part (no universal AM material standards yet)
3. **Facility Qualification** — personnel, machines, CAD-to-machine translation (**done ONCE per facility**)
4. **Feedstock Qualification** — powder reuse tracking, batch consistency
5. **Part Qualification** — prototype build + destructive testing
6. **Production Certification** — test coupons built alongside actual parts
7. **Installation Approval** — documentation complete → part certified → installed

**Trevor Butler's game-changing clarification:**
> *"You don't have to go through all that qualification process every single time. That should, I would think, be a prerequisite to being included in a digital inventory."*
> — Trevor Butler, Lloyd's Register

### The Revised Certification Model

| Action | Frequency | Who Does It |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Facility qualification | **ONCE** per facility | AddManuChain + partner facility (Atlantic XL) |
| Part design review + qualification | **ONCE** per part design | AddManuChain + LR |
| Production print + test coupon | **Every order** | Facility |
| Installation approval | **Every order** | Operator |

> **Pivot:** The barrier is front-loaded, not recurring. Our pre-certified parts library model is **fully validated by Lloyd's Register themselves**.

### Two Separate Certification Tracks Discovered

- **Marine:** LR Rules — stricter, more prescriptive
- **Offshore:** Application/international standards — more flexible
- **Platform implication:** Need two distinct certification pathways, not one

---

## 4. PIVOT #2: ATLANTIC XL IS OUR ANCHOR PARTNER — ACT NOW

**Unexpected disclosure from Trevor Butler (Lloyd's Register, Interview #42):**

> *"We have delivered to them — just a few days ago, last week — their facility qualification certificate for their additive manufacturing facility. It's the first AM facility we've qualified in North America — well, North and South America actually."*
> — Trevor Butler, Lloyd's Register

| Fact | Significance |
|------|-------------|
| Atlantic XL (St. John's, NL) is LR-qualified | Only certified AM facility in the entire Americas |
| LR is actively working with them | Warm introduction path available via Trevor |
| Located in St. John's | Heart of target market (Hibernia, Hebron, Bay du Nord) |
| Still need to certify individual parts | First-mover opportunity: co-develop the parts library |

**This single fact changes our go-to-market:**
- We no longer need to build manufacturing capability from scratch
- We have an LR-certified production partner in our backyard
- Atlantic XL + AddManuChain + Lloyd's Register = the full certification stack, already assembled

> **Pivot:** Stop treating manufacturing capability as a future problem. Atlantic XL is ready NOW. Partner immediately.

---

## 5. PIVOT #3: FIELDNODE IS THE PRIMARY COMPETITOR — OUR DIFFERENTIATION IS CLEAR

Trevor explicitly named FieldNode in the meeting and put a link in the chat:

> *"In my mind, FieldNode already has this. It does all these things, or at least it's supposed to. I don't know if you're aware of FieldNode — certainly something to evaluate from your end."*
> — Trevor Butler, Lloyd's Register

### Our Articulated Differentiation (validated by LR):

| FieldNode | AddManuChain |
|-----------|-------------|
| Software connector only | **Certified production platform** |
| No certification layer | **We handle certification end-to-end** |
| European-focused (Equinor/Shell/BP) | **Canada-first, sovereign resilience** |
| No on-site enablement | **Helps operators equip themselves** |
| Sells connectivity | **Sells trust** |

Alireza's home printer analogy — validated by Trevor as a genuine differentiator:
> *"Many years ago, no one had paper printers at home. Now everyone has one... I help the part end users evaluate their parts, find the right technology, equip themselves — and then get connected to OEMs via digital inventory."*

Trevor's response: *"That's interesting. I would agree for sure."*

## 6. PIVOT #4: THE NAVY ANGLE IS LARGER THAN EXPECTED

Dave Whitehouse (LR Naval/Defense, Interview #42) provided the most powerful Navy use case in the entire discovery process:

### The Submarine Case Study — Use This in Every Navy Pitch:
> *"For the current submarines, they're all custom, all 4 built slightly differently. Their certification requires — if you replace a part — it must be installed as-built. So they're going down the route of having things custom manufactured. But why are you putting an as-built part in when you may only need it for 10 years? Vessels that are 20-30 years old, with only 5-10 years of life left."*
> — Dave Whitehouse, Lloyd's Register

### Canadian Navy Availability Numbers:
- Current ship availability: **30-50%**
- Navy target: **70-80%**
- Achieving this requires modernizing maintenance processes
- **AM + digital inventory = direct path to availability improvement**

### Dave's AOR/JSS Insight (New):
On-site AM on combat ships is still difficult (vibration, motion, environment). Better model:
- **AOR/JSS vessels** (Auxiliary Oiler Replenishment / Joint Support Ships) — already designed for containerized modules
- These service ships could host certified AM facilities supporting the combat fleet
- **This is the correct naval architecture for our go-to-market**

### Dave's Arctic / DND Framing:
> *"The Arctic aspect always looks really good if you have that in your proposal on something to DND."*
> — Dave Whitehouse, Lloyd's Register

---

## 7. PIVOT #5: AEROSPACE PRODUCTION IS THE WRONG MARKET — CONFIRMED

### The GKN Aerospace Reality Check (Interview #43)

Matthew Erning (GKN Aerospace Technical Authority, DED) provided a critical correction:

**What's actually certified in aerospace:**
> *"Typically, you don't have individual parts that are certified. Platforms are certified — for example, Boeing certifies the 737."*
> — Matthew Erning, GKN Aerospace

**Regulations are NOT the barrier in aerospace:**
> *"The FAA and EASA have made it very clear that the regulations are process and material agnostic — no special considerations for AM."*
> — Matthew Erning

**The REAL aerospace certification barrier — the MMPDS Gap:**
> *"The problem with additive right now is those [material databases] don't exist. For conventional machining, you go to the MMPDS — the Bible of material performance. You pull out Ti-64 data. It doesn't exist for additive manufacturing."*
> — Matthew Erning

| Market | Digital Inventory Relevance | Strategic Fit |
|--------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Civilian aviation production** | ❌ Low — planned, predictable production | ❌ Wrong market |
| **Aerospace MRO** | 🟡 Medium — repair/replacement parts | 🟡 Possible secondary |
| **Defense aerospace** | ✅ High — unpredictable demand | ✅ Right market |

### The FAA PMA Pathway — Confirmed (New Knowledge)

Matthew validated the pre-certified parts library concept from the aerospace angle:
- **FAA PMA** (Part Manufacturing Approval) = the aerospace pathway for certified replacement/aftermarket parts
- Matthew achieved this at Tronosjet PEI for a metal AM part
- Once PMA-approved for AM, parts can be reproduced without full re-certification
- **This is the aerospace equivalent of our pre-certified parts library** — the concept holds across industries

### IP Connectivity Barrier in Aerospace:

> *"We would never want our customers to have direct access to our data... we don't want them to take our knowledge and shift it to another location."*
> — Matthew Erning

**But defense mandates can override this:**
> *"If the US DoD says we want full uplink to our suppliers — Lockheed Martin — and that flows down to companies like GKN — we'll just get on board."*
> — Matthew Erning

> **Pivot:** Don't sell to aerospace Tier-1 manufacturers. Sell to **defense procurement bodies** (DND, PSPC) who can mandate connectivity down the supply chain.

## 8. PIVOT #6: THE ROI FRAMING JUST GOT 10X MORE POWERFUL

### Equinor's "1-2% Protects 98%" Formula (Interview #44)

Douglas Garcia-Golindano (Equinor Midstream Asset Manager, 26 years O&G) provided the most powerful ROI framing in 44 interviews:

> *"My cost is 1 to 2% [of total capex]. If you don't have it, you can lose 98% of your production."*
> — Douglas Garcia-Golindano, Equinor

### The Cascading Shutdown Economics:
1. **Midstream:** Shutoff valve fails → pipeline shuts down
2. **Upstream:** Pipeline shutdown → production stops
3. **Wells:** Shutting a well damages it → costs millions to re-drill → months to recover
4. **Downstream:** Hydrocracker fails → refinery shuts → storage fills → upstream must stop again

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spare parts as % of capex | **1–2%** | Douglas (Equinor) |
| Production value at risk | **98%** | Douglas (Equinor) |
| Critical part lead times | **10–18 months** | Douglas (Equinor) |
| Well re-drill cost (after shutdown damage) | **Millions** | Douglas (Equinor) |
| Well recovery time | **Months** | Douglas (Equinor) |

**New pitch framing (replace all previous ROI slides):**
> *"Your spare parts budget is 1-2% of capex. Without it, you lose 98% of production. What if you could guarantee those parts in hours instead of 18 months?"*

### LEAN Optimization Has Backfired — A New Angle:

> *"I have heard producers that have been hurt. Because they try to minimize cost of stores... and then you have an atomic bomb of a string die."*
> — Douglas Garcia-Golindano, Equinor

**New positioning for LEAN practitioners:**
> *"Digital inventory is the ultimate LEAN tool for spare parts — eliminate physical waste WITHOUT eliminating availability. JIT manufacturing, not JIT gambling."*

---

## 9. PIVOT #7: EQUINOR IS FURTHER AHEAD THAN WE ASSUMED — AND THAT HELPS US

Douglas revealed Equinor's current state of AI/robotics deployment:

> *"We have deployed robots — spare parts from one platform to another, without any man assistant. Everything from shoreline. Your AI robot will immediately do a scanning of the whole system and say, 'On this field, we have that part that may be missing here, but we need to swap.' And then unmanned helicopter, taking the part from one side to another."*
> — Douglas Garcia-Golindano, Equinor

| Company | Technology Today |
|---------|----------------|
| **Equinor** | AI-driven scanning + unmanned helicopter parts delivery between platforms |
| **TotalEnergies (Argentina)** | 100% unmanned offshore platforms, remote from shore |
| **ExxonMobil (Guyana)** | 40-45% fewer crew on FPSOs due to AI/technology |

**This is our narrative bridge:**
> *"You've already automated how you MOVE parts. AddManuChain automates how you MAKE them."*

---

## 10. BAY DU NORD — THE SINGLE BEST TARGET PROJECT IN CANADA

Douglas Garcia-Golindano (Equinor) confirmed Bay du Nord specifics:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Distance from shore** | ~500 km |
| **Project cost** | $14 billion CAD |
| **Final Investment Decision** | Expected 2027 |
| **First production** | 2030–2033 |
| **Conditions** | Harsher than Norwegian Sea |
| **Spare parts strategy** | Being designed NOW (pre-FID) |

> **Strategic window:** The Bay du Nord spare parts strategy is being designed right now, before FID in 2027. This is a greenfield opportunity to embed digital inventory from day one — not retrofit it later.

**Combined with Tyler Beatty data (Interview #33):** ExxonMobil and Equinor are both investing in NL AM infrastructure (ExxonMobil's $17.5M Memorial SMART Lab + Bay du Nord local content requirements). AddManuChain is positioned at the intersection of both.
