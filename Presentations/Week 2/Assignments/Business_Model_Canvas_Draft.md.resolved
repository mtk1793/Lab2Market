### ⑤ Revenue Streams

**How do we make money? What's the revenue model? Pricing tactics?**

| **Revenue Stream** | **Model** | **Price Point** | **Justification** |
|-------------------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Enterprise SaaS License** | Annual subscription | $100K-$250K/year | Access to dashboard and analytics platform |
| **Per-Asset Monitoring Fee** | Usage-based | $10K/asset/year | Scales with number of monitored platforms/ships |
| **Installation & Setup** | One-time | $50K-$100K | Sensor deployment and integration with existing systems |
| **Premium Support** | Annual subscription | $25K/year | 24/7 monitoring center + dedicated account manager |
| **Data Insights Package** | One-time reports | $10K-$50K/report | Custom analytics for specific operations challenges |

**Total Annual Contract Value (ACV)**: $150K-$400K per customer

**Pricing Anchor**: Manual compliance prep costs $200K+/year in labor; equipment downtime = $2M+/incident

**Hypothesis to Test**:
- Is annual subscription preferred over monthly?
- Will they pay per-asset or prefer flat enterprise fee?

## Summary: Key Hypotheses to Validate

### Riskiest Assumptions (Test These First!)

1. **Pain Intensity**: Do offshore operators rate equipment downtime as an 8+/10 problem?
   - **Test**: Ask "On a scale of 1-10..." in first 10 interviews
   - **Threshold**: 8/10 must say "8 or higher"

2. **Willingness to Pay**: Will they pay $150K+/year for this solution?
   - **Test**: Show pricing slide in interviews 11-20
   - **Threshold**: 7/10 say "this is in our budget range"

3. **Decision Authority**: Can we identify the buyer in 6 months?
   - **Test**: Ask "Who signs off on technology purchases like this?"
   - **Threshold**: Can map decision chain in 8/10 interviews

4. **Channel Preference**: Do they want to buy direct or through existing vendors?
   - **Test**: Ask "How do you typically purchase monitoring systems?"
   - **Threshold**: Clear pattern emerges by interview 30

5. **Class Society Partnership**: Will DNV/ABS partner with us?
   - **Test**: Set up exploratory meetings with 2-3 class societies by Week 6
   - **Threshold**: 1+ expresses serious interest in collaboration

## Next Steps

1. **Print this canvas** (or use a large whiteboard)
2. **Color-code each box**:
   - 🟢 Green = Validated (evidence from 8+ interviews)
   - 🟡 Yellow = Partially validated (some evidence, needs more)
   - 🔴 Red = Invalidated (need to pivot)
   - ⚪ White = Not yet tested (still a guess)
3. **Update weekly** based on interview findings
4. **Share with team** for alignment

**Remember**: This entire canvas is a HYPOTHESIS. Expect 50%+ of it to change after your first 30 interviews.
