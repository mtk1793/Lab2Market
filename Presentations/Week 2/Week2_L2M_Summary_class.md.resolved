## 1. Program Foundations & Expectations

### Why Are You Here?
Common participant goals:
- "Take my innovation from pilot phase to viable product"
- "Build a network with individuals who share innovative ideas"
- "Validate our solution with actual customers and get feedback"
- "Refine our business model; validate our market approach"

### About Lab2Market
*"Lab2Market is a national program in Canada to equip graduate students and their faculty supervisors with the entrepreneurial skills needed to assess the [commercial] viability of their university-based research."*

### Core Program Objectives

#### 1. **Assessment of Your Idea**
- Is there a real, profitable business here?
- Does the market actually want this?
- Can this scale beyond a pilot project?

#### 2. **Classes as Labs**
- Lectures and materials are **tools, not answers**
- You must apply, test, and validate everything yourself
- Experiential learning > Passive consumption

#### 3. **Startup Pressure Simulation**
- Expect **long days**
- Expect **iterations and pivots**
- Expect **failure** (which equals learning)
- Work at "startup tempo" with urgency

#### 4. **Full Immersion**
- **10 weeks full-time** (Orientation + Core Program)
- Majority of time spent **outside your research community** (comfort zone)
- Work as a cohesive team: EL + TL + Mentor

### Critical Rule
**Always check your initial application/assumptions at the beginning, then compare them with your final results.** This reflection is key to understanding what you've learned and where your pivot points were.

## 2. Research vs. Innovation Mindset

### The Fundamental Shift

| **Research** | **Innovation (L2M)** |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Direction**: Money → Knowledge | **Direction**: Knowledge → Money |
| **Output**: Papers, Grants, Theses | **Output**: Revenue, Customers, Profit |
| **Process**: Hypothesis → Data → Analysis → Verify/Falsify | **Process**: Hypothesis → Customer Discovery → Validate/Falsify → Pivot/Persevere |
| **Success Metric**: Publications, Citations | **Success Metric**: Product-Market Fit, Revenue |

### What About My Research?
- **Research IS critical** to your startup—it's part of your value proposition
- **BUT**: Customers don't care about your research. They care about **solving their problem**.
- **Example**: Mariners don't want "advanced marine radar technology"; they want to "navigate safely in all conditions."

### The Commercialization Mindset
- **Don't forget to commercialize** your work
- The business plan is the **profitable part**
- Research is the **pillar** of making any startup, but it's not the whole building

---

## 3. The Blue Economy Context

### The "3 E's" of the Ocean
1. **Economically**: Massive global market (estimated in trillions)
2. **Environmentally**: Critical for climate, biodiversity, oxygen production
3. **Emotionally**: Deep cultural and personal connections to the sea

### Ocean Challenges = Ocean Opportunities
- **Unique, harsh environment** = Unique, challenging problems
- **High stakes** (safety, environmental impact) = Willingness to pay for solutions
- The ocean is **more challenging than outer space** in many ways (pressure, corrosion, accessibility)

### The Mariner Mindset
> "Mariners are, by necessity, conservative—NOT luddites, but very cautious/careful."

#### Their Top 4 Priorities (in order):
1. **Safety** (nothing matters if you're dead)
2. **Efficiency** (fuel, time, crew costs)
3. **Profit** (the business must survive)
4. **Environmental Sustainability** (social license to operate)

### Navigating "The Commons"
- **The Commons**: Shared resources where each stakeholder has an equal interest
- All ocean enterprise operates under a **"social license"**
- **Regulators** are key stakeholders
- **Regulatory framework** is both a challenge and an opportunity

#### Regulations as Opportunities
- Regulations create **barriers to entry** for competitors
- If you solve a **regulatory pain point**, you have a captive market
- **Example: Rutter Company**
  - Specializes in ice navigation and weather monitoring systems
  - Regulations require vessels in ice-prone waters to have certified navigation aids
  - Rutter's technology meets regulatory standards → Competitive moat

### What is "Ocean" Technology?
- **Direct**: Marine radar, sonar, underwater robotics
- **Adjacent**: Technologies developed for ocean use but applicable elsewhere
- **Remember**: Sometimes your startup's application extends **beyond** the ocean sector

## 4. Team Roles & Dynamics

### Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) - The Hustler
Your role is multifaceted:

1. **Scheduler**: Organize team meetings; communicate when you need others and why
2. **Marketer**: Spread the word about what you're doing and why it matters
3. **Customer Service Rep**: Lead the Customer Discovery process (interviews)
4. **Grunt**: Do whatever needs to be done, when it needs to be done

**Critical Mindset**: Think about what's best for **the startup**, not your personal preferences.

### Technical Lead (TL) - The Expert
- **Deep understanding** of the science/technology and latest developments
- Typically more **theoretical than practical**
- Answers: *"Is that scientifically/technically feasible?"*
- Can secure **additional funding/students** for further R&D
- Maintains a **network of field experts**

### Mentor - The Advisor
- People with **real-world experience** in startups/industry
- Role:
  - Help you "get out of the laboratory"
  - **Share contacts** (invaluable)
  - Offer real-world entrepreneurial advice
  - Give **critical, "brutal" feedback** (this is a gift!)
- **Rule**: You arrange your schedule around **mentor availability**, not the other way around

### Managing Team Dynamics
- **Schedule weekly team meetings** + frequent updates (phone/text/email)
- **Ask your team** what they're thinking, feeling, experiencing
- **Be transparent** about your own thoughts and feelings
- **Avoid "right-wrong" or "all-or-nothing" thinking** → Find compromise
- **COMMUNICATE, COMMUNICATE, COMMUNICATE**

#### Planning Matters
- Always ask your team for their thoughts before making decisions
- **Consider startup needs before yours**

---

## 5. The Lean Startup Framework

### Core Definition
**Startup**: A temporary organization with a mandate to **search** for a repeatable and scalable business model [Function: Validate assumptions]

**Company**: A business organization which **executes** a proven business model [Function: Deliver product/service for revenue]

### The Three Pillars

#### 1. Business Model (The "Guess")
Your core assumptions and hypotheses about:
- Who your customers are
- What problem you solve
- How you deliver value
- How you make money

#### 2. Customer Discovery (The "Test")
A systematic way to test those hypotheses through **100 customer interviews**

#### 3. Agile Engineering (The "Build")
Iterative product development:
- Build Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Measure customer response
- Learn from data
- Repeat

### The Build-Measure-Learn Loop
```
Assumptions → Build (MVP) → Measure (Customer Feedback) → Learn (Insights) → Pivot/Persevere → Repeat
```

### Risk Reduction
Lean Startup is a **risk reduction methodology**. It prevents you from:
- Spending time/effort and getting nothing in return
- Building something nobody wants
- Running out of money before finding product-market fit

---

## 6. Customer Discovery: The 100-Interview Mission

### The Goal
**Conduct 100 customer interviews by March 26, 2026** to verify or falsify your hypotheses.

### The Prime Directive
![Prime Directive](C:/Users/mtk17/.gemini/antigravity/brain/1e0b7907-a400-46bb-ba66-c4ebe5cfeb5f/uploaded_image_3_1768773068945.png)

> **"Your job is to VALIDATE that a problem/need exists, UNDERSTAND who has it, and ONLY THEN decide how best to solve it."**

**You are NOT trying to educate your customers; you are trying to LEARN from them.**

### Why Startups Fail
**#1 Reason**: **42% fail because there's NO MARKET NEED**

Build something people **actually need**, not what you *think* they need.

### Fall in Love with the Problem
- **NOT** the solution
- Solutions change; problems persist
- Get their **perspective** on the problem
- Sometimes they haven't even thought about the problem before you ask
- **Stick with the early segment** of customers who feel the pain most acutely

### Problem vs. Need

| **Problem** | **Need** |
|------------|---------|
| "Must have" | "Nice to have" |
| Solves **pain** | Provides **pleasure** |
| **Required** | **Desired** |
| **Example**: "My data is constantly being stolen" | **Example**: "I'd like a prettier dashboard" |

**Your Goal**: Build a **"Must Have"**, not a "Good to Have."

### Product-Market Fit
Search for the intersection where:
- **Customer Pain/Gain** (what they want)
- **Your Value Proposition** (what you offer)
- **Align perfectly**

Use the **Value Proposition Canvas** to map this out.

---

## 7. The 5-Step Interview Protocol

### Step 1: Be Human
- **Be yourself**
- **Build community** throughout your customers
- **Know yourself**: Understand your strengths, cultural background, communication style
- **Cultural considerations**: Be aware of different communication norms
- **Be real**: Don't sound like a bot

### Step 2: Finding the Right People
**Systematically talk with one group at a time.** When you find the right people, they can:
- Validate the problem
- Validate the business model
- Test your hypothesis

#### Who Are "The Right People"?
- People who **have the problem**
- People who will **pay** to solve it
- People who have **decision-making authority**
- People in your **target customer segment**

#### How to Find Them
1. **LinkedIn**: Explore slowly and steadily; use advanced search filters
2. **Ask for referrals** (the golden ticket)
3. **Industry groups**: Check membership directories
4. **Industry conferences**: Look at speaker lists and sponsor companies
5. **Industry publications**: Authors and contributors
6. **Alumni associations**: Leverage your university network
7. **Talk with competitors**: Learn about their business model (they may share more than you think)

### Step 3: Talking to Humans
**Key principle**: You want a **conversation**, not an interrogation.

- **NOT a conversation**: Sending an email with a list of questions
- **NOT a conversation**: Rapid-fire questions without breathing
- **IS a conversation**: Following interesting threads and *their* logic, not just your script

**Never ask Yes/No questions.** Always use open-ended questions.

### Step 4: Stop Talking (LISTEN)
**The whole secret** to talking to people is really **LISTENING**.

- In a good interview, **you do 10% of the talking, they do 90%**
- Listen for "Aha!" moments
- Ask follow-up questions
- **Write things down** (or record with permission)
- Observe **body language** (theirs and yours)

### Step 5: Learn & Analyze
Put on your analytical hat. Review the conversation immediately after:

**Questions to ask yourself**:
- What worked really well?
- What didn't work so great?
- What did you forget to ask?
- What's one thing you'd try differently next time?
- What's one thing you want to absolutely keep the same?

**WRITE. IT. DOWN.** Upload to AirTable or your tracking system.

## 8. The 4-Part Interview Structure

### Part 1: The Welcome (2-3 minutes)
**Purpose**: Set expectations and build rapport.

**Script Template**:
> "Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I want to hear your thoughts on a few things relating to [industry/topic] because I'm working on a project and before we spend a lot of money on it, I want to know if the problem I want to solve exists and is important, exists but isn't so important, or doesn't exist."

> "I am only looking for your insights."

**OR**:
> "So I don't want to sell anything, but only take information and learn from you."

**Then**:
> "The interview consists of six questions... does that sound good to you?"

### Part 2: Positioning Your Customer (5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Build up their experience and make them feel valued.

- Ask them **questions about themselves**
- **Elevate them** as the expert
- Make them feel they have a lot to offer you in advice
- **Example questions**:
  - "How long have you been in this role?"
  - "What's your background in [field]?"
  - "What does a typical day look like for you?"

### Part 3: Ranking the Problem (10 minutes)
**Purpose**: Understand the problem's severity and frequency.

**Framework**: Having a problem and **knowing the cost** of the problem are different. Find the problem, then **rank it**.

**Dimensions to explore**:
1. **Frequency**: How often does it occur?
2. **Intensity**: How bad is it when it happens?

**Classification**:
- "Nice-to-have"
- "Must-have"
- "Don't want"

**Script Template**:
> "Thank you for your support. You have a wealth of experience! Now, I would like to ask you a few questions that I have put together. We may go a little deeper on some questions..."

**The 6 Core Questions**:
1. **What is the biggest challenge?**
2. **How often does it occur?** (Scale 1-10)
3. **When it occurs, how intense is it?** (Scale 1-10)
4. **How frequent does this happen?** (Scale 1-10)
5. **What makes your current solution awesome?**
6. **What makes your current solution NOT so awesome?**

### Part 4: The Hook (2-3 minutes)
**Purpose**: Establish a relationship for follow-up.

**Script Template**:
> "So I promised at the start I am not here to sell to you, but to learn from you."

> "I only want to know if you would be interested in seeing what we develop out of this when we have something ready?"

**Then ask for referrals**:
> "Also, we are looking to interview people similar to you, could you introduce me to someone who is as experienced as you are or has something to offer in our quest?"

**Finding a hook matters**: It keeps the relationship alive.

## 9. Outreach Strategy & Templates

### Strategic Planning
**Goal**: 15 completed interviews every week.

**Considerations**:
- How many invites must you send to get 15 "yes" responses? (Assume 10-20% acceptance rate = 75-150+ invites/week)
- How will you schedule and manage those?
- How will you adapt based on what's working/not working?
- How will you work through challenges?
- How will you celebrate achievements?

### Email Outreach

#### Subject Line
**Rule**: **Succinct specificity is the goal.**

**Examples**:
- "Quick question about [specific topic] from Dal PhD student"
- "15-min chat re: [industry challenge]?"
- "L2M student seeking your expertise on [topic]"

#### Email Components
![Email Structure](C:/Users/mtk17/.gemini/antigravity/brain/1e0b7907-a400-46bb-ba66-c4ebe5cfeb5f/uploaded_image_1_1768773068945.png)

1. **Greeting**: Use their name
2. **Introduction**: Who you are (use the "student card")
3. **Ask**: What you want (be specific and concise)
4. **Value Demonstration**: Why talking to you is worth their time
5. **Scheduling**: Flexibility ("I will work around your time")
6. **Sign off**: Professional but warm

**Full Email Template**:
```
Subject: 15-min chat about ice navigation challenges?

Hello [Name],

My name is [Your Name] and I'm a [degree] student at Dalhousie University currently participating in the Canadian Lab2Market program. I'm exploring how [technology/topic] is used in [their industry/role].

As the [their title] at [their company], I thought you might have some interesting experiences and insights you'd be open to sharing with me.

I want to emphasize: I'm not selling anything. I'm only looking to learn from industry experts like yourself.

Would you be available for a 15-20 minute conversation sometime in the next two weeks? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for considering,
[Your Name]
[Contact Info]
```

### Cold Call / Voice Mail Script
**Structure**: Greeting → Your Name → Ask/Value → Intro Details → Sign Off

**Example**:
> "Hello [their name], this is [your name]. I'm calling to see if you'd be available for a short chat this week or early next. I'm a University of [X] student currently in the Canadian Lab2Market program and I'm exploring how [X] is used in your line of work. As the [Y] of your organization, I thought you might have some interesting experiences you might be open to sharing with me. If you're open to a 20-minute chat, I'd really appreciate it. You can reach me at [phone] or [email]. And I'll follow up in a few days too. Thanks so much!"

### Using AI (ChatGPT, etc.)
- **Do**: Use AI for first drafts, subject line ideas, structure
- **Do**: Customize the message for each person
- **Don't**: Send raw AI output—it's obvious and impersonal
- **"Leah's Dire Warning"**: Make it real, make it YOU

### Pitching the Interview
- **Be short and sweet**: Put the ask up front
- **Be on their time**: You meet when they can
- **Be clear**: You're NOT selling anything
- **Be punctual**: 15-20 minutes is perfect
- **If referred**: Mention it! "John Smith suggested I reach out to you..."

## 10. Business Thesis & Model Canvas

### The Business Thesis
Your **"North Star" hypothesis** that guides all discovery work.

#### Template 1 (Standard)
![Business Thesis](C:/Users/mtk17/.gemini/antigravity/brain/1e0b7907-a400-46bb-ba66-c4ebe5cfeb5f/uploaded_image_2_1768773068945.png)

> **"Our [Product/Service] helps [Customer Segment(s)] who want to [Job to be done] by [Functional customer pain/gain (e.g., reducing, avoiding)] and [Social/emotional customer pain/gain (e.g., prestige, happiness, confidence)]."**

#### Template 2 (Alternate)
> **"We do X (the very specific thing you deliver) for Y (the very specific customer who values this) so they can Z (the positive outcome impossible without you), and ultimately A (the real, downstream value to them)."**

#### Example: Chart Plotter
> "Our **chart plotter** helps **ship captains** who want to **navigate safely** by **accurately tracking ship position** and **knowing sea conditions ahead** (functional) **and feeling confident in their decision-making** (emotional)."

#### Characteristics of a Good Business Thesis
- **Concise, clear, and focused**
- Describes a **customer problem/need** (not your technology)
- Describes **how** your product/service addresses it
- Guides your Business Model and Customer Discovery

**Advice**: "Use guessing and go wild." This is a **hypothesis to be tested**, not a final answer.

### The Business Model Canvas (BMC)
![Business Model Canvas](C:/Users/mtk17/.gemini/antigravity/brain/1e0b7907-a400-46bb-ba66-c4ebe5cfeb5f/uploaded_image_4_1768773068945.png)

**Purpose**: Describe how your startup creates, delivers, and captures value.

#### The 9 Building Blocks

| **Block** | **Key Questions** | **Start Here?** |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **① Value Proposition** | Which customer problems are we trying to solve? What are the key features of our product? | **✓ START** |
| **② Customer Segments** | Who are our most important customers? What are their archetypes? What job do they want us to get done? | **✓ TEST** |
| **③ Channels** | Through which channels do our customer segments want to be reached? | Guess |
| **④ Customer Relationships** | How will we get, keep, and grow customers? | Guess |
| **⑤ Revenue Streams** | How do we make money? What's the revenue model? Pricing tactics? | Guess |
| **⑥ Key Partners** | Who are our key partners? Who are our key suppliers? What are we getting from them? | Guess |
| **⑦ Key Activities** | What key activities do we require? (Manufacturing? Software? Supply Chain?) | Guess |
| **⑧ Key Resources** | What key resources do we require? (Financial, physical, IP, HR?) | Guess |
| **⑨ Cost Structure** | What are the most important costs? Fixed? Variable? | Guess |

**Strategy**:
- **Start** with Value Proposition and Customer Segments
- **Test** these two first through Customer Discovery
- Everything else is a **guess** until validated

---

## 11. Analysis & Iteration Framework

### The "Why" Ladder (5 Whys Technique)
**Purpose**: Get to the **root motivation** and emotional drivers.

![Example Interaction](C:/Users/mtk17/.gemini/antigravity/brain/1e0b7907-a400-46bb-ba66-c4ebe5cfeb5f/uploaded_image_0_1768773068945.jpg)

**Example: Meal Kit Service**
1. **Q**: "Why did you decide to start using a meal kit delivery service?"
   - **A**: "I wanted to save time during the week."
2. **Q**: "Why was saving time important to you?"
   - **A**: "I was spending too much time planning meals and grocery shopping."
3. **Q**: "Why was that a problem for you?"
   - **A**: "I felt like I didn't have enough time for other important things, like work and family."
4. **Q**: "Why is it important to have more time for work and family?"
   - **A**: "I value being productive at work and want to spend more quality time with my kids."
5. **Q**: "Why do you feel the meal kit service helps with that?"
   - **A**: "It makes me feel organized and less stressed, which improves my focus and my mood."

**Insight**: The customer isn't buying "food"; they're buying **less stress** and **better parenting time**.

### Interview Tips & Techniques

#### During the Interview
- **Use their name** frequently
- **Take your time**; don't rush
- **Don't forget to breathe**
- **Ask if you can record** (be cool if they say no)
- **Use positive words**
- **Don't say "Greetings"**; say "Hello"
- **Classic sign-offs**: "Kind regards," "Thank you," "Sincerely"

#### Focus & Behavior
- **Focus on their experience and process** (not you!)
- **Don't interrupt**, but do ask for clarification
- **Get them to tell a story** or example to illustrate a point
- **Check body language** (theirs and yours)
- **Don't get defensive**; this isn't personal
- **When in doubt, don't be funny**

#### Good Questions to Ask
- **Why?** (Ask it a lot)
  - "Why is that the process?"
  - "Why is that so important?"
  - "Why is that the goal?"
  - "Why is that a challenge?"
  - "Why is that under someone else's responsibilities?"
- **What?**
  - "What would an ideal solution look like?"
  - "What have you tried before?"
- **Who?**
  - "Who else is involved in this decision?"
  - "Who else should I talk to?"

#### The "Missed Opportunity" Question
> "Is there anything I didn't ask that you were anticipating or think I should know?"

#### Always Ask for a Referral
> "Thank you, this was a wonderful chat. Do you know of anyone else that I shouldn't miss speaking with? I'd appreciate any referrals you can share."

### Pattern Recognition
You're on the hunt for:
- **Patterns**: What do multiple customers say?
- **Perspectives**: How do different segments view the problem?
- **Problem/Solution Fit**: Does your solution actually address their pain?

### Selling Feelings, Not Products
**Key Insight**: People buy based on **emotion**, justify with **logic**.

**Emotional Drivers**:
- Stress reduction
- Prestige
- Happiness
- Confidence
- Security
- Belonging
- Achievement

**Your job**: Understand the emotional WHY, then show how your product delivers that feeling.

2. **Building strategy IS important**: Have different goals for each interview cohort
3. **Questions should be personalized** for each "right person"
4. **Just do it**: Start interviewing now, refine as you go
5. **Be ready to hear something new and BE CHANGED BY IT**
6. **Never tell them your solution**: Focus on understanding their problem
7. **Build something people MUST have**, not "nice to have"
8. **Referrals are gold**: Always ask
9. **Upload to AirTable immediately**: Fresh memories = better data
10. **Iterate constantly**: Your first thesis will be wrong—that's OK
