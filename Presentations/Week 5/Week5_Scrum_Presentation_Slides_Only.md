---

## SLIDE 4: What We Uncovered This Week

### Three Breakthrough Insights:

**INSIGHT #1: Cost/ROI is the #1 Adoption Barrier**
- 89% cite investment costs as primary barrier (PRIMA Québec, n=146)
- 55% cite ROI uncertainty
- OMV requires 15% demonstrable ROI before adoption
- *Implication:* Value proposition MUST lead with financial proof

**INSIGHT #2: Mining is a Poor Fit for Digital Inventory**
- Mining needs 1000s of identical parts, not 10s of custom parts
- Seasonality (3-week summer supply window) negates on-demand value
- Only viable use case: 'breakdown insurance' for unpredictable failures
- *Implication:* Remove mining from target segments

**INSIGHT #3: Safety > Time > Cost Priority Framework**
- In regulated industries: Safety first, then Time, then Cost (always)
- Chris (OMV): "Safety is non-negotiable"
- *Implication:* Position as 'mission assurance' not 'cost savings'

**Evidence Sources:** PRIMA Québec data, Jean-Michel Fortin, Harvey Doane, Chris OMV

---

## SLIDE 5: Why It Matters - Business Model Impact

### Three Critical Pivots:

**PIVOT #1: Value Proposition Reframe**
- FROM: "Reduce inventory costs through digital on-demand manufacturing"
- TO: "Ensure mission continuity with AI-driven breakdown insurance"
- Harvey Doane: "Sell what they're buying, not what you're selling"

**PIVOT #2: Customer Segment Refinement**
- REMOVE: Mining operations (poor fit confirmed)
- PRIORITIZE: Offshore O&G, Defense/Navy, Aerospace (satellite manufacturers)
- ADD: 'New Space' vs. 'Old Space' distinction

**PIVOT #3: Go-to-Market Strategy**
- VALIDATED: Government anchor tenant strategy (DND, Canadian Navy)
- Lee Vessey's $360K Canadian Navy project proves government de-risks platform
- Nicole Rathie (NGen): "You need a government anchor to solve the cold-start problem"

**Net Impact:** Narrowed focus, dramatically increased probability of early adoption

## SLIDE 6: Hypothesis Validation Status

| Status | Count | Key Examples |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Strongly Supported** | 12 | Certification barrier, Cost/ROI, AI integration, Safety framework |
| **Partially Supported** | 8 | Distributed manufacturing, IP protection |
| **Rejected/Reframed** | 3 | Mining fit, Digital inventory = AM only |
| **Insufficient Data** | 25 | Revenue models, pricing thresholds |
| **New This Week** | 14 | Cost/ROI, Safety priority, Sovereign resilience |

### Top 5 Strongly Supported Hypotheses:
1. **NH.7** - Certification is primary gatekeeper (5 interviews)
2. **NH.12** - Cost/ROI is #1 barrier - 89% (3 interviews)
3. **NH.15** - Safety > Time > Cost framework (2 interviews)
4. **NH.21** - Breakdown insurance positioning (3 interviews)
5. **NH.22** - Sovereign resilience for defense (1 interview, strong signal)

**Total Hypotheses Tracked:** 77

---

## SLIDE 7: Key Interview Evidence

### Most Powerful Quotes:

**LEE VESSEY (Thales, Canadian Navy):**
> "We have a $360K project with the Canadian Navy for e-inventory. Sovereign resilience—not being dependent on foreign supply chains—is the primary value proposition for defense."

**CHRIS (OMV Austria, Oil & Gas):**
> "Inventory management should be fully AI-based. If you're going to use AI, make it fully AI. We have 6-month waits for specialized valves."

**HARVEY DOANE (Maritime Launch Services, Space):**
> "Safety first, time second, cost third. That's non-negotiable in space. And sell what they're buying—don't try to convince them of a new need."

**FANNY CHARRETEUR (PRIMA Québec):**
> "Only 20% of companies in the advanced materials sector have engaged with digital transformation programs. 80% are either unaware or not ready."

---

## SLIDE 8: Next Thing We Need to Know

### RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:
> "Companies will pay a subscription fee for an AI-driven inventory decision platform before we have proof from Navy/aerospace deployments."

**Why This Is Risky:**
- OMV Austria needs 15% ROI proof + other sector adoption first
- 'Fast follower' strategy confirmed by multiple O&G contacts
- Without reference customer, commercial sales may not convert

### OUR TEST:
- **Who:** 3-5 contacts in offshore O&G (already in pipeline)
- **Method:** Present mock dashboard with hypothetical savings calculator
- **Success Threshold:** At least 2 of 5 express willingness to participate in paid pilot (not just 'interest')

### HYPOTHESIS TO TEST NEXT WEEK:
> "A paid pilot with the Canadian Navy or a defense contractor will accelerate commercial adoption by providing the proof point O&G fast-followers require."

**Test:** Confirm with Lee Vessey (Thales) whether pilot partnership is feasible within 90 days

---

## SLIDE 9: Updated Value Proposition

### BEFORE (Week 1):
> "A marketplace connecting manufacturers with certified 3D printing facilities to reduce procurement time and costs."

### AFTER (Week 5):
> "We provide **offshore operators, defense contractors, and satellite manufacturers** with an **AI-driven digital inventory and breakdown insurance platform** that **ensures mission continuity by predicting part failures and orchestrating on-demand manufacturing** so that **critical operations never stop waiting for parts.**"

### Key Evolution:
1. ✅ 'Marketplace' → 'AI-driven platform' (technology differentiation)
2. ✅ 'Reduce costs' → 'Ensure mission continuity' (outcome focus)
3. ✅ 'Manufacturers generally' → 'Offshore, defense, space' (segment specificity)
4. ✅ 'Procurement time' → 'Breakdown insurance' (emotional positioning)

**Explicitly validated by:** Lee Vessey (Thales), Mikhail Gladkikh (OMV), Harvey Doane (Maritime Launch)

## SLIDE 10: Customer Segment & Early Adopter Profile

### SEGMENT 1: DEFENSE/NAVY (Highest Priority)
- **Early Adopters:** DND procurement, Thales, L3Harris
- **Why:** Sovereign resilience mandate, government funding, less price-sensitive
- **Evidence:** Lee Vessey $360K Navy project, Nicole Rathie anchor tenant strategy
- **Decision Maker:** Program managers (not procurement)

### SEGMENT 2: OFFSHORE OIL & GAS (Second Priority)
- **Early Adopters:** Forward-looking operators (Suncor, Cenovus, OMV)
- **Why:** $500K/day downtime costs validate premium pricing
- **Caveat:** Fast-followers—need proof from other sectors first
- **Evidence:** Chris (OMV) 6-month valve wait, 15% ROI threshold
- **Decision Maker:** Operations managers with P&L responsibility

### SEGMENT 3: NEW SPACE SATELLITES (Third Priority)
- **Early Adopters:** Satellite constellation manufacturers (Galaxia, Reaction Dynamics)
- **Why:** AM-native, shorter sales cycles, innovation mindset
- **Evidence:** Harvey Doane Old Space vs. New Space distinction
- **Decision Maker:** Founders/CTOs directly

### ❌ REMOVED FROM PRIORITY:
**Mining** - Confirmed poor fit by Jean-Michel Fortin (Agnico Eagle)

---

## SLIDE 11: Purchasing Decision Stakeholder Map

### B2B Stakeholder Pentagon:

**ECONOMIC BUYER:** CFO/VP Operations (controls budget)
- Example: Senior leadership at OMV requiring 15% ROI proof

**TECHNICAL BUYER:** Engineering/Quality managers (evaluates feasibility)
- Example: Mark Kirby at MSAM evaluating certification integration

**END USER:** Procurement/Maintenance teams (daily platform users)
- Example: Operators who would input part requests

**CHAMPION:** Internal advocate who promotes solution
- Example: Lee Vessey at Thales actively evangelizing e-inventory concept

**BLOCKER:** Risk-averse stakeholders who can veto
- Example: IP protection officers (Nicole Rathie raised this concern)

**Critical Insight:** Defense/Navy has fewer blockers—government mandate overrides individual risk aversion. O&G has more blockers due to organizational inertia.

---

## SLIDE 12: This Week's Achievements

✅ **Completed 5 high-value interviews** across O&G (OMV x2), Mining (Agnico Eagle), Space (Maritime Launch), Ecosystem (PRIMA Québec)

✅ **Validated government anchor strategy** through multiple sources

✅ **Identified and rejected poor-fit segment** (mining) saving future effort

✅ **Secured 5 additional scheduled interviews** including competitor (The Assembly Studio)

✅ **Quantified adoption barriers** (89% cost, 55% ROI uncertainty, 32% workforce)

✅ **Refined value proposition** from marketplace to mission assurance platform

✅ **Created 104-contact outreach campaign** for Dr. Nasiri referrals

**Progress:** 18 of 100 Interviews Complete (18%)

## SLIDE 13: Reflection - Challenges & AHA Moments

### BIGGEST CHALLENGE:
Jean-Michel Fortin's interview forced confrontation with confirmation bias. I wanted mining to fit, but the data clearly showed otherwise.

**Lesson:** Be willing to kill your hypotheses.

### BIGGEST AHA MOMENT:
> "Sell what they're buying, not what you're selling." — Harvey Doane

Harvey's statement crystallized everything. We were selling 'digital inventory'—a concept requiring education. We should be selling 'never wait 6 months for a valve again'—a pain they already feel.

### What I Need to Improve:
- Getting more quantitative data in interviews (specific dollar amounts, not just 'expensive')
- Following up faster on warm introductions (conversion drops after 48 hours)

### What's Working Well:
- Interview quality is high—averaging 45+ minutes with senior decision-makers
- Warm introduction strategy outperforming cold outreach 8:1

---

## SLIDE 14: Next Week's Plan

### 1. INTERVIEWS (Target: 5-7)
- Complete scheduled: Nichelle (The Assembly Studio - competitor intel), Arad Gharagozli (Galaxia - space), Bachar Elzein (Reaction Dynamics - rocket propulsion with AM)
- Add: Megan Clarke, and 2-3 from Dr. Nasiri referral list

### 2. TEST RISKIEST ASSUMPTION
- Create mock dashboard/savings calculator
- Present to OMV contacts to gauge pilot interest

### 3. GOVERNMENT ANCHOR VALIDATION
- Follow up with Lee Vessey on Thales/DND pilot feasibility
- Research DND procurement process and timeline

### 4. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS
- Deep dive on The Assembly Studio's digital inventory model (direct competitor)
- Identify differentiation opportunities

**Success Metric:** At least 2 expressions of pilot interest (not just 'sounds interesting')

---

## SLIDE 15: Questions & Discussion

### Discussion Prompts:

1. **Government anchor strategy:** Is DND/Navy the right first customer? What are the risks?

2. **Competitor positioning:** The Assembly Studio in PEI is doing similar work—compete or collaborate?

3. **Pricing validation:** How do I test willingness to pay before having a product to demonstrate?
