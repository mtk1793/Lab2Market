## SLIDE 4: What We Uncovered This Week

### Visual Elements
- Key insight callout boxes with quotes
- Evidence icons (n= counts)
- Pattern vs. contradiction columns

### Speaking Script (2 minutes)

> "This week delivered **three breakthrough insights** that fundamentally reshape our value proposition.
>
> **INSIGHT #1: Cost/ROI is the #1 Adoption Barrier**
> - Evidence: Fanny Charreteur (PRIMA Québec) shared survey data from 146 organizations
> - **89% cite investment costs as primary barrier**
> - **55% cite ROI uncertainty**
> - Combined with OMV Austria requiring 15% demonstrable ROI before adoption
> - *Implication:* Our value proposition MUST lead with financial proof, not technology features
>
> **INSIGHT #2: Mining is a Poor Fit for Digital Inventory**
> - Evidence: Jean-Michel Fortin (Agnico Eagle Mines, Arctic operations)
> - Mining needs 1000s of identical parts, not 10s of custom parts
> - Seasonality (3-week summer supply window) makes on-demand AM irrelevant
> - Only viable use case: 'breakdown insurance' for unpredictable failures
> - *Implication:* Remove mining from primary target segments; focus offshore O&G and aerospace
>
> **INSIGHT #3: Safety > Time > Cost Priority Framework**
> - Evidence: Harvey Doane (Maritime Launch, space industry), Chris (OMV Austria)
> - In regulated industries, decision priority is ALWAYS Safety first, then Time, then Cost
> - Quote from Chris: 'Safety is non-negotiable. We cannot compromise on safety.'
> - *Implication:* Cost-focused value propositions fail. Position as 'mission assurance' not 'cost savings.'"

## SLIDE 5: Why It Matters - Business Model Impact

### Visual Elements
- Business Model Canvas with highlighted changes
- Before/After comparison
- Decision tree diagram

### Speaking Script (90 seconds)

> "These insights force **three critical pivots** in our business model:
>
> **PIVOT #1: Value Proposition Reframe**
> - FROM: 'Reduce inventory costs through digital on-demand manufacturing'
> - TO: 'Ensure mission continuity with AI-driven breakdown insurance'
> - Harvey Doane's lesson: 'Sell what they're buying, not what you're selling. They want mission assurance.'
>
> **PIVOT #2: Customer Segment Refinement**
> - REMOVE: Mining operations (poor fit confirmed)
> - PRIORITIZE: Offshore O&G, Defense/Navy, Aerospace (satellite manufacturers)
> - ADD: 'New Space' startups vs. 'Old Space' primes distinction
>
> **PIVOT #3: Go-to-Market Strategy**
> - VALIDATED: Government anchor tenant strategy (DND, Canadian Navy)
> - Lee Vessey's insight: His $360K Canadian Navy project proves government de-risks platform for commercial adoption
> - Nicole Rathie (NGen): 'You need a government anchor to solve the cold-start problem'
>
> **Net Impact:** These pivots narrow our focus but dramatically increase our probability of early adoption."

## SLIDE 6: Hypothesis Validation Status

### Visual Elements
| Status | Count | Key Examples |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Strongly Supported** | 12 | Certification barrier, Cost/ROI, AI integration |
| **Partially Supported** | 8 | Distributed manufacturing, IP protection |
| **Rejected/Reframed** | 3 | Mining fit, Digital inventory = AM only |
| **Insufficient Data** | 25 | Revenue models, pricing thresholds |

### Speaking Script (90 seconds)

> "Our hypothesis tracker now contains 77 hypotheses. Here's the validation status after 18 interviews:
>
> **STRONGLY SUPPORTED (12 hypotheses):**
> 1. **NH.7 - Certification is the primary gatekeeper** (5 interviews)
>    - Mark Kirby, OMV (both), Harvey Doane, Sean Morgan all confirm
> 2. **NH.12 - Cost/ROI is #1 barrier (89%)** (3 interviews)
>    - PRIMA Québec data + OMV 15% threshold
> 3. **NH.15 - Safety > Time > Cost framework** (2 interviews)
>    - Aerospace and O&G universal pattern
> 4. **NH.21 - Breakdown insurance positioning** (3 interviews)
>    - Lee Vessey, Harvey Doane, Jean-Michel Fortin all use this language
>
> **REJECTED/REFRAMED (3 hypotheses):**
> 1. **NH.13 - Mining is poor fit** (VALIDATED NEGATIVE)
>    - Jean-Michel Fortin explicitly confirmed AM doesn't match mining economics
> 2. **NH.23 - Digital inventory not uniquely AM** (REFRAMED)
>    - Mark Kirby: 'Digital files can be produced by CNC, casting, injection molding—not just AM'
>    - Implication: Platform should be manufacturing-agnostic, not AM-exclusive
>
> **Key new hypotheses added this week:** 14 new hypotheses from interviews 8-18, bringing total to 77."

## SLIDE 7: Key Interview Evidence

### Visual Elements
- Quote cards from 5 most impactful interviews
- Industry icons (oil rig, satellite, mining, defense)

### Speaking Script (2 minutes)

> "Let me share the most powerful evidence from this week's interviews:
>
> **LEE VESSEY (Thales, Canadian Navy):**
> > 'We have a $360K project with the Canadian Navy for e-inventory. Sovereign resilience—not being dependent on foreign supply chains—is the primary value proposition for defense.'
>
> - **Implication:** Government contracts validate market; 'sovereign resilience' is the language that resonates with defense.
>
> **CHRIS (OMV Austria, Oil & Gas):**
> > 'Inventory management should be fully AI-based. If you're going to use AI, make it fully AI. We have 6-month waits for specialized valves.'
>
> - **Implication:** AI automation is not a nice-to-have—it's the core differentiator. Manual systems won't be adopted.
>
> **HARVEY DOANE (Maritime Launch Services, Space):**
> > 'Safety first, time second, cost third. That's non-negotiable in space. And sell what they're buying—don't try to convince them of a new need.'
>
> - **Implication:** Reframe value prop from cost savings to mission assurance. Temporary solutions concept for emergency response.
>
> **FANNY CHARRETEUR (PRIMA Québec):**
> > 'Only 20% of companies in the advanced materials sector have engaged with digital transformation programs. 80% are either unaware or not ready.'
>
> - **Implication:** Target the 20% early adopters first. Market education is prerequisite to sales for the 80%."

## SLIDE 8: Next Thing We Need to Know

### Visual Elements
- Riskiest assumption highlighted in red
- Test design table
- Success threshold indicators

### Speaking Script (90 seconds)

> "Our riskiest assumption right now:
>
> **RISKIEST ASSUMPTION:**
> > 'Companies will pay a subscription fee for an AI-driven inventory decision platform before we have proof from Navy/aerospace deployments.'
>
> **Why this is risky:**
> - OMV Austria explicitly stated they need 15% ROI proof + other sector adoption first
> - 'Fast follower' strategy confirmed by multiple O&G contacts
> - Without a reference customer, we may not convert commercial sales
>
> **OUR TEST:**
> - **Who:** 3-5 contacts in offshore O&G (already in pipeline)
> - **Method:** Present mock dashboard with hypothetical savings calculator
> - **Success threshold:** At least 2 of 5 express willingness to participate in paid pilot (not just 'interest')
>
> **HYPOTHESIS TO TEST NEXT WEEK:**
> > 'A paid pilot with the Canadian Navy or a defense contractor will accelerate commercial adoption by providing the proof point O&G fast-followers require.'
>
> **Test:** Confirm with Lee Vessey (Thales) whether pilot partnership is feasible within 90 days."

## SLIDE 9: Updated Value Proposition

### Visual Elements
- Before/After value prop comparison
- Target customer icons
- Job-to-be-done statement

### Speaking Script (60 seconds)

> "Based on 18 interviews, our value proposition has evolved significantly:
>
> **BEFORE (Week 1):**
> > 'A marketplace connecting manufacturers with certified 3D printing facilities to reduce procurement time and costs.'
>
> **AFTER (Week 5):**
> > 'We provide **offshore operators, defense contractors, and satellite manufacturers** with an **AI-driven digital inventory and breakdown insurance platform** that **ensures mission continuity by predicting part failures and orchestrating on-demand manufacturing** so that **critical operations never stop waiting for parts.**'
>
> **Key changes:**
> 1. From 'marketplace' → 'AI-driven platform' (technology differentiation)
> 2. From 'reduce costs' → 'ensure mission continuity' (outcome focus)
> 3. From 'manufacturers generally' → 'offshore, defense, space' (segment specificity)
> 4. From 'procurement time' → 'breakdown insurance' (emotional positioning)
>
> **This value prop has been explicitly validated by:** Lee Vessey (Thales), Mikhail Gladkikh (OMV), Harvey Doane (space industry)."

## SLIDE 10: Customer Segment & Early Adopter Profile

### Visual Elements
- 3 customer segment cards with early adopter characteristics
- Priority ranking (1, 2, 3)

### Speaking Script (90 seconds)

> "Our refined customer segments and early adopter profiles:
>
> **SEGMENT 1: DEFENSE/NAVY (Highest Priority)**
> - **Early Adopter:** DND procurement, Thales, L3Harris
> - **Why:** Sovereign resilience mandate, government funding available, less price-sensitive
> - **Evidence:** Lee Vessey $360K Navy project, Nicole Rathie anchor tenant strategy
> - **Decision Maker:** Program managers, not procurement
>
> **SEGMENT 2: OFFSHORE OIL & GAS (Second Priority)**
> - **Early Adopter:** Forward-looking operators (Suncor, Cenovus, OMV) vs. traditional
> - **Why:** $500K/day downtime costs validate premium pricing
> - **Caveat:** Fast-followers—need proof from other sectors first
> - **Evidence:** Chris (OMV) 6-month valve wait, 15% ROI threshold
> - **Decision Maker:** Operations managers with P&L responsibility
>
> **SEGMENT 3: NEW SPACE SATELLITES (Third Priority)**
> - **Early Adopter:** Satellite constellation manufacturers (Galaxia, Reaction Dynamics)
> - **Why:** AM-native, shorter sales cycles, innovation mindset
> - **Evidence:** Harvey Doane Old Space vs. New Space distinction
> - **Decision Maker:** Founders/CTOs directly
>
> **REMOVED FROM PRIORITY:** Mining (confirmed poor fit by Jean-Michel Fortin)"

## SLIDE 11: Purchasing Decision Stakeholder Map

### Visual Elements
- Stakeholder pentagon diagram
- Role labels with name examples from interviews

### Speaking Script (60 seconds)

> "For B2B sales, we've mapped the stakeholder landscape:
>
> **ECONOMIC BUYER:** CFO/VP Operations—controls budget
> - Example: Senior leadership at OMV who requires 15% ROI proof
>
> **TECHNICAL BUYER:** Engineering/Quality managers—evaluates feasibility
> - Example: Mark Kirby at MSAM evaluating certification integration
>
> **END USER:** Procurement/Maintenance teams—daily platform users
> - Example: Operators who would input part requests
>
> **CHAMPION:** Internal advocate who promotes solution
> - Example: Lee Vessey at Thales actively evangelizing e-inventory concept
>
> **BLOCKER:** Risk-averse stakeholders who can veto
> - Example: IP protection officers (Nicole Rathie raised this concern)
>
> **Critical insight:** Defense/Navy has fewer blockers because government mandate overrides individual risk aversion. O&G has more blockers due to organizational inertia."

## SLIDE 13: Reflection - Challenges & AHA Moments

### Visual Elements
- Challenge/solution pairs
- Lightbulb icons for AHA moments

### Speaking Script (90 seconds)

> "**Biggest challenge this week:**
> Jean-Michel Fortin's interview forced me to confront confirmation bias. I wanted mining to be a fit, but the data clearly showed otherwise. Lesson: Be willing to kill your hypotheses.
>
> **Biggest AHA moment:**
> > 'Sell what they're buying, not what you're selling.'
>
> Harvey Doane's statement crystallized everything. We were selling 'digital inventory'—a concept that requires education. We should be selling 'never wait 6 months for a valve again'—a pain they already feel.
>
> **What I need to improve:**
> - Getting more quantitative data in interviews (specific dollar amounts, not just 'expensive')
> - Following up faster on warm introductions (conversion drops after 48 hours)
>
> **What's working well:**
> - Interview quality is high—averaging 45+ minutes with senior decision-makers
> - Warm introduction strategy is outperforming cold outreach 8:1"
