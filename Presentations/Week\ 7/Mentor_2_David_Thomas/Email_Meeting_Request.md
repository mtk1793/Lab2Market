**Subject:** Following Up on Week 7 Mentor Panel — Validating First Customer Economics

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up after the Week 7 mentor panel — your insights about demand-led innovation and customer economics have been incredibly helpful as I continue customer discovery for AddManuChain.

Your warning has been echoing in my head all week: **"You can't have a $150,000/year solution solving a $15,000/year problem."** I've been interviewing manufacturers, certification bodies, and offshore operators, and I realized I need to do a much better job validating that our solution actually creates ROI for customers.

I've also been thinking deeply about your distinction between pain and problem. Right now, many customers express the pain as "finding certified AM suppliers takes time," but I suspect the real problem runs deeper — maybe it's about supply chain resilience, regulatory risk, or business continuity concerns. I'm trying to dig deeper with each interview, but I want to make sure I'm asking the right questions.

Here's where I'm at:

- **38+ customer interviews** across manufacturers, AM facilities, labs, certification bodies, and offshore operators
- **Clear validation** that supply chain and certification integration is a real need
- **8 new hypotheses** emerging from recent conversations
- **Upcoming meetings** with Lloyd's Register and other key players that could help identify first customer

But I'm nervous that I haven't properly validated:
1. **Which customer segment** is my first customer?
2. **What are their actual economics** — is the problem valuable enough to justify the solution cost?
3. **What does the buying process look like** for that first customer?
4. **How would The Pier or Port Halifax fit** into our validation and deployment strategy?

Your work with **The Pier and demand-led innovation** is exactly the kind of validation I think we need. Would you have time in the next 2-3 weeks to discuss:

- How to properly validate first customer economics
- Whether Port Halifax or The Pier could be a pilot/validation environment
- How to test our assumptions about demand before committing to full platform build

Your philosophy — "Validate first. Build second." — is reshaping how I think about development priorities.

Looking forward to diving deeper with you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**Follow-up if no response in 48 hours:**

Hi David,

Quick follow-up on my previous note. I'm really keen to discuss how we can properly validate customer economics and identify the first customer segment before we scale development.

Let me know what works for your calendar.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
