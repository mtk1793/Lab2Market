# Week 5 Customer Discovery Report for Carol

**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Interviews Completed:** 25 (1-25)  
**Strategic Status:** MAJOR PIVOT EXECUTED

## 🎯 Executive Summary: The "Working Capital Liberation" Pivot

Carol, we have completed **25 interviews** and uncovered a fundamental shift in our value proposition. **We were wrong about storage costs being the pain point.** The real pain is **Working Capital** locked in mandatory "Insurance Stock."

**The Old Pitch (WRONG):**
> "We'll save you warehouse rent by printing parts on demand."

**The New Pitch (VALIDATED):**
> "We'll free up $4M in working capital by converting your mandatory Insurance Stock to digital files. Your CFO keeps that cash. You pay us 1-2% annual management fee."

**Why This Matters:**
- Storage costs = 6-8% of inventory value (Facilities Manager decision)
- Working capital cost = 25-30% of inventory value (**CFO decision**)
- **Insurance Stock** = Parts that sit for 10+ years "just in case" (zero inventory turns)

**Carol's Question Answered:** *"Where's the money coming from?"*  
**Answer:** CFO budget for working capital optimization, not Maintenance budget.

## 📊 The "Who Pays?" Analysis (Carol's Critical Questions)

### **Problem We're Solving:**
**Companies are bleeding 25-30% annually on inventory that never moves.** Example: $10M in spare parts inventory costs $2.5M/year in:
- Cost of capital (10%)
- Storage/warehouse (6%)
- Insurance (3%)
- Obsolescence (8%)

### **Who Has This Problem?**
1. **Tier 1 O&G Operators** (Imperial Oil, Equinor) - $50M-$200M tied up
2. **Navy/Defense** (Canadian Arctic Patrol) - $10M-$50M + sovereignty value
3. **Remote Operations** (Arctic Mining, Offshore) - High expediting costs ($50k helicopter flights)

### **How Are They Solving It Today?**
- **Physical warehouses** (rent, heat, staff)
- **"Just in case" overstocking** (buy 10 when you need 1)
- **Emergency expediting** ($5k part → $50k freight)
- **Writing off obsolete parts** (8-12% annual loss)

### **How Much Are They Paying Today?**
- **Imperial Oil scale:** $100M inventory × 25% = **$25M/year**
- **Navy scale:** $20M inventory × 30% = **$6M/year** (+ sovereignty premium)
- **Arctic Mining:** $10M inventory × 25% = **$2.5M/year** + **$200k heating costs**

### **Our Solution: Faster? Cheaper? Better?**
**ALL THREE (different customers value different attributes):**
1. **FASTER for Navy:** 6-month lead time → 3 days (Emergency)
2. **CHEAPER for CFOs:** Free up $4M capital → invest in growth
3. **BETTER for Compliance:** Pre-certified library (2-year cert → instant)

**Competitive Advantage vs Siemens/SAP Native Solutions:**
- **We integrate INTO SAP MRP** (first mover - Kwadwo confirmed no one has done this)
- **We orchestrate the network** (don't own printers like Atlantic XL)
- **We focus on Insurance Stock** (highest ROI, clearest business case)

## 🔄 Strategic Pivots Executed (Based on 25 Interviews)

### **Pivot #1: From "Storage Cost" to "Working Capital"**
**OLD (Interviews 1-15):** "We save you warehouse rent ($50k/year)."  
**NEW (Interviews 16-25):** "We free up $4M in working capital ($1M/year value)."  
**Why:** Kwadwo (Interview 25) + Carol's guidance → CFOs own working capital decisions.

### **Pivot #2: From "Predictive Maintenance" to "MRP Integration"**
**OLD (Interviews 1-10):** "We use AI to predict when parts fail."  
**NEW (Interviews 11-25):** "We integrate into SAP MRP to execute print-vs-buy decisions."  
**Why:** Kwadwo: "Don't build predictive maintenance. React to it. Integrate into MRP."

### **Pivot #3: From "All Parts" to "Insurance Stock"**
**OLD:** "We can print any part faster/cheaper."  
**NEW:** "We digitize your zero-turn Insurance Stock (highest ROI)."  
**Why:** Mining (Interview 17) rejected high-volume parts. Insurance Stock = perfect beachhead.

### **Pivot #4: From "Service Bureau" to "Network Orchestrator"**
**OLD:** "We buy printers and print parts."  
**NEW:** "We connect your SAP → OEM IP → Local printer → Certifier."  
**Why:** Atlantic XL (competitor) is asset-heavy. Poly Unity (parallel) proves orchestration model.

### **Pivot #5: From "AI-Powered" to "CFO-Focused"**
**OLD:** Lead with AI technology.  
**NEW:** Lead with financial ROI (working capital), add AI subtly.  
**Why:** Kwadwo: "AI will muddy the waters. Solve supply chain fundamentals first."

## 📈 Business Model Validation

### **Revenue Model:**
1. **Setup Fee:** $50k-$200k (Enterprise integration)
2. **Annual Subscription:** 1-2% of digitized inventory value
   - Example: Manage $10M digital inventory = $100k-$200k/year
3. **Transaction Fee:** 5-10% of each print job value (optional)

### **Cost Structure:**
- **Fixed:** Platform development ($500k initial), SAP integration, certification partnerships
- **Variable:** Cloud hosting, support, certification updates

### **Unit Economics (Example):**
- **Customer:** Tier 1 operator with $50M inventory
- **Our Management:** Digitize $10M Insurance Stock (20% of total)
- **Annual Fee:** 1.5% × $10M = **$150k/year recurring revenue**
- **Customer Savings:** $10M × 25% holding cost = $2.5M/year
- **Customer ROI:** $2.5M saved - $150k paid = **$2.35M net benefit (15.7:1 ROI)**
- **Our Gross Margin:** 80% (software-based, low COGS)

### **TAM Validation:**
- **Canadian O&G spare parts market:** $2B inventory → $400M digitizable
- **At 1.5% fee:** $6M TAM (Canada only)
- **Global offshore O&G:** $50B inventory → $1B digitizable → **$150M TAM**
