# Week 6 Lab2Market Session - Customer Segments & Market Sizing
**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Instructor:** Randy  
**Topic:** Customer Segmentation and Market Sizing  
**Presentation:** L2M Oceans 2026 Customer Segments and Market Sizing FINAL 050226.pdf

---

## Session Overview

This session focused on two critical aspects of business model development:
1. **Customer Segmentation** - How to define and identify customer segments
2. **Market Sizing** - How to estimate the size and viability of your market opportunity

**Key Milestone:** By today (Week 6), teams should have completed **15 interviews** (cumulative).

---

## Core Principles Recap

### Prime Directive:
> Your job is to **validate the problem exists**, **understand who has it**, and **only then determine how best to solve it**. You are trying to **learn from customers**, not educate them.

### The "Why" Over "How":
- **Science asks "How?"**
- **Philosophy asks "Why?"**
- PhD = Doctor of **Philosophy**
- Focus on understanding **WHY the problem exists** before solving it

### 100 Humans, 100 Perspectives:
- Interviewing one person 100 times ≠ 100 interviews
- Interviewing 2 people 50 times ≠ 100 interviews
- **Objective:** Talk to **100 different humans** to get **100 different perspectives**
- Assemble these perspectives into a broader understanding of your market/ecosystem

**Exception:** If someone is genuinely interested and wants a follow-up, take them up on it—they may be your **early adopter**.

---

## Understanding Your Customers

### Problem Solution Fit vs. Product Market Fit:

| Concept | Definition | When It Happens |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Problem Solution Fit** | Your product solves a specific problem for particular customers | Early stage - talking to individuals, getting personal perspectives |
| **Product Market Fit** | Your product meets the needs of a group of customers | Later stage - after gathering 100 perspectives, seeing patterns emerge |

**Evolution:**
- Start with **individual perspectives** (blind men and elephant analogy)
- Gather **100 different perspectives**
- Identify **patterns and trends** that emerge statistically
- Achieve **product-market fit** when strong links exist between value proposition and customer segments

---

## Market Definition (Jeffrey Moore - Crossing the Chasm)

### Three Components of a Market:

1. **Set of actual or potential customers** for a given product or service
2. **Common set of characteristics, needs, or wants** (problems and needs)
3. **Reference each other when making buying decisions** (word of mouth, case studies)

---

## Blue Economy / Oceans Market Segments

Randy proposed **6 high-level segments** (not exhaustive):

| Segment | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Defense** | Navies, military applications |
| **Shipping / Marine Transportation** | International shipping, coastal trade, vessel operations |
| **Research** | Academic research, ocean science |
| **Energy** | Offshore oil & gas, wind, tidal, solar |
| **Recreation** | Recreational boating, beach activities, swimming |
| **Fisheries & Aquaculture** | Commercial fishing, fish farming |

**Key Insight:** Customers in each segment have **different jobs to be done**, **different problems to solve**, and **different needs to fulfill**.

### Selecting Your Segment:
- Choose your segment **early** (e.g., "I'm in Defense" or "I'm in Energy")
- Use this as a **starting point** for finding contacts and conducting interviews
- Segment choice impacts your **product-market fit**

---

## Segmentation Example: Chart Plotter Business

Randy used a Chart Plotter (computerized navigation chart) as an example:

### Option 1: Marine Transportation Segment

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Market Segment** | Shipping / Marine Transportation |
| **Sub-Segment** | International foreign-going vessels |
| **Organization** | Maersk (large shipping company) |
| **Department** | Vessel Support Services |
| **Job Title** | Deckhand, Captain, First Mate |

### Option 2: Recreation Segment

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Market Segment** | Recreation |
| **Sub-Segment** | Sailboats (vs. powerboats) |
| **Organization** | Sarnia Flying Yacht Club |
| **Department** | Race Committee |
| **Job Title** | Owner/Operator |

**Key Takeaway:** Same product (Chart Plotter), but **vastly different customer needs**, **budgets**, **scale**, and **problems** depending on segment choice.

---

## Customer Definition

> **Customer:** Recipient of a good or service, product, or idea in exchange for **money or some other valuable consideration**.

### "Other Valuable Consideration" Examples:
- **Data** (Google, Facebook business model)
- **Catch data from fishing industry** (in exchange for AI-driven fishery predictions)
- **Partnership access** (research collaboration)

**Key Insight:** Customers don't always pay with money directly.

---

## Customer Segments Defined

> **Customer Segment:** Groups or subsets of customers who share certain **characteristics, problems, or needs**.

### Why Segment?
- You can't address each customer individually (impractical)
- Segmentation makes the market **manageable**
- Helps you focus on **who to talk to** and **who to target**

### You're Already Segmenting:
- When you search for job titles on LinkedIn
- When you decide "I need to talk to operations managers vs. executives"
- When you realize hands-on people have different priorities than executives

---

## Personas - The Ideal Customer Caricature

### What is a Persona?
- **Caricature or stereotype** representing a synthesis of common customer characteristics
- Represents an entire customer segment in one "cartoon character"
- Helps you keep a specific type of customer in mind

### Questions to Define a Persona:
- Do they share a **similar responsibility**?
- Are they experiencing the **same problem** the same way?
- Are they solving it now? Do they **wish they could**?
- Where are they currently **looking for solutions**?
- How do they make **buying decisions**?
- What are their related **preferences and tastes**?

---

## Customer Characteristics to Look For

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Demographic** | Age, gender, income, education, occupation |
| **Geographic** | Location, region, climate |
| **Behavioral** | Usage patterns, loyalty, buying frequency |
| **Psychographic** | Values, motivations, lifestyle, attitudes |
| **Technographic** | Technology adoption, platforms used |

**Psychographic = Understanding "WHY" customers do what they do**

**Key:** Determine which characteristics are **most relevant** to your startup.

---

## Smart Atlantic Example - Multiple Personas

Randy shared an example from his work at Marine Institute (Memorial University):

### Smart Atlantic Observatory:
- Web-based maritime information service
- Data from ocean buoys, satellites, ship observations
- Models, forecasts, and hindcasts
- Data warehouse + web map services
- Part of Canadian/Global Ocean Observing System

### Four Personas Identified:

| Persona | Description | Needs |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Mr. Tucker** | Small boat fisherman (20-foot boat, lobster/cod fishing) | Weather, wave conditions, safety info |
| **Mrs. Tucker** | Sitting at home worrying about Mr. Tucker | Is he safe? When will he be home? |
| **Captain Bob** | Captain of large commercial ships (oil tankers, cargo) | Navigation safety, route planning, weather |
| **Susie Scientist** | Ocean researchers, academics | Data access, analysis tools |

### Business Model Challenge:
- Everyone liked the service (positive feedback)
- **No clear path to monetize** (like Google's early struggle)
- Currently **government-funded** (publicly funded initiative)
- Mr. Tucker, Mrs. Tucker, Captain Bob won't pay directly
- Susie Scientist prefers to collect her own data (doesn't trust others' data)

**Lesson:** Good technology ≠ viable business model without clear revenue path.

---

## Workflow Analysis for Customer Segments

### Example: Greek Seafoods (Aquaculture)

Randy created a **fictitious PCR testing startup** for detecting ISA (Infectious Salmon Anemia) in aquaculture.

#### Step 1: Identify Industry Player
- **Company:** Greek Seafoods (East Coast aquaculture)

#### Step 2: Understand Their Job (from website)
> "Sustainable farming is the foundation of our operations. Lowest possible environmental impact, best possible fish welfare is both ethical, responsible, and driving economic profitability."

#### Step 3: Find Stakeholder
- **Name:** Gilbert (fictitious)
- **Title:** Site Manager
- **Experience:** 11 years in position (from LinkedIn)

#### Step 4: Confirm Job with Interview
- First question: **"Is this actually your job?"**
- Confirm secondary research with primary interview data

#### Step 5: Understand Workflow

Greek Seafoods workflow:
1. **Production** (growing fish) ← **PCR testing fits here**
2. Processing (preparing fish)
3. Sales & Distribution

**Gilbert's interest across workflow:**
- **High interest:** Production (his responsibility)
- **Low interest:** Processing, Sales & Distribution

**Key Insight:** Focus interview questions on **production side** where your solution fits.

#### Step 6: Talk to Multiple People in Organization

| Role | Workflow Focus | Decision Power |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Site Manager** (Gilbert) | Production | Moderate |
| **Sustainability Director** (Nelson) | Production / Ethics | High (strategic) |
| **Sales Manager** | Sales & Distribution | Low (for production tech) |
| **Managing Director** | Overall operations | High (budget approval) |

**Why talk to multiple people?**
- Understand **chain of command**
- Identify **decision makers** for your part of the workflow
- Learn whose **priorities outweigh others**
- Discover who has **budget authority**

**Budget Reality:**
- Site Manager may have budget up to $X
- Larger purchases require Managing Director approval
- Understanding this hierarchy = understanding buying process

---

## Firmographic Segmentation

> **Firmographic:** Like demographic, but for businesses/organizations (size, location, performance, structure)

### Why Firmographic Segmentation Matters:

Not all companies in the same industry are the same:
- Some are **innovation-focused** (production innovation)
- Some are **operations-focused** (processing efficiency)
- Some are **laggards** (do minimum required)
- Some are **early adopters** (eager to try new tech)

### Example: Aquaculture Companies

| Company | Production Innovation | Processing Innovation | Overall Stance |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Greek Seafoods | High | Moderate | **Innovator** |
| Company B | Low | High | **Early Adopter** (wrong focus for PCR) |
| Company C | Low | Low | **Laggard** |

**Strategic Focus:** If your solution targets **production**, focus on companies that **innovate in production**.

---

## Technology Adoption Lifecycle (Crossing the Chasm)

### The Bell Curve:

```
Innovators → Early Adopters → [CHASM] → Early Majority → Late Majority → Laggards
  2.5%          13.5%                     34%              34%            16%
```

---

### 1. Innovators (2.5% of market)

**Characteristics:**
- Most like you (love learning about new technologies)
- Strong aptitude for technical information
- Academic/engineering background
- Like to alpha/beta test new products
- As excited about the technology as you are
- Willing to help you along your path

**Advantages:**
- Give lots of feedback
- Help show rest of market how technology works
- Willing to work with you for free

**Disadvantages:**
- **Only a handful** in any market segment
- **Probably can't pay** for solution yet
- Not 100% clear on value to their organization
- **Expect you to take their feedback seriously** (requires time/attention)

**Randy's Advice:**
> "These are the people most like you. You'll know them when you find them—they're as excited as you are."

---

### 2. Early Adopters (13.5% of market)

**Characteristics:**
- Similar to innovators but **less willing to take risk**
- Looking for **competitive advantage** or **revolutionary breakthrough**
- **Better strategic vision** (been in industry/company longer)
- Understand **big-picture business ecosystem**
- Not afraid to take risks
- May become **partners** in the future

**Advantages:**
- **More of them** than innovators
- **Have budget** for pilot projects
- Can provide funding: *"We'll do a pilot project, and I'll fund it"*
- Serve as **reference customers** for mainstream market
- Want fast, customized solutions

**Randy's Advice:**
> "Treat these folks like gold. Don't let them go. They're going to catapult your startup into the mainstream market."

---

### 3. Early Majority (34% of market)

**Characteristics:**
- Looking for **sustainable product improvements**
- Want **evolutionary, not revolutionary** change
- Need to see it working first ("kick the tires")
- Don't take much risk
- Focus on **proven applications**
- Look for **market-leading companies** (gives them comfort)

**Why They Matter:**
- Reference your work with innovators/early adopters
- *"If this innovative company is using it, maybe we should try it"*
- Represent the **mainstream market opportunity**

**Challenge:**
- Need **proof** from your early adopter work first
- Won't adopt until technology is **established**

---

### 4. Late Majority (34% of market)

**Characteristics:**
- Skeptical, risk-averse
- Adopt only when necessary (competitive pressure)
- Need extensive references and proof

**Randy's Advice:**
> "No need to worry about this at your stage. This is the bigger market opportunity you're shooting for eventually."

---

### 5. Laggards (16% of market)

**Characteristics:**
- Adopt late in cycle
- May never adopt
- Resistant to change

**Randy's Advice:**
> "Ignore them for now."

---

## The Chasm (Critical Concept)

### What is the Chasm?

> The gap between **Early Adopters** and **Early Majority** where many startups **fail and fall through the cracks**.

**Why Startups Fall into the Chasm:**

1. **Scaling Challenges**
   - Easy to prove one-off to early adopter
   - Hard to scale up for mainstream market
   - Sudden demand from all directions: *"I want to buy that!"*

2. **Transition from Startup to Company**
   - **Startup** = searching for sustainable business model
   - **Company** = executing a business plan
   - Different objectives, different skills required

3. **Founder Problem**
   - Academic entrepreneurs good at working with early adopters
   - Not prepared for mainstream market (marketing, production, operations)
   - Founders hang on too long, can't make transition
   - May need to hire expertise in areas you're not interested in

**Randy's Insight:**
> "Maybe it's a perfectly good product, but it was the wrong team to deliver it at scale to the market."

### Crossing the Chasm Strategy:

- Focus on **innovators and early adopters** (your "early evangelists")
- They are the **booster stage for your rocket**
- Their **references** are what's needed to reach mainstream market
- They launch you across the chasm

---

## Early Adopter Characteristics (What to Look For)

✅ **High pain** or potential for **large gains**  
✅ **Aware they have a problem** (not passive—it's real and urgent)  
✅ **Actively searching for a solution**  
✅ May have created **DIY solution** (because they've been suffering)  
✅ **Access to budget** or project funding  
✅ Willing to do **pilot projects**

**Randy's Advice:**
> "You'll find that wonderful interview at some point where you're really interested in what they're doing, they're interested in what you're doing, and all of a sudden you got a partnership going."

---

## Market Sizing: Why It Matters

### The "20 Marine Labs" Problem:

Even if:
- ✅ Your product is excellent
- ✅ You have 100% traction (sell to all 20 labs)
- ✅ Your unit economics are great (99% margin)
- ✅ Customer acquisition cost is $1

**But:** 20 labs × $50/month = **$1,000/month revenue**

**Conclusion:** Not a viable business, regardless of how good everything else is.

### Market sizing helps you understand:
1. **Cost structure** (Business Model Canvas block)
2. **Revenue streams** (Business Model Canvas block)
3. **Is this a viable business?**

---

## Three Levels of Market Size

### 1. TAM - Total Addressable Market

**Definition:** The entire opportunity theoretically available

**Analogy:** How many fish are in the ocean?

**Questions:**
- How many people **could** be a customer?
- How large would market be **if everyone bought**?
- How many units would that be?

**Assumptions:**
- ❌ No competitors
- ❌ No constraints
- ❌ Unlimited resources
- ❌ Product serves whole market

**Reality Check:**
> "It's unreasonable to think you're gonna catch every fish in the sea."

**Use:** Sets an **upper bound** for reference, but **useless for startup planning**

---

### 2. SAM - Serviceable Addressable Market (or Sales Addressable Market)

**Definition:** That part of the market you could **reasonably expect to service**

**Analogy:** Your fishing quota (with geographic/regulatory restrictions)

**Questions:**
- How many people **need or could use** your product?
- How many have **money to buy** it?
- How large would market be if they all bought?
- How many units would that be?

**What reduces TAM to SAM:**
- **Geography** (East Coast Canada only, not global)
- **Regulations** (carriage requirements for certain vessel sizes)
- **Part of workflow** (production only, not processing/sales)
- **Specific use case** (ISA detection only, not all aquaculture testing)

---

### 3. Target Market

**Definition:** Your realistic initial target before scaling up

**Analogy:** How many fish will you actually catch? (Not your entire quota)

**Questions:**
- **Who** (innovators/early adopters) am I going to sell to?
- **How many** customers is that?
- **How large** would that market be in dollars if they all bought?
- **How many units** would that be?

**What reduces SAM to Target Market:**
- **Focus on early adopters** (not entire SAM)
- **Startup constraints** (small team, limited resources)
- **Proof needed** (must demonstrate value before scaling)
- **Natural market restrictions** (geography, season, efficiency)

---

## Market Sizing Examples (Randy's Illustrations)

### Example 1: Nutraceuticals from Ocean Resources

| Market Level | Description | Size |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| **TAM** | Everyone globally | Thousands |
| **SAM** | Adults of certain age range | Hundreds |
| **Target** | Adults of certain age **who already buy nutraceuticals** | Tens |

### Example 2: Marine Radars for Ships

| Market Level | Description | Size |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| **TAM** | All vessels globally | Thousands |
| **SAM** | Vessels of certain size (carriage requirements) | Hundreds |
| **Target** | Vessels of certain size **with outdated radars** | Tens |

---

## Understanding Your Unit (Important Discussion)

### Question from Student (Debbie):
> "How do I think about a 'unit' when I'm developing custom solutions for each customer in the first year?"

### Randy's Answer:
- **Early stage:** You're working through **pilot projects**
- **Pilot defines unit:** Through pilot, you'll define what your app/product features are
- **Unit emerges:** Eventually you'll understand your **unit metrics** (what you're selling repeatedly)

### Joanna's Addition:
> "You need to figure out how viable your business model is based on **unit economics**."

### Business Model Questions (Early Stage):
- How long does this pilot project take? (e.g., 3 months)
- How much does it cost me to deliver? ($X)
- Are they willing to pay $X?
- How many pilots can I do per year?
- How do I **automate/streamline** to scale beyond "driving a taxi cab" model?

---

## Three Approaches to Market Sizing

### 1. Top-Down Approach (Macro-Based)

**Process:**
- Google your industry (e.g., "offshore oil & gas market size")
- Use third-party market statistics
- Use available information online

**Sources:**
- Market research reports
- Industry association data
- Government data

**Calculate:**
1. **TAM:** All possible customers
2. **SAM:** What part of TAM does your product hit?
3. **Target:** What percentage of SAM in first 5 years?
4. Identify market segments you'll address (innovators + early adopters)
5. Estimate percentage of those you'll gain

**Randy's Warning:**
> "A lot of you have done this already in your applications. It shows laziness and lack of awareness that your market is actually much smaller."

**Common Mistake:**
- *"Offshore oil & gas is worth $20 billion annually globally. That's my market!"*
- ❌ This brings your credibility into question
- ✅ Your market is a **much smaller element** of that

**Remember:** Always document **assumptions** you made along the way.

---

### 2. Bottom-Up Approach (Micro-Based)

**Process:**
- Understand what it takes to **sell ONE**
- Scale up: How many per week → month → year?

**Questions:**
- How do I reach **one customer**?
- What **geographics** am I targeting?
- What **channels** do they prefer? (LinkedIn, email, phone)
- What's my **acquisition rate**? (How many can I reasonably acquire per territory?)
- What's the **revenue per customer**? (Customer Lifetime Value - CLV)
- Is it **recurring revenue**?
- How much does it **cost me** to acquire them? (Customer Acquisition Cost - CAC)

**Randy's Note:**
> "For a lot of you, that might start at 1 and work up from there. That's fine."

**Example:**
- Pilot project takes 3 months
- You can do 4 pilot projects per year
- Each costs $X
- Build from there: How do I automate? How do I scale?

---

### 3. Competition-Based Approach

**Process:**
- Identify competitors
- Analyze their size and market share
- Estimate total market from their combined share

**Questions:**
- How big are they?
- What's their market structure?
- Can you **steal market share** from them?
- Will your offering **expand the market** (bring new people in)?

**Example:**
- Two main competitors have 50% of market combined
- (Competitor A + Competitor B) × 2 = Total Market

**Additional Analysis:**
- How does your offering compare to theirs?
- Which parts of customer segment can you go after?
- Which competitors are in your target market?
- Can you take market share or expand the market?
- How much can your unique business model grow the market?

---

## Market Sizing Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ **Unfounded Claims About Market Size**
- Immediately brings credibility into question
- Shows you don't understand your actual market

### ❌ **Unsupported Assumptions**
- *"If I only get 10% of this billion-dollar market..."*
- Randy's response: **"Why 10%? Why not 1%? Why not 50%?"**
- Need **logic and evidence** to support assumptions

### ❌ **Lazy Google Research**
- Finding a huge industry number and claiming it as your market
- Not breaking it down to your specific segment/target

### ✅ **What to Do Instead:**
- Start **realistic and small**
- Understand your **target market** first
- Document **what assumptions** you're making
- Provide **logic and evidence** for your estimates
- Focus on what you can **actually achieve** as a small startup

---

## Your Advantage: Customer Discovery

> "You have an advantage over your competitors because of what you're learning during customer discovery."

**Why This Matters:**
- Competitors aren't talking to 100 customers
- You're gaining **deep market insights** they don't have
- This continued process **serves you well** at the end of the day

---

## Homework Assignments

### Assignment 1: Define Your Ideal Customer Persona

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What does your **ideal customer persona** look like?
2. What **demographic, geographic, behavioral, psychographic** elements define them?
3. Are they **innovators** or **early adopters**?
4. What else is unique about them?

**Randy's Suggestion:**
- Use **ChatGPT/AI** to help generate persona
- Prompt example:
  - *"This is what we're going to do. Please describe our ideal customer."*
  - ChatGPT response: *"Here's your customer."*
  - Follow-up: *"Why are they my ideal customers?"*
  - Go as deep as you want

**Important:**
> "Don't accept this verbatim. Assess it. See if it makes sense based on your own experience."

**Discuss with:**
- Your Team Lead (TL)
- Your Mentor
- Share with instructors for comments

---

### Assignment 2: Estimate SAM and Target Market

**Tasks:**
1. Start to get a sense of your **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**
2. Break it down to **Target Market**
3. Collect **secondary data** to back up assumptions

**You've Already Done:**
- Total Addressable Market (TAM) in your applications

**Now Do:**
- Refine to realistic SAM
- Narrow to Target Market (innovators + early adopters)
- Find data sources to support your estimates

**Resources Provided:**
- Randy included resources in presentation for understanding and calculating market size
- Follow up with Joanna and Carol for help

## Key Quotes from Randy

> "Your job is to validate the problem exists, understand who has it, and only then determine how best to solve it."

> "Interviewing one person 100 times is not 100 interviews. Talk to 100 different humans to get 100 different perspectives."

> "You're trying to understand humans—complex beings—through the lens of data."

> "You cannot target whole markets. You have to find your 5%." *(This aligns with Jim Granger's advice)*

> "Treat your early adopters like gold. Don't let them go. They're going to catapult your startup into the mainstream market."

> "Even if your product is excellent, if your market is only 20 labs paying $50/month, it's still not a viable business."

> "It's unreasonable to think you're gonna catch every fish in the sea."

> "You have an advantage over your competitors because of what you're learning during customer discovery."

## Strategic Insights for AddManuChain (Mahmoud's Project)

### From Jim Granger Interview (Embedded in Transcript):

Jim's feedback on AddManuChain concept validates several points from Randy's lecture:

1. **IP Protection Barrier:**
   - Jim: *"A lot of companies don't want to share IP. It doesn't matter how strong the NDA is."*
   - **Implication:** Need to focus on **non-proprietary parts** or **OEM-authorized designs**

2. **"Find Your 5%" - Customer Segmentation:**
   - Jim: *"You cannot target whole markets. You have to find your 5%."*
   - **Aligns with Randy's teaching:** Start small, focus on specific segment

3. **Non-Structural Parts = Better Fit:**
   - Jim: *"Electronics, controllers, relays... it's probably much easier to do."*
   - **Implication:** Narrow customer segment to **electronics/non-structural parts**

4. **Temporary Parts Positioning:**
   - Jim validated Navy example: *"I get the idea. I do, I do. That's good."*
   - **Implication:** Target market = **temporary replacement parts** for emergency use

### Applying Randy's Framework to AddManuChain:

| Market Level | AddManuChain Estimate |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **TAM** | All ocean industries globally (defense, O&G, shipping, etc.) - unrealistic |
| **SAM** | Offshore operations + defense + marine transportation on East Coast Canada needing spare parts |
| **Target Market** | Innovators/early adopters in defense (DND, Thales) + offshore O&G (OMV, forward-thinking operators) who need **electronics/non-structural temporary parts** |

**Persona (Based on Interviews):**
- **Lee Vessey type:** Defense project managers, sovereign resilience focus, government funding
- **Mikhail Glad kikh type:** Forward-thinking O&G operations managers, AI-interested, 15% ROI threshold
- **NOT mining** (Jean-Michel Fortin ruled out)

---

## Additional Resources Mentioned

Randy mentioned these in the presentation:
- **Crossing the Chasm** by Geoffrey Moore (book)
- Market sizing calculation resources (in presentation slides)
- Joanna and Carol for research database access
- ChatGPT/AI for persona development

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Complete 15 interviews by end of Week 6**
2. ✅ **Define ideal customer persona** (Assignment 1)
3. ✅ **Estimate SAM and Target Market** (Assignment 2)
4. ✅ **Continue adding 15-20 contacts daily**
5. ✅ **Target: 15 interviews per week** to reach 100 by end of program

## Questions Addressed During Session

### Q: How to think about a "unit" when developing custom solutions early on?
**A (Randy):** You're early in understanding unit economics. Through pilot projects, you'll define what your app/product features are and eventually understand your unit metrics.

### Q: What reduces TAM to SAM besides competitors?
**A (Randy):** Geography, specific aspects of market segment (e.g., production side only), regulations, customer characteristics. Depends on your startup and market.

### Q: Is ideal customer linked to current status or 3-5 year future?
**A (Randy):** Start with realistic current target market (small numbers—innovators/early adopters). European market might be part of SAM in future, but focus on achievable target now.

### Q: How to identify target market companies?
**A (Randy):** Based on people working in those companies. Engage their interest. You'll know innovators when you talk to them—they're as excited as you are.

### Q: How to account for market size increases/decreases over time?
**A (Randy):** Understand external drivers and trends (from ecosystem analysis). Use AI/Google to research trends. Anything forward-looking has risk, but account for it.

## Conclusion

This session emphasized the critical importance of:
1. **Segmenting your market** realistically (not trying to serve everyone)
2. **Focusing on innovators and early adopters** as your target market
3. **Understanding market size** at three levels (TAM, SAM, Target)
4. **Avoiding unfounded claims** about market opportunity
5. **Learning from customer discovery** as your competitive advantage

**Randy's Core Message:**
> Start small, be realistic, focus on early adopters, and use customer discovery to understand your market better than anyone else.
