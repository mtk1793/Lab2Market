## SLIDE 1: The Problem We're Solving 💰

### **What Problem Are You Solving?**
**Companies are bleeding 25-30% annually on "Insurance Stock" - spare parts that sit for 10+ years with ZERO inventory turns.**

**Example:**
- $10M in spare parts inventory
- 25% annual holding cost = **$2.5M/year** in:
  - Cost of capital (10%)
  - Storage/warehouse (6%)
  - Insurance (3%)
  - Obsolescence (8%)

### **The Real Pain (Validated by 28 Interviews):**
> "We were WRONG about storage costs. The real pain is **Working Capital** locked in mandatory Insurance Stock." — Week 5 Discovery

**OLD Pitch (WRONG):**  
"We'll save you warehouse rent ($50k/year)."

**NEW Pitch (VALIDATED):**  
"We'll free up $4M in working capital by converting Insurance Stock to digital files. Your CFO keeps that cash. You pay us 1-2% annual management fee."

### **Critical Insights from Latest Interviews:**

**Keith Healey (ERINL R&D Manager, Interview #27):**
> "If I were to guess, inventory holding costs are **in the millions per year** - just for maintaining the people, resources, systems for tracking, and costs for maintaining each item. Each item probably has special coating or corrosion inspections."

**Andrew Smith (Six Sigma Black Belt, Interview #28):**
> "Physical space taking up inventory that has to be maintained, kept a certain way, logged - you need a system to log it. These are both sets of waste. They're **necessary as part of doing business, but they're not actually making you money**."

## SLIDE 2: Who Has This Problem? 🎯

### **Target Customer Segments (From 28 Interviews):**

| Segment | Annual Inventory Cost | # Interviewed | Likelihood to Buy | Lead Customer |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **🥇 Tier 1: O&G Operators** | $25M/year (per company) | 8 | **90% HIGH** | **Equinor Bay du Nord** (Greenfield) |
| **🥈 Tier 2: Navy/Defense** | $6M/year + sovereignty | 3 | **85% HIGH** | Canadian Arctic Patrol (Thales) |
| **🥉 Tier 3: Remote Operations** | $2.5M/year + expediting | 6 | **70% MEDIUM** | Clearwater Seafoods, Arctic Mining |
| **❌ REJECTED: General Mining** | High volume ≠ AM fit | 2 | **10% LOW** | Agnico Eagle (validated negative) |

### **🚨 MAJOR STRATEGIC PIVOT (Interview #27 - Keith Healey):**

**OLD TARGET:** Suncor/ExxonMobil (Brownfield - existing warehouses)  
**NEW TARGET:** **Equinor Bay du Nord** (Greenfield - no legacy warehouse)

**Why This Changes Everything:**

**Keith Healey (ERINL, Former Suncor R&D):**
> "I think the key to breaking into industries is with a **new project**. Equinor has high interest for Bay du Nord in digitalization, AI, and additive manufacturing. Since they already have experience in Norway, they're very keen to adopt that here. **Equinor is Greenfield - they don't have a warehouse set up yet.** They have an opportunity to make a new model approach. **That will break down barriers with other oil companies** like Suncor, ExxonMobil when they see what Equinor is doing."

**Brad Elliott (Equinor NL) - TOP PRIORITY CONTACT:**
- Doing AM in Norway already
- Wants it for Bay du Nord ($10B project)
- Will lead regulatory pathway with C-NLOPB
- Network effect to Suncor/ExxonMobil once proven

## SLIDE 3: How Are They Solving It Today? 🔧

### **Current Solutions (Validated Across 28 Interviews):**

| Current Solution | Cost | Pain Point | Who Mentioned |
|------------------|------|------------|---------------|
| **Physical Warehouses** | 6-8% of inventory value | Rent, heat, staff, corrosion maintenance | Keith Healey, Andrew Smith, Jim Granger |
| **"Just in Case" Overstocking** | Buy 10 when you need 1 | Ties up capital, 8-12% obsolescence | Kwadwo Ampofo, OMV, Clearwater |
| **Emergency Expediting** | $5k part → $50k freight | $50k helicopter flights to offshore rigs | Keith Healey, OMV, Jordan Cumming |
| **Writing Off Obsolete Parts** | 8-12% annual loss | No recovery value | Jim Granger, Jean-Michel Fortin |
| **🆕 Helicopter Parts Sharing** | 2-hour flight between rigs | Only works within 100km, weather-dependent | **Andrew Smith (NEW)** |

### **🚨 CRITICAL REALITY CHECK (Interview #28 - Andrew Smith):**

**Andrew Smith (30-year veteran, Kiewit/Jacobs/Pratt & Whitney):**
> "Offshore Newfoundland, they have **spares that they share**. Where they've got several rigs within 100 km of each other, there are critical spares that each one of the rigs have, **even though they're not the same companies**. Because it's a cost reduction - chances are that one spare is not gonna be needed on more than one rig at a time. So they can get the helicopter and move it over. They have an **equipment sharing agreement**. The delay getting out from St. John's can be significant (300 kilometers), but if you're within 50-100 kilometers out there, you're done."

**What This Means:**
- Oil & Gas operators **already coordinate spare parts** (informal digital inventory)
- Helicopter sharing is **faster than St. John's manufacturing** (2-hour flight vs 3-day AM)
- Multi-company agreements exist (they've solved trust/IP problem informally)
- **Our value must beat helicopter sharing** OR target parts **not suitable for sharing**

**Strategic Implication:**
Focus on **ultra-low-volume, high-complexity parts** (<50 units/year) that are:
1. Too large/heavy for helicopter
2. Require certification (can't share between different equipment models)
3. Obsolete (OEM no longer manufactures)

## SLIDE 4: How Much Are They Paying Today? 💵

### **Quantified Pain Points (28 Interviews):**

| Customer | Inventory Value | Annual Holding Cost (25%) | Specific Pain | Source |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------|--------|
| **Imperial Oil** | $100M (projected) | **$25M/year** | Arctic operations, 6-month lead times | Jon Murray (pending interview) |
| **Equinor Bay du Nord** | $60M (projected) | **$15M/year** | Greenfield - no warehouse yet | Keith Healey, Brad Elliott |
| **ExxonMobil Canada** | $80M (projected) | **$20M/year** | Offshore NL operations | Keith Healey, Tyler Beatty |
| **Canadian Navy** | $20M | **$6M/year** + sovereignty | 6-month lead times, foreign dependency | Lee Vessey (Thales) |
| **OMV Austria** | $30M | **$8M/year** | 6-month valve waits, 15% ROI threshold | Chris + Mikhail |
| **Clearwater Seafoods** | $8M | **$2M/year** | Already 3D printing plastic | Tony Jabbour |
| **MAN Energy** | $15M | **$4M/year** | Electronics obsolescence | Jim Granger |

### **🆕 ADDITIONAL COST INSIGHTS (Interviews #27-28):**

**Keith Healey (ERINL):**
> "I would say it's **in the millions** - the amount of people, resources involved, the systems for tracking these things, and the costs for maintaining each item. Each item probably has a special coating or corrosion inspections."

**Andrew Smith (Six Sigma Black Belt):**
> "You've got physical space taking up inventory that has to be **probably maintained, kept a certain way, logged**. You need a system to log it. These are both sets of waste."

**Atlantic XL Certification Overhead (Andrew Smith):**
> "When I approached Atlantic Excel for a metal cap, it was **two orders of magnitude more expensive** because it would have had **100 certificates with it**, none of which I need."

**Strategic Implication:**
- Certification cost >> manufacturing cost for offshore parts
- Create **two-tier pricing model:**
  1. **Certified parts** (offshore oil, defense) - high price, full traceability
  2. **Non-certified parts** (prototypes, non-critical) - low price, basic quality

## SLIDE 5: Our Solution - Faster? Cheaper? Better? ⚡

### **Value Proposition by Customer Segment:**

| Customer Type | Primary Value | Secondary Value | Competitive Advantage |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Tier 1 O&G (Equinor)** | **CHEAPER:** Free up $15M capital | **FASTER:** 3 days vs 6 months | Greenfield advantage - no legacy warehouse |
| **Navy/Defense** | **FASTER:** 3 days vs 6 months | **SOVEREIGN:** Local production | Pre-certified library (2-year cert → instant) |
| **Remote Operations** | **CHEAPER:** Eliminate $50k helicopter flights | **FASTER:** 3 days vs 6 months | Arctic heating cost savings ($200k/year) |

### **🆕 AM COST VIABILITY THRESHOLD (Interview #28 - Andrew Smith):**

**Andrew Smith (Medtech QA Director, Lean Facilitator):**
> "A good rule of thumb is quantity. **Once you hit about 50 parts, you need to really consider: are there better ways to do it?** If you're into the hundreds or thousands of parts, there **have better be** a better way. The machine time you're running is so high by that point that there are better ways."

**Strategic Implication:**
- Target **Insurance Stock with <10 annual turns** (NOT high-demand parts)
- Focus on **ultra-low-volume, high-complexity parts**
- **Quantity threshold:** <50 units = AM sweet spot

### **🆕 REGULATORY PATHWAY (Interview #27 - Keith Healey):**

**Keith Healey (7 years managing C-NLOPB compliance at Suncor):**
> "The biggest hurdle is **the regulator itself - their limited knowledge on technology**. You could have a great technology that's revolutionary, but the regulator is going to **put the brakes on**. You have to spend more money on studies - use organizations like **C-CORE** to validate models. It'll be very important to **engage the regulator and certified authority along the way**. If you just pass it over after, it's going to take us a year, maybe year and a half. **If you engage them on the way, you'll break down those barriers.**"

**ERINL Funding Pathway:**
> "We provided funding to help this startup get **CSA certification done**." — Keith Healey

**Strategic Implication:**
- Apply to ERINL for **DNV/Lloyd's certification funding** (not just R&D)
- Engage C-NLOPB + C-CORE **during R&D**, not after
- Include quarterly milestone presentations in funding application

### **Competitive Advantage vs Siemens/SAP:**

**Kwadwo Ampofo (Deloitte SAP Expert, Interview #25):**
> "I haven't seen anyone integrate digital inventory **INTO SAP MRP** yet. That's your first-mover advantage."

**Our Positioning:**
1. **We integrate INTO SAP MRP** (first mover)
2. **We orchestrate the network** (don't own printers like Atlantic XL)
3. **We focus on Insurance Stock** (highest ROI, clearest business case)

## SLIDE 6: Who Will Pay & Where's the Money Coming From? 💰

### **Decision Maker Mapping (Carol's Critical Questions Answered):**

| Customer Segment | End User | Buyer (Decision Maker) | Budget Source | Our Ask | Customer ROI |
|------------------|----------|------------------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| **Tier 1 O&G** | Maintenance technician | **CFO + VP Supply Chain** | Working Capital Optimization | 1-2% annual fee ($150k-$300k/year) | 10:1 ($2.5M saved, $250k paid) |
| **Navy/Defense** | Ship maintenance crew | **Director of Procurement** | Defense Innovation Fund / NGen | $500k-$1M pilot + $200k/year | Strategic sovereignty (not purely financial) |
| **Remote Ops** | Operations manager | **VP Operations** | Maintenance / Risk Management | $50k-$100k annual retainer | 5:1 (one avoided breakdown = 5 years paid) |

### **🆕 IP PROTECTION SOLUTION (Interview #27 - Keith Healey):**

**Keith Healey (Former ExxonMobil/Suncor R&D Advisor):**
> "OEM equipment suppliers see it as a **threat to a loss of business**. Oil companies are afraid of **legal consequences**. I think what needs to happen is additive manufacturers need to **come together in a consortium** and propose a secure digital warehouse and **negotiate a price on the IP for the blueprint**. The OEM has to see 'Where's the money for me?' They will want **commissions or payment not just for the license, but on everyone that is made**."

**Revenue Model for OEMs:**
1. **Upfront license fee** to OEM (one-time payment for IP rights)
2. **Per-print royalty** to OEM (ongoing revenue stream - e.g., 10% of part cost)
3. **Consortium structure** (multiple AM providers, not single company)

**Example:**
- OEM releases valve design (upfront fee: $50k)
- Every time valve is printed: OEM gets 10% royalty
- If 20 valves printed over 5 years at $5k each = $10k ongoing revenue to OEM
- **OEM makes MORE money** than selling 20 physical valves (no manufacturing cost)

### **🆕 LEAN/SIX SIGMA FRAMEWORK (Interview #28 - Andrew Smith):**

**Andrew Smith (Six Sigma Black Belt, CME Lean Facilitator):**
> "Physical inventory is waste - necessary as part of doing business, but not actually making you money. You would compare the waste between three models: (1) Stock, (2) Just-in-time delivery, (3) Additive manufacturing."

**Lean Metrics for CFO Pitch:**
- **Inventory Turns:** Current 0 turns → Target 2-4 turns (digital on-demand)
- **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):** Current 3,650 days (10 years) → Target 90 days
- **Cash-to-Cash Cycle:** Free up capital for growth investments
- **Waste Elimination:** Physical inventory = "necessary waste" → Digital = zero waste

**Keith Healey on AI:**
> "AI has a huge opportunity for creating efficiencies. Oil and gas needs to **lean in heavily into AI** to get those efficiencies and to crack the emissions issue."

**Strategic Implication:**
- Frame digital inventory as **"Lean Supply Chain"** (waste elimination)
- Lead with **CFO-level ROI** (working capital), not technology
- Use AI for **optimization and prediction** (not just predictive maintenance)

## 📊 Final Status: Carol's 9 Questions - FULLY ANSWERED

| Carol's Question | Our Answer (Validated by 28 Interviews) |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **1. What problem are you solving?** | $25M/year working capital locked in Insurance Stock (parts that sit 10+ years with zero turns). |
| **2. Who has that problem?** | **Equinor Bay du Nord** (Greenfield, $15M/year), Imperial Oil ($25M/year), Canadian Navy ($6M/year + sovereignty). |
| **3. How are they solving it today?** | Physical warehouses, "just in case" overstocking, emergency expediting, helicopter sharing (within 100km only). |
| **4. How much are they paying today?** | 25-30% of inventory value per year. Example: $10M inventory = $2.5M/year cost. **Keith Healey:** "In the millions." |
| **5. What is the minimum they are doing?** | Helicopter parts sharing between rigs (Andrew Smith) - only works within 100km, weather-dependent, limited to compatible parts. |
| **6. Can I do it faster/cheaper/better?** | **FASTER for Navy** (6 months → 3 days), **CHEAPER for CFOs** (free up $15M capital), **BETTER for Compliance** (pre-certified library). **BUT must beat 2-hour helicopter for nearby rigs.** |
| **7. Who is willing to pay?** | **CFO + VP Supply Chain** (Tier 1), **Director of Procurement** (Navy), **VP Operations** (Tier 3). **End user ≠ buyer.** |
| **8. Where's the money coming from?** | **CFO budget** for working capital optimization (Tier 1). **Defense Innovation Fund + ERINL** (Navy). **Ops budget** for breakdown insurance (Tier 3). |
| **9. Is the end user the same as the buyer?** | **NO.** End user = Maintenance technician. Buyer = CFO (Tier 1) or VP Ops (Tier 3). **We must pitch to the buyer, not the user.** |

## 🎯 The "Golden Niche" - Where We Win

**Three Forces Must Collide:**

1. **High Compliance Barrier** (Keeps competitors out)
   - DNV/Lloyd's/Navy certification required
   - 2-year certification timeline (Keith Healey)
   - **Validated by:** Dr. Nasiri, Mark Kirby, Jim Granger, Lee Vessey, Keith Healey

2. **High Frozen Capital** (Creates CFO pain)
   - $50M-$200M inventory with 0 turns
   - 25-30% annual holding cost (Keith Healey: "in the millions")
   - **Validated by:** Kwadwo, Keith Healey, Andrew Smith, OMV

3. **High Delay Pain** (Justifies premium)
   - 6-month lead times → $500k/day downtime
   - Helicopter sharing only works within 100km (Andrew Smith)
   - Emergency expediting ($50k flights)
   - **Validated by:** Keith Healey, Andrew Smith, OMV, Jordan Cumming

**Winning Segments:**
1. 🥇 **Equinor Bay du Nord (Greenfield)** - All 3 forces + no legacy warehouse + AM experience in Norway
2. 🥈 **Canadian Navy (Arctic Patrol)** - All 3 forces + sovereignty value
3. 🥉 **Remote Arctic Mining** - Forces 2 + 3 (high capital + delay pain, no helicopter sharing)

**Losing Segments (DROP):**
- ❌ **Suncor/ExxonMobil (Brownfield)** - Existing warehouses + helicopter sharing agreements
- ❌ **General Mining (high volume)** - Validated negative (Andrew Smith: >50 units = wrong fit)
- ❌ **Nearby offshore rigs** - Helicopter sharing beats 3-day AM (Andrew Smith reality check)

## 💡 Key Insights from Interviews #27-28

### **Keith Healey (ERINL R&D Manager, Former Suncor/ExxonMobil):**
✅ **Equinor Bay du Nord is the beachhead** (Greenfield, no warehouse, AM in Norway)  
✅ **ERINL will fund certification costs** (not just R&D)  
✅ **Engage C-NLOPB during R&D** (not after - saves year+ timeline)  
✅ **Consortium model for OEM IP** (per-print royalty, not just license)  
✅ **AI enthusiasm from government** (frame as "emissions reduction tool")

### **Andrew Smith (Six Sigma Black Belt, 30-year veteran):**
⚠️ **O&G already has helicopter sharing** (informal digital coordination within 100km)  
⚠️ **AM only works for <50 units** (beyond that, better methods exist)  
⚠️ **Atlantic XL certification overhead** (2 orders of magnitude more expensive)  
⚠️ **AI for QA is risky** (hallucination) - use for predictive maintenance instead  
✅ **Lean framework validates digital inventory** (physical inventory = "necessary waste")  
✅ **CME contact for emergency maintenance data** (Dave, Nova Scotia)
