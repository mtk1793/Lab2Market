## General Principles for ALL Outreach

✅ **DO:**
- Personalize every message (mention their specific work/company)
- Keep it under 100 words
- Emphasize you're LEARNING, not selling
- Offer 15-20 minute time frame (respects their time)
- Give them an easy out ("If timing isn't right, no worries")

❌ **DON'T:**
- Copy-paste generic templates
- Mention your "solution" or "platform"
- Use salesy language
- Ask for more than 20 minutes
- Send on Mondays (inbox overload) or Fridays (weekend mode)

## Email Tracking Metrics

**Track these in your CRM:**

| Metric | Target | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Open Rate** | 40-60% | Subject line is working |
| **Response Rate** | 15-25% | Message is compelling |
| **Meeting Conversion** | 10-15% | They see value in talking |
| **No-Show Rate** | <20% | Good scheduling/reminders |

**If your response rate is <10%:**
- Subject line might be too salesy
- Message is too long (keep under 100 words)
- Not enough personalization
- Asking too much (lower to 15 minutes)

---

### Referrals (GOLD STANDARD)
- **Pros**: 50%+ response rate, pre-qualified, warm intro
- **Cons**: Requires network, limited supply

## Red Flags in Responses

❌ **"Send me more information about your solution"**
→ Response: "I'm still in learning mode and don't have a solution yet. Just trying to understand your challenges."

❌ **"I'm too busy right now"**
→ Response: *Don't push. Thank them and move on.*

❌ **"Can we do this over email instead?"**
→ Response: "I'd love to hear your thoughts in real-time if possible, but I understand if a call doesn't work. Would a quick 10-minute Zoom be easier?"

✅ **"I'd love to help! When works for you?"**
→ *Send calendar link or offer 3 specific time slots.*

---

**Remember:** The goal is 100 interviews. You'll send 500-700 outreach messages. Expect 85-90% to ignore you. That's normal! Keep going.
