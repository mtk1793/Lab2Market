## 2. 🎯 THE PROBLEM
> *Speak to the pain the platform solves. Resonate with the target customer.*

**Section Title:** The Spare Parts Problem No One Has Fully Solved

**Pain Points:**
| Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|
| Long lead times for critical spare parts (weeks to months) | Costly vessel/plant downtime |
| High logistics & warehousing costs for slow-moving inventory | Capital tied up in stock |
| Geographic isolation of offshore/remote assets | No local supplier available |
| Counterfeit and uncertified replacement parts | Safety and compliance risks |
| Fragmented communication between OEMs and operators | Delays and errors in ordering |

**Summary Statement:**
> Operators lose thousands of dollars every hour their asset is down waiting for a part. The traditional supply chain was designed for a world without additive manufacturing.

## 3. 💡 THE SOLUTION
> *What AddManuChain does and how it works.*

**Section Title:** A Smarter Supply Chain, Powered by Additive Manufacturing

**How It Works — 3 Simple Steps:**

### Step 1: 📋 Order a Part
An operator identifies a needed part and submits a request through the platform, selecting from a library of OEM-certified digital blueprints.

### Step 2: 🏭 Certified Local Printing
The platform automatically routes the order to the nearest certified print center with the right equipment, material, and capacity — minimizing distance and lead time.

### Step 3: 🚚 Deliver & Certify
The printed part is quality-verified against the OEM blueprint, certified, and shipped with a full digital audit trail — ensuring traceability and compliance.
