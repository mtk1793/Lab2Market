# AddManuChain — Public Website Design Brief

> **Purpose:** Design the public-facing marketing & platform website for AddManuChain.  
> **Audience:** Offshore operators, naval procurement, OEM supply chain managers, AM facility operators.  
> **Tone:** Professional, industrial, trustworthy — NOT startup-y or AI-hype. Grounded.  
> **Based on:** 50+ customer discovery interviews + ALMA-TECH pitch deck (2021–2026)

---

## 🎯 Core Message (The One Thing)

> **"When a part fails at sea, every hour costs $50,000–$100,000. We print certified replacements in days, not weeks."**

Everything on the site flows from this. Lead time compression for remote operations is the validated #1 pain point across all segments.

## 📄 Page 1 — Home (`/`)

### Section A: Hero

**Headline:** `The On-Demand Part. When You're 500km from the Nearest Warehouse.`

**Subheadline:**  
AddManuChain connects OEM blueprint owners, certified 3D-printing centers, and offshore operators — delivering LR/DNV-certified parts on demand.

**Primary CTA:** → `Request a Pilot`  
**Secondary CTA:** → `See How It Works`

**Hero Visual Direction:**  
Full-bleed dark image — offshore platform OR Arctic vessel in fog. Minimal, serious, industrial.

### Section B: The Pain (Numbers First)

> Design note: 3 stat cards, white on dark slate background. No fluff. Numbers from real interviews.

| Stat | Source |
|------|--------|
| **$50K–$100K/day** downtime when a part fails at sea | Adam Mars, Rosen Maritime (Interview #48) |
| **$30–50M** inventory sitting unused per offshore vessel | Jason Power, Noble Corp (Interview #4) |
| **9–14 weeks** average lead time for a replacement part in remote operations | Multiple interviewees |

**Section Header:** `The problem is not technology. It's time.`

**Body copy:**  
*"Remote and offshore operators already know additive manufacturing exists. What they don't have is a pre-certified, on-demand supply chain they can trust. When a thruster bearing fails in the Arctic, you can't wait for a courier from Rotterdam."*  
— Validated by Lonita Judge, COO, Horizon Maritime

---

### Section C: How It Works (3 Steps)

**Section Header:** `Print. Certify. Deliver. That's the whole system.`

```
Step 1 — Blueprint Library
OEM partners deposit certified CAD blueprints into the platform. 
Every file is IP-protected, version-controlled, and traceable.

Step 2 — Certified Print Center Network
Buyers request a part. The platform routes it to the nearest 
LR or DNV-certified 3D-printing facility.

Step 3 — Audit-Traced Delivery
Every print creates an immutable receipt: who printed it, 
on which machine, with which material, certified to which standard.
```

**Callout quote:**  
> *"You're the Amazon for additive manufacturing. You take 10%. The 90% goes back to the original designer."*  
> — Dwayne Hopkins, Mentor, Co-Innovation Centre, St. John's NL

### Section D: Who It's For (3 Segments)

**Section Header:** `Built for industries where 'out of stock' is not an option.`

| Segment | Pain | Our Answer |
|---------|------|-----------|
| ⛽ **Offshore Oil & Gas** | Long lead times for critical spare parts | Pre-certified digital inventory printed at nearest facility |
| ⚓ **Naval & Defense** | Sovereign capability for ships far from logistics hubs | Canada-based AM network with immutable print trail |
| 🧊 **Arctic & Remote Utilities** | Getting a repair person out takes longer than the repair | Nearest certified facility prints and ships |

---

### Section E: Trust Bar

**Section Header:** `Every part is certified before it leaves the printer.`

Logos/badges: Lloyd's Register — DNV GL — Atlantic XL — Lab2Market Oceans 2026

**Supporting copy:**  
*"Certification is the #1 adoption barrier in this industry. We built the certification workflow into the platform — not as an afterthought."*

### Section F: Footer CTA

**Headline:** `Your next unplanned outage doesn't have to cost $75,000 a day.`

**CTA:** → `Join the Pilot Program`

## 📄 Page 2 — How It Works (`/how-it-works`)

### The 3-Node Model

#### Node 1: Designers (OEM Blueprint Owners)
- Deposit pre-certified CAD files into the encrypted library
- Every file has version control, access permissions, and IP logging
- OEMs earn 90% royalty on every print — passively, with full traceability

#### Node 2: Print Centers (Certified AM Facilities)
- Vetted, LR/DNV-certified facilities across Canada
- Pre-qualified: material, process, machine, and operator all certified
- First anchor partner: **Atlantic XL, Halifax NS**

#### Node 3: Buyers (Operators)
- Offshore operators, naval procurement, Arctic fleet managers
- Request a part → nearest certified center prints → audit trail delivered with every order

#### Platform Role: Trust Layer
- IP protection via encrypted access control + immutable audit logs
- Pre-certification stored per-part (certify once, use across all prints)
- AI feasibility layer: which parts in your inventory are AM-viable?

### Just-In-Case vs. Just-In-Time

| | Legacy (Just-in-Case) | AddManuChain (Just-In-Time) |
|---|---|---|
| Storage | $30–50M physical warehouse per vessel | Digital library — unlimited parts, zero storage cost |
| Lead time | 9–14 weeks from OEM | 3–5 days from nearest certified center |
| Certification | Re-certify every run | Certify once, reuse across all prints |
| IP Risk | Reverse-engineerable from physical parts | Encrypted, logged, permissioned |
| Obsolescence | Parts EOL = useless inventory | Print on demand = no obsolescence |

## 📄 Page 3 — Who It's For (`/who-its-for`)

### Offshore Oil & Gas (Beachhead)
- **Target:** Equinor Bay du Nord (greenfield — no legacy warehouse)
- **Pain:** $500K–$1M/day drilling downtime; $30–50M unused inventory per vessel
- **Entry:** Non-critical, non-structural parts first (bearings, brackets, fittings, sensor mounts)
- **Quote:** *"If there's a long lead time, that's when we run into the problems."* — Lonita Judge, Horizon Maritime
- **CTA:** → Request an inventory feasibility assessment

### Canadian Navy / Defense
- **Validated:** Thales + Cove partnership; Arctic Patrol Vessel AM digital library program
- **DND Language:** *"Advanced sovereign and scalable production methods to optimize system performance through supply chain resilience, production volume, and rapid redesign."*
- **Entry:** Temporary non-certified parts for emergency on-ship use (validated: Lee Vessey, Thales)
- **CTA:** → Request a defense consultation

### Arctic & Remote Utilities
- **Validated:** Adam Chubbs (Ecotex/Frobisher Energy) — $4–5M inventory for $50M asset base
- **Entry:** Self-certifiable non-structural components
- **CTA:** → Talk to our team

## 📄 Page 4 — Trust & Certification (`/trust`)

**Header:** `"Trust nobody, test everything." — Bachar Elzein, Reaction Dynamics`

### 3 Pillars of Trust

#### 1. Pre-Certified Parts Library
- Certified once (LR/DNV Type Approval or DNV GL Part 6)
- Certification stored per material–printer–process combination
- Operators never re-certify the same part — cert carries across all prints

#### 2. IP Security & Audit Trail
- Blueprints in encrypted, access-controlled repository
- Every print: immutable log with user, org, machine, material, timestamp
- On-premise option for OEMs requiring full data sovereignty

#### 3. Quality Assurance by Design
- Test coupons printed alongside every production run
- In-process monitoring (ASTM-aligned)
- Full material traceability from powder batch → finished part

- Full LR/DNV audit trail delivered with your first part

### Pricing:
- One-time digital inventory license fee per part
- Per-print transaction fee (OEM receives 90%, platform takes 10%)
- No subscription. No commitment beyond the pilot.

### Contact Form Fields:
- Name / Role / Organization
- Sector: [ ] O&G  [ ] Naval  [ ] Arctic/Utility  [ ] Other
