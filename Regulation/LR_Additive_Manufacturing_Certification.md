## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: When is a part suitable for additive manufacturing?
A part is suitable for additive manufacturing when it provides clear benefits over traditional methods, such as:
- Enabling complex designs
- Customisation or combining multiple components into one
- Potential for topology optimisation
- Shorter lead times
- Lower shipping and tooling costs
- Improved material efficiency

The decision should also consider:
- Material properties
- Part size
- Production volume
- Effects on downstream processes (coating, joining, inspection, maintenance)

Manufacturers must also ensure the AM process meets all regulatory, application, and service-life requirements.

### Q2: What is the difference between Classification and Certification for AM parts?

| | **Classification** | **Certification** |
|--|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Applies to** | AM parts essential to a classed vessel or marine equipment | Parts in marine or offshore applications that do NOT require classification |
| **Requirements** | Full compliance with LR Rules and Regulations | Must meet industry standards, project specifications, or OEM requirements |
| **Includes** | Design appraisal, LR-certified feedstock, facility qualification, LR surveys during manufacturing and testing | Design appraisal, facility and feedstock verification, inspection or testing |
| **LR Rules** | Full compliance required | Does NOT require full compliance with LR Rules for classed assets |

---

### Q3: Why should I get LR certification for AM parts?
LR certification independently verifies that AM parts, processes, and materials meet recognised standards. Benefits:
- Reduces technical and commercial risk
- Demonstrates compliance with regulatory or project requirements
- Builds confidence in quality and performance
- Supports client and stakeholder acceptance
- Helps manufacturers stand out in the market
- Streamlines procurement with LR-approved feedstocks and facilities
- Minimises costly rework or delays by validating designs and processes early
