# AirTable CRM Setup Guide
## How to Share with Your Facilitator

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create Your AirTable Account
1. Go to **airtable.com**
2. Click **"Sign up for free"**
3. Use your university email (easier for your facilitator to verify)

---

### Step 2: Create Your Base
1. After logging in, click **"Start from scratch"** or **"Create a base"**
2. Name it: **"L2M Customer Discovery - [Your Project Name]"**
   - Example: "L2M Customer Discovery - Ocean Monitoring Tech"

---

### Step 3: Set Up Your Table Structure

Use the columns from the **CRM_Interview_Targets.md** document I created for you. Here's the quick setup:

#### Required Columns (in order):

| **Column Name** | **Field Type** |
|----------------|---------------|
| Contact Name | Single line text |
| Title | Single line text |
| Company | Single line text |
| Segment | Single select (options: "Offshore Energy", "Maritime Fleet", "Aquaculture") |
| Role Bias | Single select (options: "Buyer", "User", "Influencer", "Blocker") |
| LinkedIn URL | URL |
| Email | Email |
| Phone | Phone number |
| Outreach Date | Date |
| Outreach Method | Single select (options: "LinkedIn", "Email", "Phone", "Referral") |
| Interview Status | Single select (options: "Not Contacted", "Reached Out", "Scheduled", "Completed", "Declined") |
| Interview Date | Date |
| Pain Intensity (1-10) | Number (0-10 scale) |
| Problem (Verbatim) | Long text |
| Current Solution | Long text |
| Current Solution Cost | Currency (USD) |
| Key Insight | Long text |
| Willingness to Pay | Currency (USD) |
| Follow-up Date | Date |
| Referrals | Long text |
| Tags | Multiple select (options: "Early Adopter", "Skeptic", "Champion", "Decision Maker") |

---

### Step 4: Create Useful Views

AirTable "Views" are filtered/sorted versions of your data. Set these up:

1. **View: "This Week's Outreach"**
   - Filter: `Outreach Date` is `this week`
   - Sort: Outreach Date (ascending)

2. **View: "Interviews Scheduled"**
   - Filter: `Interview Status` is `Scheduled`
   - Sort: Interview Date (ascending)

3. **View: "Completed Interviews"**
   - Filter: `Interview Status` is `Completed`
   - Sort: Interview Date (descending)

4. **View: "Follow-ups Needed"**
   - Filter: `Follow-up Date` is `on or before` `today`
   - Sort: Follow-up Date (ascending)

5. **View: "Kanban Board"** (optional but useful)
   - Group by: `Interview Status`
   - Shows cards moving from "Not Contacted" → "Reached Out" → "Scheduled" → "Completed"

---

### Step 5: Add Sample Data

Before sharing with your facilitator, add **3-5 sample contacts** so they can see how you're using it.

Example:
| Contact Name | Title | Company | Segment | Interview Status |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| John Smith | VP Operations | Shell | Offshore Energy | Reached Out |
| Jane Doe | Fleet Manager | Maersk | Maritime Fleet | Not Contacted |

---

### Step 6: Share with Your Facilitator

#### Option A: Share via Email (Recommended)
1. Click the **"Share"** button (top-right corner of your base)
2. Click **"Invite by email"**
3. Enter your facilitator's email address
4. Set permission level:
   - **Editor**: They can view and edit (use this if they want to add notes)
   - **Commenter**: They can view and comment (read-only with feedback)
   - **Read-only**: They can only view (good for privacy)
5. Click **"Send invite"**

**Ask your facilitator which permission level they prefer!**

#### Option B: Share via Link
1. Click the **"Share"** button
2. Click **"Create a shareable link"**
3. Set link permission (Editor, Commenter, or Read-only)
4. Copy the link
5. Send it to your facilitator via email or Slack

---

### Step 7: Notify Your Facilitator

Send them an email like this:

```
Subject: AirTable CRM Access - L2M Customer Discovery

Hi [Facilitator Name],

I've set up my AirTable CRM for tracking customer discovery interviews. I've shared it with you at the [Editor/Commenter/Read-only] level.

Here's the link: [paste link if using Option B]

The base is called "L2M Customer Discovery - [Your Project Name]"

Currently, I have [X] contacts loaded and I'm targeting [Y] interviews this week.

Let me know if you have any issues accessing it or if you'd prefer a different permission level.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

---

### Step 8: Keep It Updated

**Daily habit**:
- Add new contacts as you find them
- Update "Interview Status" as you progress
- Log "Key Insights" immediately after each interview (while fresh!)

**Weekly review**:
- Check "Follow-ups Needed" view
- Count completed interviews for your weekly check-in
- Update any stale data

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My facilitator can't access the base"
- Check if they're using the correct email
- Verify the invite didn't go to spam
- Try sharing via link instead of email invite

### "I want to change the permission level"
1. Click "Share"
2. Find their email in the list
3. Click the permission dropdown
4. Change to desired level

### "Can I use Google Sheets instead?"
- Technically yes, but AirTable is **strongly recommended** because:
  - Better views and filters
  - Kanban boards for visual tracking
  - Easier collaboration
  - Industry standard for L2M

## Next Steps After Setup

3. Start outreach using templates
