**Subject:** Customer Segmentation Strategy Question - Multi-Sided Platform Model

---

Hi [Facilitator Name],

I wanted to update you on my business model development and get your guidance on customer discovery strategy.

## Business Model Update

I've refined my Lab2Market project from the initial ocean technology concept to a **3D printing ecosystem platform**. The core problem I'm addressing is:

**Manufacturers waste weeks finding certified local 3D printing facilities, pay high shipping costs, and struggle with regulatory compliance verification.**

## The Challenge: Multi-Sided Platform (5 Stakeholder Types)

My platform needs to connect **5 different customer segments** simultaneously:

1. **Clients (Manufacturers/Buyers)** - PRIMARY: They pay for the platform
2. **3D Printing Facilities** - SUPPLY SIDE: Fill idle capacity, pay commission
3. **Labs (Testing & Certification)** - Enable certification workflow
4. **OEMs (Equipment Manufacturers)** - Want distributed manufacturing
5. **Authorities (Regulatory Bodies)** - Need compliance tracking

## My Question

**Should I interview all 5 segments in parallel, or sequence them starting with Clients first?**

### Option 1: Interview All Segments Simultaneously (Weeks 1-8)
- **Pros**: Comprehensive understanding of entire ecosystem
- **Cons**: Diluted focus, may not validate core value prop before expanding

### Option 2: Sequential Approach (My Current Plan)
- **Week 1-2**: 20 interviews with Clients (validate the demand side)
- **Week 3-4**: 20 interviews with 3D Printing Facilities (validate supply side)
- **Week 5+**: Add Labs, OEMs, Authorities after validating core marketplace need

**My reasoning**: Start with the two-sided core (Clients + Facilities) to validate if there's a real marketplace opportunity, THEN add the certification/regulatory layers. This reduces the chicken-and-egg risk.

## Specific Questions for You:

1. Is it acceptable in Lab2Market to **sequence** customer discovery like this, or should I interview all segments from day one?

2. If I validate strong pain with Clients (weeks 1-2), can I use that as evidence to recruit Facilities more effectively in weeks 3-4?

3. How do I avoid the trap of "premature solution validation" when I talk to Labs/Authorities about a platform that doesn't exist yet?

4. Should my business thesis focus on ONE segment (Clients) or acknowledge all 5 from the start?

I've attached my updated Business Model Canvas and interview question guides if you'd like to review.

Looking forward to your guidance!

Best,
[Your Name]
