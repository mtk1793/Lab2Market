## 1. Target Customer Segments (Prioritized)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Multi-Sided Platform**: You must interview ALL 5 stakeholder types. Prioritize Clients (money side) and Facilities (supply side) first.

### Segment 1: Clients (Manufacturers/Buyers) ⭐ PRIMARY
**Why this segment**: They pay for the platform, have the urgent pain (finding certified facilities)

| **Target Titles** | **Companies to Research** | **LinkedIn Search Terms** |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|

| Operations Director | Medtronic, Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson (medical devices) | "operations" + "medical device manufacturing" |
| Supply Chain Manager | Ford, GM, Tesla (automotive) | "supply chain" + "3D printing" OR "additive" |
| Manufacturing Engineer | Protolabs customers, local manufacturers | "manufacturing engineer" + "prototyping" |

**Expected Pain Points to Validate**:
- Finding certified local 3D printing facilities takes weeks
- High shipping costs from distant suppliers
- Uncertainty about regulatory compliance/certifications

---

### Segment 2: 3D Printing Facilities ⭐ CO-PRIMARY (SUPPLY SIDE)
**Why this segment**: Need to fill idle capacity, willing to pay commission for leads

**Expected Pain Points to Validate**:
- 30-40% idle machine capacity
- Customer acquisition costs $5-10K per client
- Hard to prove certifications to new buyers

---

### Segment 3: Labs (Testing &amp; Certification) ⭐ SECONDARY
