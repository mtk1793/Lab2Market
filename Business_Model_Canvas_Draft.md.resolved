---

### ⑤ Revenue Streams

**How do we make money? What's the revenue model? Pricing tactics?**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hybrid Platform Model**: We monetize from MULTIPLE stakeholder types to reduce chicken-and-egg risk and align incentives.

| **Revenue Stream** | **Who Pays** | **Model** | **Price Point** | **Justification** |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Marketplace Commission** | 3D Printing Facilities | Per-transaction | 10-15% of job value | Only pay when they get business through platform |
| **Client Premium Subscription** | Clients (Manufacturers) | Annual | $5K-$25K/year | Access to priority matching, expedited certification, analytics|
| **Certification Licensing Fee** | Labs | Annual | $10K-$50K/year | To be listed as "verified partner" on platform |
| **OEM Enterprise License** | OEMs | Annual | $50K-$150K/year | Distributed manufacturing management dashboard |
| **Freemium Basic Access** | Clients | Free | $0 | Basic search and contact (convert to premium later) |

**Total Annual Revenue Potential (at scale)**:
- **Year 1**: 100 facilities × 10 jobs/month × $1,000 avg × 12% commission = **$1.44M**
- **Year 2**: + 50 premium clients × $15K = **$750K**
- **Year 3**: + 20 labs × $25K + 10 OEMs × $100K = **$1.5M**
- **Year 3 Total**: **~$3.7M ARR**

**Why This Model Works**:
- **Facilities pay only when successful** (aligned incentives)
- **Clients get free basic access** (reduces adoption friction)
- **Premium features** unlock revenue from power users
- **Labs & OEMs pay for access to ecosystem** (B2B SaaS model)

**Hypothesis to Test**:
- Will facilities accept 10-15% commission? (Compare to their current CAC)
- What % of free clients convert to premium? (Target: 10-20%)
- What premium features do clients care most about?
- Would OEMs pay $100K+ for distributed manufacturing dashboard?

## Next Steps

1. **Print this canvas** (or use a large whiteboard)
2. **Color-code each box**:
   - 🟢 Green = Validated (evidence from 8+ interviews)
   - 🟡 Yellow = Partially validated (some evidence, needs more)
   - 🔴 Red = Invalidated (need to pivot)
   - ⚪ White = Not yet tested (still a guess)
3. **Update weekly** based on interview findings
4. **Share with team** for alignment

**Remember**: This entire canvas is a HYPOTHESIS. Expect 50%+ of it to change after your first 30 interviews.
